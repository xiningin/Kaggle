We allowed\nrespondents to complete the survey at any time during that window.\nThe median response time for those who participated in the survey was\napproximately 10 minutes.\n\nNot every question was shown to every respondent. You can learn more\nabout the different segments we used in the survey_schema.csv file. In general, \nrespondents with more experience were asked more questions and respondents \nwith less experience were asked less questions.\n\nTo protect the respondents\u2019 identity, the answers to multiple choice\nquestions have been separated into a separate data file from the\nopen-ended responses. We do not provide a key to match up the\nmultiple choice and free form responses. Further, the free form\nresponses have been randomized column-wise such that the responses\nthat appear on the same row did not necessarily come from the same\nsurvey-taker.\n\nMultiple choice single response questions fit into individual columns whereas \nmultiple choice multiple response questions were split into multiple columns.\nText responses were encoded to protect user privacy and countries with fewer\nthan 50 respondents were grouped into the category \"other\".","a21434fc":"This is the Kaggle's third annual Machine Learning and Data Science Survey.

We will be using these responses from the survey to understand the ML and DS state.\n\nThe results include raw numbers about who is working with data, what\u2019s happening with machine learning in different industries, and the best ways for new data scientists break into these fields.
