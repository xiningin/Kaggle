Unless specifically stained, they are not visible. In addition to supplying cellular energy, mitochondria are involved in other tasks, such as signaling, cellular differentiation, and cell death, as well as maintaining control of the cell cycle and cell growth. They are in the cytoplasm embedded by cytosol.  In this kind of samples we can have a picture of a entire cell and small scattered dots that represent mitochondrias:\n\n![mitochondria](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/LVvOjWJ.png)\n\nor ","0f1f85ef":"# just Cytosol (25)\n\n![cytosol](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/7\/71\/Simple_diagram_of_yeast_cell_%28es%29.svg\/800px-Simple_diagram_of_yeast_cell_%28es%29.svg.png)\n![cytosol](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/2wKXDqn.png)\n\nThe cytosol, also known as intracellular fluid (ICF) or cytoplasmic matrix, is the liquid found inside cells.[2] It is separated into compartments by membranes. For example, the mitochondrial matrix separates the mitochondrion into many compartments. \n\nIn this case the protein is in the cytosol which is the liquid found inside cells that contains all the organelles... That samples are quite similat to nucleoplasm ones because, as nucleoplasm is what are inside nucleous, cytosol is what is inside the cell membrane (all the cell) and they look similar. The main difference is that, inside cytosol, there is the nucleous... so, as our protein isn't present at nucleous, in that samlples the nucleous is black on the filtered reference.","8fc6d52f":"# just Nucleoplasm (0)\n\n![nucleoplasm](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/3\/38\/Diagram_human_cell_nucleus.svg\/462px-Diagram_human_cell_nucleus.svg.png)\n![nucleoplasm images](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/MrX7Nvn.png)\n\nThe nucleoplasm is one of the types of protoplasm, and it is enveloped by the nuclear membrane (also known as the nuclear envelope). The nucleoplasm includes the chromosomes and nucleolus. \n\nIf we visualice a fews samples labeled as Nucleoplasm we can see that they are quite different... what they have in common is that, in all of them, the protein is surrounded by something (nuclear membrane) and the protein appear arround all the nucleous of different cells. In some images that nucleous is circular in others is rather oval... but, in all of them the protein not appear in the whole cell but only in a limited zone of it (nucleous). With out protein mask we can see it better.\n\n\u00bfWhat need our model to learn in order to classify that?","217f6a27":"# Both, Cytosol and Nucleoplasm (25 0)\n\n![both cytosol and nucleoplasm](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/iXxpySu.png)\n\nThis is a sample where the protein appears in two different parts of the cell, both cytosol and nucleoplasm. In this case we can see how our protein mask keept the whole cell and we can distinguish the blue part (nucleoud) and the yellow one (cytosol) in most cases.","cff66cef":"Throught this kernel I will show different images of some combination of labels on the training dataset of the Protein Atlas Image Classification problem in order to better understand what is what we are predicting.\n\nAll image samples are represented by four filters (stored as individual files), the protein of interest (green) plus three cellular landmarks: nucleus (blue), microtubules (red), endoplasmic reticulum (yellow). The green filter should hence be used to predict the label, and the other filters are used as references. \n\nI will print the images as RGB, using the yellow channel as the green one and I will use the green channel as a mask to determine what part of the cell have the desired protein."}}
