Then we went to File>Save as Utility Script. \n\nWe followed the steps from [Kaggle's official documents here](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/product-feedback\/91185)\n\nNext step in this process was **Add the script**. Under \u201cFile\u201d, click \u201cAdd utility script\u201d. Search for the script you want and click to add it. You should see it listed under \u201cusr\/lib\u201d in the panel on the right hand side."}}
