This means whatever interactive plots you create can easily be shared in the same manner with your teammates or end-users.\n\nI also want to point out that Plotly supports a gamut of plots right from basic chart types, Seaborn-like beautiful and advanced plots, 3-D plots, Map-based visualizations, scientific plots, etc. The list is endless!\n\nPlotly\u2019s plots can also support animation capabilities as well. So, it\u2019s a pretty useful library if you want to do storytelling through visualizations.\n\n ","cd721ca3":"The first unique feature of Seaborn is that it is designed in such a way that you write way lesser code to achieve high-grade visualizations","ceb22dcb":"# Seaborn : ","34cff21e":"The first thing that comes to my mind when I think about Plotly is interactivity!

So that means when building visualizations, you can start with advanced plots that seaborn already supports and then customize them as much as you want with the help of matplotlib.","9464b3bc":"When I look at visualizations built by Seaborn, only one word comes to mind \u2013 beautiful! Seaborn is built on top of matplotlib and provides a very simple yet intuitive interface for building visualizations. When using Seaborn, you will also notice that many of the default settings in the plots work quite well right out of the box.","308368f3":"<img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.analyticsvidhya.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f643379346e776d2e676966.gif\"><\/img>"}}
