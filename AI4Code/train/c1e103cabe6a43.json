Distance Matrix API\nLet's import the package that we just installed","b3e44d7c":"## Summary\nI summarize the pros and cons of these two methods. For `Haversine formula`:\n* **Pros**\n    1. **Budget**: It is FREE !!!\n    2. **Efficiency**: Easy to calculate.\n    3. **Desent Baseline**: It is always worth to try this method since it generates good approximates to the real distance.\n* **Cons**\n    1. **Accuracy**: Although it seems performing well in this task, but it is hard to say when it comes to different tasks, because this method only provides approximations to real traffic scenarios.\n    \n    \nFor `Distance Matrix API`\n* **Pros**\n    1. **Accuracy**: `Distance Matrix API` provides values which more close to reality.\n    2. **Additional Information**: It also provides additional informations such as traffic time (duration) and address name.\n* **Cons**\n    1. **Time Consuming**: Obviously it is much slower than `Haversine formula`.\n    2. **Limited Number of Requests**: you will be charged for requesting more than cetain number of requests.","b398c539":"This notebook demonstrates how to apply [Distance Matrix API](https:\/\/developers.google.com\/maps\/documentation\/distance-matrix\/overview), a service provides travel distance and time for a matrix of origins and destinations from google, for getting more realistic distances against the conventional method. \n\n## 1. Conventional Method vs Distance Matrix API\n\n### Conventional method\nThe conventional method, a.k.a [Haversine formula](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Haversine_formula), is a very accurate way of computing distances between two points on the surface of a sphere using the latitude and longitude of the two points, one of its primary applications is navigation. You can find its realization in this [excellent notebook](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/madhurisivalenka\/cleansing-eda-modelling-lgbm-xgboost-starters) by Sivalenka. \nHowever, since the formula returns the shortest distance between two points which, as you know, is impossible for us to take when it comes to daily traffics.\n\n### Distance Matrix API\nIf you want to get more accurate distances from lat\/lon pairs, one you should consider is `Distance Matrix API`. It calculates distances base on google map algorithm, which is being used in our daily life. No matter you trust google map or not, it could definitely get you better results compares to the `Haversine formula`. Moreover, it also provides you to choose from a list of travel types, such as driving, walking, transit etc., and returns you the travel duration of the given mode.\n\nHowever, there are two major drawbacks of `Distance Matrix API`, the first is time consuming, it takes about 20~23 sec to process 1000 inputs in my cumputer, so you should prepare for a long run-time if your dataset is large. \n\nThe second, which I think is the biggest disadvantage, is you only get limited free request number to this API. Google provides you a $300 free trial to its products, after you run out this free trial account, you need to pay for additional access. As your reference, I ran out my free trial, and it completed about 650 thousans of samples. So make sure what you are doing before jump into it.\n\n### Let's get start!","7bd43976":"Once you are done, write the following code to sent request to google.","475a9a55":"The second step to complete our task is to enter your API key and setup `Client`. \n\nTo get the API key, go to [Getting started with Google Maps Platform](https:\/\/developers.google.com\/maps\/gmp-get-started).\n","19d5fe03":"### Distance Matrix API","15fd0765":"Google map wins the competetion! Correlation coefficient of `Distance Matrix API` distance to fare is at the top of the board, while `Haversine formula` still get a very decent performance. ","2f60c7b1":"Here is the difference! \n\nDistance suggested by `Distance Matrix API` is 1375m while distance suggested by `Haversine formula` is 1030.76m.\n\nIt is not surprising to see that `Haversine formula` under-estimates distance in this kind of problems, since it assumes you can always pick the straight way toward the destination.\n\n\nIn the next section, I am going to have a grand comparison between `Distance Matrix API` and `Haversine formula`, I will, considering the free trial limitation, calculate all of the training data as I can. Then campare them base on their correlation-coefficient values with the target value: `fare_amount`.\n\n### Let's move on!","10221be8":"Wow!
