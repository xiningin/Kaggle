Because, this case study is simple to understand and work. \n\nAs we are in a world, where being fit is very difficult. We all are used to make more carbs, mocktails and many other juncks. Intaking juncks nad continuing to be fit is impossible. One, to be fit we need to leave juncks or forget the wish to be fit for the junck.\nSo, this data set contains details of treadmill product buyers list with product bought, customer's age, gender, marital state, education, # of hours spent and # of miles.","0c87a05e":"**Checking for the null values **","e29759f6":"**seperated data by Gender**","53b5ef09":"# heatmap\n**Overview of the correlation of the different variables**","d119347e":"## The team identifies the following customer variables to study:\n\n1. product purchased, TM195, TM498, or TM798\n2. gender;\n3. age, in years;\n4. education, in years;\n5. relationship status, single or partnered;\n6. annual household income ;\n7. average number of times the customer plans to use the treadmill each week;\n8. average number of miles the customer expects to walk\/run each week;\n9. and self-rated fitness on an 1-to-5 scale, where 1 is poor shape and 5 is excellent shape.","e9b07706":"# Boxplots\n\n**#Which is the most popular model by gender?**","db383b45":"### Importing required libraries","7f2cb8d0":"**Shape of the data**"}}
