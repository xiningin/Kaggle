I'm Martijn, We are a team of professional hosts established by travelers just like you. We believe in sharing homes. Wherever you are, it is delightful to explore and discover an unknown city from an authentic home. On behalf of home owners we advertise their properties through our airbnb profile and support them by offering you a pleasant stay. When you book your holiday with us, you can be confident of a memorable stay and an experience through the eyes of a local. We are more than happy to share our knowledge, give you the best insider tips and recommendations about Amsterdam. If you have any questions, holiday wishes or simply want to have a chat, then feel free to contact us any time. We always reply within an hour! We look forward to being your host! :)","d6e98a0a":"## 2.3 Accommodates (number of people)\nAs expected, most listings are for 2 people. In addition, Airbnb uses a maximum of 16 guests per listing.","51c465fc":"## 5. Text mining the Review comments\n","3ff2dbe9":"## 4.5 Finding a good host\nAt Airbnb you can get the status \"Superhost\". From Airbnb:\n* As a Superhost, you\u2019ll have more visibility, earning potential, and exclusive rewards. It's our way of saying thank you for your outstanding hospitality.\n* How to become a Superhost: Every 3 months, we check if you meet the following criteria. If you do, you'll earn or keep your Superhost status.\n    * Superhosts have a 4.8 or higher average overall rating based on reviews from at least 50% of their Airbnb guests in the past year. \n    * Superhosts have hosted at least 10 stays in the past year or, if they host longer-term reservations, 100 nights over at least 3 stays. \n    * Superhosts have no cancellations in the past year, unless there were extenuating circumstances.\n    * Superhosts respond to 90% of new messages within 24 hours.\n\nBelow, we can see that only a small portion of the listings in Amsterdam do have a host who is Superhost.","4eb52e88":"Below, you will find the 5 hosts with most reviews. It is interesting to see the names of hosts Martijn and Feliciano again, who have been discussed before ;-).","e0ffd7f0":"Below, I diplay the hosts with more that 20 listings. Unfortunately, the host_about is not fully scraped. However as this dataset is extremely recent, it was not hard for me to find the host description of the host with 200+ listings on airbnb.com. As you can see, this host clearly is a professional host!\n\nAs it is probably hard to implement and control a measure that completely forbids professional hosting activities, I would advise the municipality of Amsterdam to consider setting a maximum number of listings per host. If Amsterdam would set this at for instance 10 (and manages to get this implemented in Airbnb's systems), it would becomes much harder to exploit hosting at Airbnb as a professional activity.","95ba4565":"## 1.2 The listings and listing details files\nThe dataset that I created contains a total of 7 files. The listings file is an overview file that insideairbnb labels as \"good for visualizations\". The unique identifier in the dataset is the \"listing\" id. This is basically the id of the advertisement. Overall, there were 20,030 Airbnb-listings in Amsterdam on December 6th, 2018.","90e9af38":"However, we have the GPS-coordinates of the listings. To me, it seems very likely that all private rooms that host Feliciano offers are in fact in the same building (only minor variations in latitude\/longitude). Although this host might have a hotel license, his listings seem suspicious too me (what is the name of the hotel?)! I would advise the municipality of Amsterdam to check if no rules are broken in this case.","cfd7cb44":"The listings file contains 15 variables per listing besides the id.","7e6f9458":"A sample of the calendar data is shown below. Important to note: availability is FALSE means that either the owner does not want to rent out his property on the specific date, or the listing has been booked for that date already. As I want to compare apples-to-apples again regarding the prices in the next section, I am merging the 'accomodates' variable with the calendar.","6eca05ca":"However, many of those property types have very few listings in Amsterdam. In the figure below, I am only displaying property types with at least 100 listings. As we can see, the vast majority of the properties in Amsterdam are apartments.","8120b509":"Below, we see that up to three months ahead, there are generally more accomodations available than further into the future. Reasons for this might be that hosts are more actively updating their calendars in this timeframe. This graph is **interactive**, and hovering over the points will show you a tooltip with the \"number of available listings\" and \"weekday\" by date.","77871d31":"# Preface\nPeople who have read other kernels of mine, would probably be surprised by this one. Indeed, this is **my very first Python kernel**. Am I going to abandon R? Certainly not! I just want to broaden my options and knowledge, and strongly believe that I will continue to use both in the future. My initial thoughts on this are:\n\n* Use R for EDAs. Although visualizations with Python are not bad, ggplot just looks better and I find it quite easy to compose visualizations with ggplot. Also, Rmarkdown offers neat additional features that Python does not have (such as Tabs, and automatic generation of the Table of Content).\n* Use R for statistics\n* Use R for creating interactive web apps (with Shiny)\n* Use Python for machine learning and deep learning\n* Use Python for big datasets. I know that R can handle big datasets too with data.table, but I am a big fan of tidyverse. The readability of code decreases when using data.table, and I chose not to learn it. \n* Chose R or Python depending on the libraries available. CRAN (R) has many more (data science) libraries than Python. I know for instance that there are domain specific packages for Finance. If R or Python offers a specific package that really suits the task at hand, I will likely choose the language with the best libraries on offer.\n\nInsideairbnb.com is a website on which web scraped datasets of \"snapshots\" of cities are published. I have downloaded the files of Amsterdam of the situation on December 6th, 2018. I thought it is a fun dataset to take on. Besides basic data wrangling and plots, I have also added **interactive Folium maps, interactive plotly graphs, and text mining of the review comments.**\n<br>\n<center><img src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/gEX4RCf.png\"><\/center>\n<br>\n\n\n# Table of contents\n\n* [1.

I can imagine that having the option to outsource these activities leads to even more listings. At the moment, about 75% of the hosts only have one listing. I assume that hosts with just a couple of listings are likely to also be the host for a couple of friends. However, we see that there are extreme cases. I believe that it becomes unlikely that hosts with more than 10 listings are just doing this for themselves and friends and family.","ed627245":"Below you can find the neighbourhoods on a map.

As you can see, nowadays the western parts of the city are the most dangerous.\n\nPersonal note: Apparently \"de Bijlmer\" (south-eastern areas) is reasonably safe these days. However, I used to know somebody who lived there as a student years ago. At that time it certainly was not a good neighbourhood, and I was warned to \"stay under the balconies\" as people might throw rubbish and old furniture from their balconies. Getting an old couch on your head did not sound like the most pleasant thing in the world ;-).\n\n<center><img src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/7cso9GD.png\" style=\"width: 800px;\"\/><\/center>","d5107962":"Below I am doing some basic pre processing.","e64cdf23":"# 2.

Advice to the municipality of Amsterdam\n\nIt is known that Airbnb causes problems in Amsterdam. These problems are described well in this article: [Fed Up With Tourists, Amsterdam Gets Tough On Airbnb, Tourist Taxes And Too Much Partying](https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/ceciliarodriguez\/2018\/05\/17\/amsterdam-overwhelmed-by-tourists-gets-tough-on-airbnb-tourists-taxes-too-much-partying\/#5c6c78892be5)\n\n>The coalition of parties forming the city\u2019s new government wants to follow the examples of Barcelona and Venice, where the flood of unruly tourism has made life extremely unpleasant for residents, forcing  officials to try to control the number of visitors and their behavior.\n\nExtra rules that Amsterdam has in place when compared to Airbnb's own rules are:\n\n* The maximum number of guests is 4 (see also previous section)\n* The maximum number for short-term rental is 60 days per calendar year. This rules is only for renting out entire properties, and therefore does not apply to renting out private rooms. This rule was already enforced by Airbnb (after 60 days of bookings, Airbnb closes the availability of the listing for the rest of the year). As you can read in the article, the number will be lowered to a maximum of 30 days a year.\n* Amsterdam intends to ban Airbnb entirely in three neighourhoods: de Wallen (Red Light District), Kinkerbuurt and Haarlemmerbuurt\n* For renting out Private Rooms, there is also the restriction that an owner cannot rent-out rooms that accumulate to more than 40% of the total surface (in square meters)\n\n## 3.1 Finding possibly illegal hotels\nAny owner renting out more than 40% of his\/her property as Private Rooms is breaking the last rule mentioned in the previous section, but in this section I am only going to look for extreme cases.\n\nBelow, I am displaying the  five hosts having the most Private Room listings. Unfortunately, Airbnb does not give the addresses of the listings. The field \"street\" is actually in the database, but as you can see these are certainly not full, real addresses! Therefore, from this table I cannot say if these listings from are in fact in the same house.\n","bad6ef26":"## 4.6 Availability over time\nThe calendar file holds 365 records for each listing, which means that for each listing the price and availablity by date is specified 365 days ahead.","479240ab":"The listings_details file contains a total of 96 variables. I am not going to use all of these, but selectively joined a number of variables that seemed useful to me for this EDA.","cb76a548":"## 4.3 Review scores location, and location scores versus price\nIn tis section, I am grouping the review scores for the location by neighbourhood (only listings with at least 10 reviews). Although I expect the distance to the city centre to an important factor, these score should also take other things into account. Other factors may include:\n\n* The safety of a location (as displayed in the previous section)\n* Noise. If a listing is centrally located, but surrounded by noisy bars, that should cost points in the location review score.\n* If a listing is located outside the city centre but well connected by public transportation, it should get bonus points for that.\n* Facilities near the listing. Are there any supermarkets, bars and restaurants nearby?\n* Some people may be looking for free parking if they come by car (parking is very expensive in Amsterdam in general).\n\nBelow we see that the central neighbourhoods, which were generally also the most expensive, generally also score higher on location review score.  If I would calculate the distance to the city centre for each listing, I expect to see pretty strong correlations between this distance with both price and location review score.\n\nWhen looking at the average review score, I am surprised to see that the average is above 8\/10 for all neighbourhoods! I know that Amsterdam is a small city (much smaller than many people might think!). Therefore, it does not take much time to get to the city centre from anywhere, which might explain the high averages to a certain extend. My personal advice to tourists would be to consider more affordable accommodation outside the city centre, in a safe neighbourhood, and with good public transportation connections to the city centre anyway. However, are the differences between the best locations and outside neighbourhoods really that small? Let's find out in the next section!\n","672c2f90":"# 4. Advice to the tourists\n## 4.1 Average daily price per neighbourhood\nIn order to compare \"apples to apples\" I have only selected the most common type of accommodation, which is accommodation for 2 persons. As expected, accommodation in the city centre is the most expensive. ","f2742429":"We see that neighbourhood_group is useless in Amsterdam, as it contains zero non-null objects. Below, I getting rid of this variable, and am showing the head of the dataframe that I am going to work with.","0497d585":"**This is just a start of the text mining. To be continued in the next version!**","71eb15b0":"In addition to removing the stopwords, I also wanted to remove the host names. However the list of host names contains over 5,000 words, and removing those takes a long time. Therefore, I am not removing them yet at this point.","f73ddc84":"I don't think that the outcomes of text mining the review comments will be usefull as specific advice to tourists. Therefore, I created a separate section for this. Why am I still analyzing the comments? Just because I can, and want to learn text mining with Python anyway ;-).\n\nThe \"reviews\" file turned out to be not very interesting, as it only holds review dates for each listing, which means that it is only good for counting numbers of reviews. The \"reviews_details\" file holds the same information (and the same number of records), with 4 additional columns. In addition, I merged the listing's host_id and host_names with the reviews_details file.","c93dd6d3":"### 2.2.2 Property types\nIn the dataset, we find a lot of different property types.","a4d96c95":"## 4.4 How to use review scores\nIn addition to written reviews, guests can submit an overall star rating and a set of category star ratings. Guests can give ratings on:\n\n* Overall Experience. What was your overall experience?\n* Cleanliness. Did you feel that your space was clean and tidy?\n* Accuracy. How accurately did your listing page represent your space?\n* Value. Did you feel your listing provided good value for the price?\n* Communication. How well did you communicate with your host before and during their stay?\n* Arrival. How smoothly did their check-in go?\n* Location. How did you feel about the neighborhood?\n\nBelow you can see the scores distribution of all those categories. What caught my eye immediately is that scores seem really high across the board! A quick internet search told me that this seems common across Airbnb. It is explained well in this article: [Higher than the average rating? 95% of Airbnb listings rated 4.5 to 5 stars](https:\/\/mashable.com\/2015\/02\/25\/airbnb-reviews-above-average\/?europe=true#1YLfzOC34sqd).\n\nAfter having seen the scores distributions, I would personally consider any score of 8 or lower to be not a good score. If I wanted to use any of these scores in a search for accomodation, I believe the \"Value\" seems most useful. First of all, I always like to get good value for money ;-). However, the number of \"10 averages\" is reasonably small, which makes the indicator a bit more \"distinguishable\" than other indicators.","bf3f5f20":"## 4.7 Average price by date\nBelow, you see the average price of all 2-persons accomodations flagged as available by date. The peak of average price 240 Euro is at December 31st, and the cyclical pattern is due to higher prices in weekends. However, I suspect that prices for dates further ahead in time are mostly not updated yet and are probably default prices. This might result in a booking not being accepted by the host if the host realizes that someone is trying to book something on a date that should have been more expensive than usual. This graph is **interactive**, and hovering over the points will show you a tooltip with the average price and weekday by date.","bb94fd78":"Below you can find my first attempt to find the most used words using the CountVectorizer() function of sklearn.","c9fc48f3":"## 2.2 Room types and property types\n### 2.2.1 Room types\nThe room type is very important in Amsterdam, because Amsterdam has a rule that Entire homes\/apartments can only be rented out via Airbnb for a maximum of 60 days a year. Below, we can see that this restriction applies to most of the listings.","012a4b15":"However, Amsterdam has an additional restriction. Due to fire hazard considerations and also taking possible noisy group into account, owners are only allowed to rent their property to groups with a maximum of 4 people. This actually means that the listings that indicate that the maximum number of people is above 4 are breaking this rule!","ccd646d3":"Below, you can see that most listings are in the city centre. This map is interactive, and you can zoom-in on the clusters to eventually find the individual locations of the listings.\n\nNote: In a later version I made a map on the average daily price per neighoudhood (section 4.1). I think this map would also be better at this point (as it uses the neighbourhood shapefile), but as my main goal of this kernel is to learn as much as possible I left the map below unchanged as FastMarkerCluster seems useful for the future.","cd47caed":"If I were to book accomomodation, I would not necessarily look for a superhost. Actually, I would be afraid that I would pay too much as superhost will likely increase their prices. However, I would also not want to host that responds badly, or cancels a lot.\n\nAs we can see, over 5,000 of the 20,000 listings have at least 10 reviews and respond to at least 90% of the new messages. I would consider those hosts \"proven\" good responders (which does not mean that a listing with less than 10 reviews cannot have good responding hosts; it is just not proven yet). Also, there are very few listings with hosts not replying to new messages within 24 hours."}}
