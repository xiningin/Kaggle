Controversies have kept the Patriots' critics alive for years, but that hasn't stopped the 41-year-old all-star from racking up title after title. Going for ring No. 6 after a runner-up finish against the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LII, Brady has already rewritten the record books and enters this year's culminating showcase with a familiar supporting cast -- one that's starred Julian Edelman and Rob Gronkowski for years.**\n\n**Against the Kansas City Chiefs, the Patriots ran 94 offensive plays. Only one went for negative yardage, and that was a Tom Brady kneel-down at the end of regulation. That tells you how good this team is at execution and the \"little things\". Similarly, they ran 94 plays compared to KC's 47 and dominated time of possession. They are outstanding at football's fundamentals.**\n\n**Brady is surrounded by a trio of great runners in Sony Michel, James White and Rex Burkhead, but don't overlook the brilliance of blocking fullback James Develin. On the outside, Julian Edelman always comes up big in the most important moments, Rob Gronkowski will be a Hall of Fame tight end, and receivers Chris Hogan and Phillip Dorsett are capable of being game-changers. They are so tough to defend**\n\n**Belichick simply always finds a way to get it done. He is the longest-tenured head coach in the league right now, and his success has been spectacular. After losing in last year's Super Bowl, many people thought the Patriots' dynasty might be over. When they started 1-2, the chatter continued. After another pair of defeats in December, they were all but written off for this season's Super Bowl. But it is the Patriots!**\n\n**Although everyone loves to hate New England, what they have done in the past couple of decades should be admired.

One thing to note from that 2016 game against the Rams is just how they ran their play fakes. I wonder if they were concerned about Donald blowing up their play-action game. As my colleague Matt Bowen is fond of noting, the Patriots love to pull a guard as part of their play-action game.
