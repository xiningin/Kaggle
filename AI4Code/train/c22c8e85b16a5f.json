You should only ask for the number of servings once.\n* The program should then output the total number of ounces of each ingredient required to make the desired number of servings.\n\nAn example run of your program might look like this:\n\n```\nEnter ingredient 1: mixed greens\nOunces of mixed greens: 1.7\nEnter ingredient 2: blueberries\nOunces of blueberries: 2.0\nEnter ingredient 3: walnuts\nOunces of walnuts: 0.2\nNumber of servings: 3\n\nTotal ounces of mixed greens: 5.1\nTotal ounces of blueberries: 6.0\nTotal ounces of walnuts: 0.6\n```\n\nWant to make it better? Implement input validation so that your program requires the user enter a word for the ingredients and a number for the number of ounces.","8baa5f56":"#Reflection","002f17f4":"The hardest part of this project was me not trying different codes.
