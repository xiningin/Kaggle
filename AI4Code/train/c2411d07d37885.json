known as SARIMAX, which stands for Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Averages with eXogenous regressors\n\n-> What does an Arima model do?\n\n    Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average Model. An ARIMA model is a class of statistical models for    analyzing and forecasting time series data. It explicitly caters to a suite of standard structures in time series data, and as such provides a simple yet powerful method for making skillful time series forecasts.\n\n-> How to select perfect ARIMA model?\n\n    Rules for identifying ARIMA models. General seasonal models: ARIMA (0,1,1)x(0,1,1) etc. Identifying the order of differencing and the constant: If the series has positive autocorrelations out to a high number of lags (say, 10 or more), then it probably needs a higher order of differencing.","c4090830":"### Context\n\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.

Often this is done to help improve understanding of the time series, but it can also be used to improve forecast accuracy.\n\n\n### Types of decomposition :\n* Multiplicative : The components multiply together to make the time series. If you have an increasing        trend, the amplitude of seasonal activity increases. Everything becomes more exaggerated.\n* Additive : In an additive time series, the components add together to make the time series.\n  (Here we used Additive)","fb549e15":"## Data Visualization","eb082138":"## Preparing Model","f7ff143a":"### now we will only see top 10 contaminated ","20fcf350":"So what is Time Series?\n\n1. A time series is a series of data points indexed (or listed or graphed) in time order. Most commonly, a time series is a sequence taken at successive equally spaced points in time. Thus it is a sequence of discrete-time data.\n2. An observed time series can be decomposed into three components:\n   * the trend (long term direction)\n   * the seasonal (systematic, calendar related movements) \n   * the irregular (unsystematic, short term fluctuations).\n3. Time series analysis is a statistical technique that deals with time series data, or trend analysis. Time series data means that data is in a series of particular time periods or intervals.","b50583d6":"#### Now lets plot a graph showing the increasing trend and seasonality in the data","35d2a508":"### now we will only see top 10 states with dead ppl","51ec82f5":"### In above we can also notice \"Telenagana\" and \"Telangana\" which both are same state ,but just a spelling mistake.\n### so we can replace all the name with \"Telengana\" to \"Telangana\" so our visualization will be more accurate.","68a3aa63":"### Here we created a new \"future_data_ts\" which has weekly dates of 2021","f612372d":"### you see that we have so many dublicates that ending with '***' , we can drop or replace them if we want\n### I'm droping ","6e15458b":"## Time Series Analysis For 'Telangana' State"}}
