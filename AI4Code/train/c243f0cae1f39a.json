You must accept the competition rules in order to participate. These rules govern how many submissions you can make per day, the maximum team size, and other competition-specific details. Click on **\"I Understand and Accept\"** to indicate that you will abide by the competition rules.\n\n# Commit your Notebook #\n\n**Committing** your notebook will run a fresh copy of the notebook start to finish, saving a copy of the `submission.csv` file as output.\n\nFirst, click on the **Save Version** button in the upper right.\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ebMUMSq.png\" alt=\"The blue Save Version button.\" width=300>\n<\/figure>\n\nChoose **Advanced Settings**.\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/sx9l1fL.png\" alt=\"Advanced Settings in the Version menu.\" width=600>\n<\/figure>\n\nSelect **Run with TPU for this session** from the dropdown menu and click the blue **Save** button.\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/1cB5ykf.png\" alt=\"The Accelerator dropdown menu.\" width=600>\n<\/figure>\n\nSelect **Save & Run All (Commit)** and click the blue **Save** button.\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/YeJLsNG.png\" alt=\"The Save Version menu.\" width=600>\n<\/figure>\n\nThe commit may take a while to finish (about 10-15 min), but there's no harm in doing something else while it's running and coming back later.\n\nThis generates a window in the bottom left corner of the notebook.
