This relationship can be used to create new features with feature transformation and feature interaction. Target encoding could be very useful as well because of the high correlations with `Survived` feature.\n\nSplit points and spikes are visible in continuous features. They can be captured easily with a decision tree model, but linear models may not be able to spot them.\n\nCategorical features have very distinct distributions with different survival rates. Those features can be one-hot encoded. Some of those features may be combined with each other to make new features.\n\nCreated a new feature called `Deck` and dropped `Cabin` feature at the **Exploratory Data Analysis** part.\n-->","85d31df7":"'Family_Survival_Rate'\ub294 \ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ub2dd \uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uac00\uc871\uc5d0\uc11c \uacc4\uc0b0\ub41c\ub2e4. \uc65c\ub0d0\ud558\uba74, \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 'Survived' feature\uac00 \uc5c6\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc774\ub2e4. \ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ub2dd\uacfc \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc14b('non_unique_families')\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uac00\uc871 \uc774\ub984 \ubaa9\ub85d\uc774 \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c\ub2e4. \uc0dd\uc874\uc728\uc740 \uadf8 \ubaa9\ub85d\uc5d0\uc11c 1\uba85\uc758 \uba64\ubc84\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub9ce\uc740 \uac00\uc871\ub4e4\ub85c \uacc4\uc0b0\ub418\uace0,'Family_Survived_Rate' feature\uc5d0 \uc800\uc7a5\ub41c\ub2e4.\n\n\ucd94\uac00 binary feature\uc778 'Family_Survival_Rate_NA'\ub294 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\uc77c\ud55c \uac00\uc871\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c\ub2e4. \uc774 feature\ub3c4 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \uc65c\ub0d0\ud558\uba74, \uac00\uc871\uc758 \uc0dd\uc874\uc728\uc744 \uacc4\uc0b0\ud560 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc5c6\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774 feature\ub294 \uac00\uc871 \uc0dd\uc874\uc728\uc774 \uc2b9\uac1d\ub4e4\uc5d0 \uc801\ud569\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ub0b4\ud3ec\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc65c\ub0d0\ud558\uba74 \uc0dd\uc874\uc728\uc744 \ucc3e\uc744 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc5c6\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc774\ub2e4.\n\n'Ticket_Survival_Rate'\uc640 Ticket_Survival_Rate_NA' feature \ub610\ud55c \uac19\uc740 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c\ub2e4.

Binning helped dealing with outliers and it revealed some homogeneous groups in those features. `Family_Size` is created by adding `Parch` and `SibSp` features and **1**. `Ticket_Frequency` is created by counting the occurence of `Ticket` values.\n\n`Name` feature is very useful. First, `Title` and `Is_Married` features are created from the title prefix in the names. Second, `Family_Survival_Rate` and `Family_Survival_Rate_NA`  features are created by target encoding the surname of the passengers. `Ticket_Survival_Rate` is created by target encoding the `Ticket` feature. `Survival_Rate` feature is created by averaging the `Family_Survival_Rate` and `Ticket_Survival_Rate` features.\n\nFinally, the non-numeric type features are label encoded and categorical features are one-hot encoded. Created **5** new features (`Family_Size`, `Title`, `Is_Married`, `Survival_Rate` and `Survival_Rate_NA`) and dropped the useless features after encoding.\n-->","869f36b7":"### **3.1 Random Forest**\n2\uac1c\uc758 'RandomForestClassifier'\ub97c \ub9cc\ub4e0\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub4e4 \uc911 \ud558\ub098\ub294 \uc2f1\uae00 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774\uace0, \ub098\uba38\uc9c4 k-fold cross validation\uc774\ub2e4.\n\n'single_best_model'\uc758 \uac00\uc7a5 \ub192\uc740 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc740 public leaderboard\uc5d0\uc11c **0.82775**\uc774\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098, \uadf8\uac83\uc740 k-fold cross validation\uc5d0\uc11c \ub354 \uc88b\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub0b4\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294\ub2e4. \uadf8\uac83\uc740 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \ud29c\ub2dd\uacfc \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \uc2dc\uc791\ud558\uae30 \uc88b\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774\ub2e4.\n\n'leaderboard_model'\uc758 \uac00\uc7a5 \ub192\uc740 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc740 5-fold cross validation\uc744 \ud55c public leaderboard\uc5d0\uc11c **0.83732**\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 leaderboard \uc810\uc218\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uc0dd\uc131\ub418\uace0, \uc57d\uac04 overfit\ud558\uac8c \ud29c\ub2dd\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uac83\uc740 \ub9e4 fold\ub9c8\ub2e4 'X_test'\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uce21\uc815\ub41c \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 **N**(fold \uac1c\uc218)\ub85c \ub098\ub220\uc9c8 \uac83\uc774\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 overfit\ud558\uac8c \uc124\uacc4 \ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \ub9cc\uc57d \uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc2f1\uae00\ubaa8\ub378\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub41c\ub2e4\uba74, \uc774\uac83\uc740 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \uc62c\ubc14\ub974\uac8c \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud798\uaca8\uc6b8 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4.\n\n**\uc5b4\ub290 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub098?**\n* 'leaderboard_model'\uc740 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc14b\uc5d0 overfit\ud55c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub798\uc11c \uc2e4\uc0dd\ud65c \ud504\ub85c\uc81d\ud2b8\ucc98\ub7fc \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294\ub370 \uc801\ud569\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub2e4.\n* 'single_best_model'\uc740 \uacb0\uc815\ud2b8\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc2e4\ud5d8\ud558\uace0 \uacf5\ubd80\ud558\uae30\ub97c \uc2dc\uc791\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc88b\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774\ub2e4.\n\n<!--\nCreated 2 `RandomForestClassifier`'s.

To conclude, cabins used by 1st class passengers have higher survival rates than cabins used by 2nd and 3rd class passengers. In my opinion **M** (Missing `Cabin` values) has the lowest survival rate because they couldn't retrieve the cabin data of the victims.
