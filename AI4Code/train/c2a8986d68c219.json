The 6 steps of Data Analysis is used to present this analysis.\n\nTitle: Bellabeat Case Study\n\nAuthor: Dominic Atuahene\n\nDate: October 23rd 2021\n\n\n\nBellabeat: How Can A Wellness Technology Company Play It Smart?\n* STEP 1: ASK\n1.0 Background\u00b6\nBellabeat is a high-tech manufacturer of beautifully-designed health-focused smart products for women since 2013. Inspiring and empowering women with knowledge about their own health and habits, Bellabeat has grown rapidly and quickly positioned itself as a tech-driven wellness company for females.\n\n* The co-founder and Chief Creative Officer, Ur\u0161ka Sr\u0161en is confident that an analysis of non-Bellebeat consumer data (ie. FitBit fitness tracker usage data) would reveal more opportunities for growth.\n\n* 1.2 Business Task:\nAnalyze FitBit Fitness Tracker Data to gain insights into how consumers are using the FitBit app and discover trends and insights for Bellabeat marketing strategy.\n* 1.3 Business Objectives:\n* What are the trends identified?\n* How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?\n* How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?\n* 1.4 Deliverables:\n* A clear summary of the business task\n* A description of all data sources used\n* Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data\n* A summary of analysis\n* Supporting visualizations and key findings\n* High-level content recommendations based on the analysis\n* 1.5 Key Stakeholders:\nUr\u0161ka Sr\u0161en: Bellabeat\u2019s cofounder and Chief Creative Officer\nSando Mur: Mathematician, Bellabeat\u2019s cofounder and key member of the Bellabeat executive team\nBellabeat marketing analytics team: A team of data analysts guiding Bellabeat's marketing strategy.\n* STEP 2: PREPARE\n* 2.1 Information on Data Source:\nThe data is publicly available on Kaggle: FitBit Fitness Tracker Data and stored in 18 csv files.\nGenerated by respondents from a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 12 March 2016 to 12 May 2016.\n* 30 FitBit users who consented to the submission of personal tracker data.\n* Data collected includes (1) physical activity recorded in minutes, (2) heart rate, (3) sleep monitoring, (4) daily activity and (5) steps.\n* 2.2 Limitations of Data Set:\n* Data collected from year 2016. Users' daily activity, fitness and sleeping habits, diet and food consumption may have changed since then, hence data may not be timely or relevant.\n* Sample size of 30 female FitBit users is not representative of the entire female population.\n* As data is collected in a survey, hence unable to ascertain the integrity or accuracy of data.\n2.3 Is Data ROCCC?\n* A good data source is ROCCC which stands for Reliable, Original, Comprehensive, Current, and Cited.\n\n* Reliable - LOW - Not reliable as it only has 30 respondents\n* Original - LOW - Third party provider (Amazon Mechanical Turk)\n* Comprehensive - MED - Parameters match most of Bellabeat's products' parameters\n* Current - LOW - Data is 5 years old and is not relevant\n* Cited - LOW - Data collected from third party, hence unknown\n* Overall, the dataset is considered bad quality data and it is not recommended to produce business * recommendations based on this data.","5faa98f8":"STEP 4: SHARE\u00b6\n\nIn this step, we are creating visualizations and communicating our findings based on our analysis.\n\n5.1 Data Visualisation and Findings","d14a2f38":"*Counting the unique ID to confirm whether data set has 30 IDs as stated by the data source\n\n","d3049e88":"From the above observation,we noted that :\n\n* There is no typo, Null or missing values.\n\n* Data frame has 940 rows and 15 columns.\n\n* ActivityDate has already been converted to datetime64 dtype (yyyy-mm-dd) from object class @ 2.0\n\n* There are 33 unique IDs, instead of 30 unique IDs as expected from 30 fitness tracker users.","9f0a304f":"<b>3.0 Data Cleaning and Manipulation\n\n* checking for null values in the data\n","b6c04a42":"This case study is the Capstone Project of Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate.\n* The 6 steps of Data Analysis is used to present this analysis.\n\n<b>Title: Bellabeat Case Study\n    <b> Author : Dominic Atuahene\n       * Date : October 23 2021","538ebbda":"<b>Now we have created and added needed columns , we are ready for analysis of our data and visualization\n\n","8431e636":"Interpreting statistical findings:\n\nOn average, users logged 7,637 steps or 5.4km which is not adequate.

How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?\n\nBoth companies develop products focused on providing women with their health, habit and fitness data and encouraging them to understand their current habits and make healthy decisions. These common trends surrounding health and fitness can very well be pplied to Bellabeat customers.\n3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?\n\nBellabeat marketing team can encourage users by educating and equipping them with knowledge about fitness benefits, suggest different types of exercise (ie. simple 10 minutes exercise on weekday and a more intense exercise on weekends) and calories intake and burnt rate information on the Bellabeat app.\n\nOn weekends, Bellabeat app can also prompt notification to encourage users to exercise.\n\n* Bellabeast can also align activity points with Healthy life apps such as Vitality which rewards redeemable points which can be used on stores such as amazon, ebay etc. this may encourage users to earn more points through moderate to rigorous activities.","63fc0996":"Bellabeat: How Can A Wellness Technology Company Play It Smart?","ffd1065a":"From above, we can deduce that Calories burned has a positive correlation to steps taken.\nit is obvious from the plot that users burned the least on fridays.","aeafd1a4":"<b>3.1 Data Manipulation\n\n* Create new column DayOfTheWeek by separating the date into day of the week for further analysis.\n\n* Create new column TotalMins being the sum of these columns (VeryActiveMinutes, FairlyActiveMinutes, LightlyActiveMinutes and SedentaryMinutes).\n\n* Create new column TotalHours by converting new column in #4 to number of hours.\n\n* Rearrange and rename columns.","98dbea1f":"<b>Calories burned for every step taken\nFrom the scatter plot, we discovered that:\n\nThere is a positive correlation.\n\nWe observed that intensity of calories burned increase when users are at the range of > 0 to 15,000 steps with calories burn rate cooling down from 15,000 steps onwards.\n\nNoted a few outliers:\n\nZero steps with zero to minimal calories burned.\n1 observation of > 35,000 steps with < 3,000 calories burned.\nDeduced that outliers could be due to natural variation of data, change in user's usage or errors in data collection (ie. miscalculations, data contamination or human error).","6913f6b8":"2.
