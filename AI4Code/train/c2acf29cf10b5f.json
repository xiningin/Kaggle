This DataFrame is accessible to us directly using the `apply()` method, and we can then manipulate the data in any way we see fit. For example, here's one way of selecting the name of the first wine reviewed from each winery in the dataset:","6fb770ea":"Effective use of `groupby()` will allow you to do lots of really powerful things with your dataset.","34b953da":"Finally, know that you can sort by more than one column at a time:","3d6473b7":"# Multi-indexes\n\nIn all of the examples we've seen thus far we've been working with DataFrame or Series objects with a single-label index. `groupby()` is slightly different in the fact that, depending on the operation we run, it will sometimes result in what is called a multi-index.\n\nA multi-index differs from a regular index in that it has multiple levels. For example:","6d4f5ffa":"To sort by index values, use the companion method `sort_index()`. This method has the same arguments and default order:","a56a7592":"`sort_values()` defaults to an ascending sort, where the lowest values go first. However, most of the time we want a descending sort, where the higher numbers go first. That goes thusly:","490fb1ac":"---\n\n\n\n\n*Have questions or comments?

Then, for each of these groups, we grabbed the `points()` column and counted how many times it appeared.  `value_counts()` is just a shortcut to this `groupby()` operation. \n\nWe can use any of the summary functions we've used before with this data. For example, to get the cheapest wine in each point value category, we can do the following:","9586fd99":"# Sorting\n\nLooking again at `countries_reviewed` we can see that grouping returns data in index order, not in value order. That is to say, when outputting the result of a `groupby`, the order of the rows is dependent on the values in the index, not in the data.\n\nTo get data in the order want it in we can sort it ourselves.  The `sort_values()` method is handy for this.","40bdc671":"# Introduction\n\nMaps allow us to transform data in a DataFrame or Series one value at a time for an entire column. However, often we want to group our data, and then do something specific to the group the data is in. \n\nAs you'll learn, we do this with the `groupby()` operation.  We'll also cover some additional topics, such as more complex ways to index your DataFrames, along with how to sort your data.\n\n**To start the exercise for this topic, please click [here](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/kernels\/fork\/598715).**\n\n# Groupwise analysis\n\nOne function we've been using heavily thus far is the `value_counts()` function.

They also require two levels of labels to retrieve a value. Dealing with multi-index output is a common \"gotcha\" for users new to pandas.\n\nThe use cases for a multi-index are detailed alongside instructions on using them in the [MultiIndex \/ Advanced Selection](https:\/\/pandas.pydata.org\/pandas-docs\/stable\/advanced.html) section of the pandas documentation.\n\nHowever, in general the multi-index method you will use most often is the one for converting back to a regular index, the `reset_index()` method:","d72b0b46":"For even more fine-grained control, you can also group by more than one column. For an example, here's how we would pick out the best wine by country _and_ province:","5673ee53":"Another `groupby()` method worth mentioning is `agg()`, which lets you run a bunch of different functions on your DataFrame simultaneously.
