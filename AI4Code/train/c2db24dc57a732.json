The basic idea is that more than one model work together to predict some outcome. Actually, boosting as used in xgboost or lightgbm was originally proposed as an ensemble learning technique. A good introduction to ensemble learning can be found in Hastie et al. (2017), \u201cElements of Statistical Learning\u201d (Chapter 16 http:\/\/web.stanford.edu\/~hastie\/ElemStatLearn\/). Averaging and Stacking are described in Section 8.8 of the book. \n\nA nice \u201chands on\u201d description of Stacking can be found at the Kaggle Blog, posted by Ben Gorman http:\/\/blog.kaggle.com\/2016\/12\/27\/a-kagglers-guide-to-model-stacking-in-practice\/. \n\nA good overview on ensemble methods is provided here: https:\/\/www.analyticsvidhya.com\/blog\/2018\/06\/comprehensive-guide-for-ensemble-models\/.\n\nWriting a stacking code on your own can be fun. However, there are many little helpers out there. I use *mlxtend* in this post: http:\/\/rasbt.github.io\/mlxtend\/user_guide\/classifier\/StackingClassifier\/.\n\nLet\u2019s load and prepare some data first. Please note that I only use 5000 obs. here for demonstration:\n","1dd12584":"The next step is to train and stack some models. Here I use KNN, RF, and NB. The tree models will be stacked using Logit. In the code below, the models and the stacking classifier are defined first. Then each model is trained using CV.\n\nFinally, the stacking classifier is fitted and predictions are obtained. All that we need to do now is to get the predictions into the right shape to make a submission.\n\nAs you can see, the AUC is rather low here and not at all competitive compared to the LB. However, its just a minimal example.\n\nLet me know if you have any comments: happy coding!\n"}}
