The heatmap of Covid-19 incidence in Europe correlates neatly with the map of the countries there without a BCG vaccination policy.\n\nRich countries eradicated TB long before others, and haven\u2019t had to inoculate their population with BCG. India, historically having a huge TB burden, has had a universal BCG vaccination policy for a long time.\n\nThere can be many confounding factors, as the paper acknowledges, and correlation doesn\u2019t imply causation. But if results of definitive clinical trials confirm causation, BCG could become our armour against Covid, as it will likely become a seasonal affliction.\n\nThere\u2019s an easy way of probing the correlation deeper. BCG, given at birth in India, doesn\u2019t confer lifelong immunity. Whether the person still enjoys immunity from the vaccine or not can be determined using a skin test \u2014 PPD (purified protein derivative) test, or the Mantoux test, both reasonable options to the more expensive Igra (interferon gamma release assay) test. A positive test indicates a person still had BCGconferred immunity against TB.\n\nIf scientists can glean a valuable signal about the BCG-Covid-19 correlation using the PPD test, it could greatly aid policymakers faced with impossible trade-offs.\n\nhttps:\/\/economictimes.indiatimes.com\/industry\/healthcare\/biotech\/healthcare\/view-information-on-bcg-covid-connection-can-help-india-in-its-virus-fight\/articleshow\/75072677.cms?utm_source=contentofinterest&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=cppst","ea73eda6":"Das War's, Kaggle Notebook Runner: Mar\u00edlia Prata  @mpwolke ","f9555371":"#Codes from Chris X https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/docxian\/cord-19-dexamethasone-articles\/comments","28bd78d1":"kaggle.com"}}
