Recent research from (Lai, et al., 2019)[1] have shown that cross-lingual text classification have a huge domain gap between languages, even when using state-of-the-art pre-trained cross-lingual representations. One of the way to close this gap is by using UDA algorithm[2]. One of the technique used by [1] is using back-translated unlabeled data to train the model on its consistency loss.","1d686d31":"# Back-translate\nFor the back translation, I'm using English as the interim language.
