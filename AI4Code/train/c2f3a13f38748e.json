Good news: we have [several tracks on Kaggle Learn](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/learn\/overview) for just that purpose. The goal of this challenge is to quickly cover the fundamentals of the language - which will hopefully stand you in good stead whether you use Python for deep learning, data cleaning, or cheating at Scrabble.\n\nEach day of the Python Challenge will consist of two parts:\n- A **tutorial** notebook explaining Python concepts and showing example code. That's where you are now.\n- An [**exercise**](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/kernels\/fork\/969424) notebook with questions and coding problems to test your new knowledge.\n\nToday's tutorial includes a brief overview of Python syntax, variable assignment, and arithmetic operators. If you have previous Python experience, day 1 might not hold anything new for you, so feel free to [skip straight to the exercise](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/kernels\/fork\/969424).\n\n> These lessons borrow and adapt some content from [A Whirlwind Tour of Python](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/sohier\/whirlwind-tour-of-python-index).

Python offers a number of cheeky little time-saving tricks like this where operators like `*` and `+` have a different meaning depending on what kind of thing they're applied to. (The technical term for this is [operator overloading](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Operator_overloading))","97011f81":"It always gives us a `float`. \n\nThe `\/\/` operator gives us a result that's rounded down to the next integer.","0308dae2":"## Numbers and arithmetic in Python\n\nWe've already seen an example of a variable containing a number above:","e7d5539c":"Sometimes the default order of operations isn't what we want:","b8f52f0b":"# Hello, Python!\n\nPython was named for the British comedy troupe [Monty Python](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Monty_Python), so why not make our first Python program an homage to their famous [Spam](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Spam_(Monty_Python%29) skit?\n\n<!-- todo: maybe a little side note on spam metasyntactic variables in Python -->\n\nJust for fun, try reading over the code below and predicting what it's going to do when run. (If you have no idea, that's fine!)\n\nThen click the \"output\" button to see the results of our program.","cf38ef40":"### Builtin functions for working with numbers\n\n`min` and `max` return the minimum and maximum of their arguments, respectively...","f28bead1":"<hr>","05afaec9":"It's an `int` - short for integer. There's another sort of number we commonly encounter in Python:","12efd0c4":"\"Number\" is a fine informal name for the kind of thing, but if we wanted to be more technical, we could ask Python how it would describe the type of thing that `spam_amount` is:","14a9e677":"The first line above is a **comment**. In Python, comments begin with the `#` symbol.\n\nNext we see an example of reassignment. Reassigning the value of an existing variable looks just the same as creating a variable - it still uses the `=` assignment operator.\n\nIn this case, the value we're assigning to `spam_amount` involves a little simple arithmetic on its previous value. When it encounters this line, Python evaluates the expression on the right-hand-side of the `=` (0 + 4 = 4), and then assigns that value to the variable on the left-hand-side.","e2d3ff26":"Can you think of where this would be useful? You may see an example soon in the coding problems.","ebee434c":"A `float` is a number with a decimal place - very useful for representing things like weights or proportions.\n\n`type()` is the second built-in function we've seen (after `print()`), and it's another good one to remember. It's very useful to be able to ask Python \"what kind of thing is this?\". ","efdefbb4":"### Order of operations\n\nThe arithmetic we learned in primary school has conventions about the order in which operations are evaluated. Some remember these by a mnemonic such as **PEMDAS** - **P**arentheses, **E**xponents, **M**ultiplication\/**D**ivision, **A**ddition\/**S**ubtraction.\n\nPython follows similar rules about which calculations to perform first. They're mostly pretty intuitive.","17778c8d":"We won't talk much about conditionals until later, but, even if you've never coded before, you can probably guess what this does. Python is prized for its readability and the simplicity of its syntax (with some going as far as to call it \"executable pseudocode\"). \n\nNote how we indicated which code belongs to the `if`. `\"But I don't want ANY spam!\"` is only supposed to be printed if `spam_amount` is positive. But the later code (like `print(viking_song)`) should be executed no matter what. How do we (and Python) know that?\n\nThe colon (`:`) at the end of the `if` line indicates that a new \"code block\" is coming up. Subsequent lines which are **indented** (beginning with an extra 4 spaces) are part of that code block. You may be familiar with other languages which use `{`curly braces`}` to mark the beginning and end of code blocks. Python's use of meaningful whitespace often is surprising to programmers who are accustomed to other languages, but in practice it can lead to more consistent and readable code than languages that do not enforce indentation of code blocks. \n\nThe later lines dealing with `viking_song` are not indented with an extra 4 spaces, so they're not a part of the `if`'s code block. We'll see more examples of indented code blocks later when we start defining functions and using loops.\n\nThis code snippet is also our first sighting of a **string** in Python:\n\n```python\n\"But I don't want ANY spam!\"\n```\n\nStrings can be marked either by double or single quotation marks. (But because this particular string *contains* a single-quote character, we might confuse Python by trying to surround it with single-quotes, unless we're careful.)","273bc72f":"A natural thing to want to do with numbers is perform arithmetic. We've seen the `+` operator for addition, and the `*` operator for multiplication (of a sort).
