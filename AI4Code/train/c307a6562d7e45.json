This involves a few steps.\n\n### 1) Find the data\nBefore you can access the data, you need to find the table name with the data.\n\n*Hint*: Tab completion is helpful whenever you can't remember a command. Type `client.` and then hit the tab key. Don't forget the period before hitting tab.","9a34302f":"### 4) Dive slightly deeper\n\nYou'd like to take a closer look at rides from 2017.  Copy the query you used above in `rides_per_year_query` into the cell below for `rides_per_month_query`.  Then modify it in two ways:\n1.

Write a query that counts the number of trips in each year.  \n\nYour results should have two columns:\n- `year` - the year of the trips\n- `num_trips` - the number of trips in that year\n\nHints:\n- When using **GROUP BY** and **ORDER BY**, you should refer to the columns by the alias `year` that you set at the top of the **SELECT** query.\n- The SQL code to **SELECT** the year from `trip_start_timestamp` is <code>SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM trip_start_timestamp)<\/code>\n- The **FROM** field can be a little tricky until you are used to it.  The format is:\n    1. A backick (the symbol \\`).\n    2. The project name. In this case it is `bigquery-public-data`.\n    3. A period.\n    4. The dataset name.

Run the cell below to fetch the `chicago_taxi_trips` dataset.","dbfae898":"### 5) Write the query\n\nIt's time to step up the sophistication of your queries.  Write a query that shows, for each hour of the day in the dataset, the corresponding number of trips and average speed.\n\nYour results should have three columns:\n- `hour_of_day` - sort by this column, which holds the result of extracting the hour from `trip_start_timestamp`.\n- `num_trips` - the count of the total number of trips in each hour of the day (e.g. how many trips were started between 6AM and 7AM, independent of which day it occurred on).\n- `avg_mph` - the average speed, measured in miles per hour, for trips that started in that hour of the day.  Average speed in miles per hour is calculated as `3600 * SUM(trip_miles) \/ SUM(trip_seconds)`. (The value 3600 is used to convert from seconds to hours.)\n\nRestrict your query to data meeting the following criteria:\n- a `trip_start_timestamp` between **2017-01-01** and **2017-07-01**\n- `trip_seconds` > 0 and `trip_miles` > 0\n\nYou will use a common table expression (CTE) to select just the relevant rides.  Because this dataset is very big, this CTE should select only the columns you'll need to create the final output (though you won't actually create those in the CTE -- instead you'll create those in the later **SELECT** statement below the CTE).\n\nThis is a much harder query than anything you've written so far.  Good luck!"}}
