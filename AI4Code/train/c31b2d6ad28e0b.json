A. Clemmow\n\nPublished:31 January 1933  - https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1098\/rsta.1933.0008\n\nAbstract\n\n\"The differential equations arising in most branches of applied mathematics are linear equations of the second order. Internal ballistics, which is the dynamics of the motion of the shot in a gun, requires, except with the simplest assumptions, the discussion of non-linear differential equations of the first and second orders.\" \n\n\"The writer has shown in a previous paper how such non-linear equations arise when the pressure-index a in the rate-of-burning equation differs from unity, although only the simplified case of non-resisted motion was there considered. It is proposed in the present investigation to examine some cases of resisted motion taking the pressure-index equal to unity, to give some extensions of the previous work, and to consider, so far as is possible, the nature and the solution of the types of differential equations which arise.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/cirmath.hypotheses.org\/files\/2015\/01\/Mathematics-of-engineers-Dominique-Tourn%C3%A8s-S%C3%A9oul-ICM-2014-2.pdf","ad9e3012":"<h1><span class=\"label label-default\" style=\"background-color:black;border-radius:100px 100px; font-weight: bold; font-family:Garamond; font-size:20px; color:#03e8fc; padding:10px\">Ballistics during 18th and 19th centuries<\/span><\/h1><br>\n\nBallistics during 18th and 19th centuries: What kind of mathematics? By Dominique Tourn\u00e8s\n\n\"Newton was the first to research this topic taking into account the air resistance. In his Principia of 1687, he solved the problem with the hypothesis of a resistance proportional to the velocity, and he got quite rough approximations when the resistance is proportional to the square of the velocity.\"\n\n\"After Newton, Jean Bernoulli discovered the general solution in the case of a resistance proportional to any power of the velocity, but his solution, published in the Acta Eruditorum of 1719, was not convenient for numerical computation.\" \n\n\"In 1744, D\u2019Alembert restarts the problem of integrability of the equation. Acting here as a geometer, concerned only with progress of pure analysis, he finds four new cases of integrability. His work went relatively unnoticed at first: Legendre in 1782, and Jacobi in 1842 have found again certain of the same cases of integrability, but without quoting D\u2019Alembert.\"\n\n\"The question of integrability by quadratures of the ballistic equation is finally resolved in 1920 by Jules Drach, a brilliant mathematician who has contributed much in Galois theory of differential equations.\"\n\n\"Mathematicians, ballisticians and artillerymen, although part of different worlds, collaborated and inspired each other regularly. All that led however to a relative failure, both experimentally to find a good law of air resistance, and\nmathematically to find a simple solution of the ballistic differential equation.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/hal.univ-reunion.fr\/hal-01187210\/document","07d135d2":"After having tried other languages (C#, Cython) And new packages like ballistics, Pyballistics.
