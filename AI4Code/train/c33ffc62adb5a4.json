Random Predictions","22015de4":"In this kernel we take a deep dive into Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE). This is the metric used for the [ASHRAE Energy Prediction competition](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/ashrae-energy-prediction) and a common metric for regression problems. It is an extension on [Mean Squared Error (MSE)](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Root-mean-square_deviation) that is mainly used when predictions have large deviations, which is the case with this energy prediction competition. Values range from 0 up to millions and we don't want to punish deviations in prediction as much as with MSE.\n\nWe will explore the metric itself as well as some of the best naive predictions that are possible.\n\nP.S. This kernel is the first in a series of kernels on competition metrics. Feel free to check out [\"Episode Two\" of Understanding the metric on Quadratic Weighted Kappa](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/carlolepelaars\/understanding-the-metric-quadratic-weighted-kappa) and [\"Episode Three\" of Understanding the metric on Spearman's Rho](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/carlolepelaars\/understanding-the-metric-spearman-s-rho).","f2cbb95e":"## Table Of Contents","2d33e528":"Making a constant prediction is a good way to get a sense of what it means to have good performance on model. You can build a complex model that can get 95% accuracy, but if a constant prediction will give you that as well than 95% doesn't look so good anymore. A metric like [AUC (Area under ROC Curve)](https:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/generated\/sklearn.metrics.roc_auc_score.html) will for example give a more honest representation for constant predictions, which is 0.5 and the same for random predictions.\n\nThe best constant score for RMSLE is the exponential of the mean of the log target values. It can be expressed as a formula in the following way.\n\n#### Best constant for RMSLE = $\\mathrm{e}^{mean(log_e(targets))}$\n\nWe will derive this conclusion for ourselves by iteratively increasing the constant value and checking where the RMSLE score is the lowest.","788ff424":"In the graph above we can see that the RMSLE score is the lowest around 60.
