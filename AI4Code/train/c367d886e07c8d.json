Abstract\n\nInterestingly, it's a very interesting phenomenon that global transformation by a the Moon's tide stress seems to be a trigger of occurrence for a disastrous earthquake (M>=5.5).\n\nIt is found out that some statistically considered research papers geared to past earthquakes, there is no one which show about Lunar Age or Lunar Phase Angle clearly.The one of possibility reason is tidal phase angle on the Earth depends on the lunar age. However, many people can not calculate the tidal phase angle. \n\nThis report's objective is that many people are able to imagine at time of high potential of earthquake occurrence intuitively by using visualization of **the position of the Moon and the Sun when earthquake was occurred**. \n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nSchuster (1987) [1] is first article which discuss the influence of the tide from the moon.\nSome Studies, such as Tanaka (2012) [2] and Ide et al. (2016) [3], are studied the relationship between the earth tides and earthquakes with targeting specific seismic sources (groups). \nTsuruoka and Ohtake (1995) [4] discussed the relationship with the global tides for earthquakes that occurred in the world. \nHowever, it is too difficult to calclulate tidal stress and to understand it for non-academia ordinary people.\nTherefore, I show some figures of relationship between earthquakes and lunar age in order to imagine the timing of earthquake occurrence. \n\n## 2. Data\n\n## 2.1 Data Source\n\nI selected the \"[Significant Earthquakes, 1965-2016](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/usgs\/earthquake-database)\" as the earthquake catalog to visualize target which is probably presented by USGS (United States Geological Survey) on Kaggle platform.\n\nSome earthquake catalogs (or past event lists) are opend on official sites of public organizations, such as USGS, Meteorological Institute of Japan, Disaster-Reduction Research of Japan. These catalogs are not useful because it is not simple list. \n\nAlmost earthquakes are caused by plate tectonics at each location, regional characteristics exists. This article target for wide-area seismic activity on the whole earth, regional characteristics are not considered at all. Because it makes hard to discuss the actual mechanism of earthquake occurrence, this may be cause a feeling of strangeness to researcher.\n\n## 2.2 Data Overview\n\nLet's confirm a few head data after reading catalog. ","4d620d6e":"Tidal force is maximized at the phase angle is 0 or 180 deg, however, the influence from the moon and the Sun on the Earth's surface layer cannot be ignored due to the movement of the ocean, and the Earth's behavior as elastic body. It means that tidal effect delays about 0 - 8 hours from tidal force change. \n","cc46b86c":"At least, this figure indicates followings:\n\n* Phase angle between the Sun and the Moon impacts each position (latitude) differently\n* There are seismic sources which easily are influenced by the phase angle\n\n### 4.3 Phase Angle and the Distance\n\nRelationship between Magnitude and Distances of the Sun and the Moon.","5dae5084":"### 3.3 Obtaining of Phase Angle between the Sun and the Moon\n\nWe need to determine lunar age in order to obtain the day of Full Moon and New Moon because tidal force become the storongest at Full Moon or New Moon. When the Moon is new, the direction from the Earth to the Moon coincides with to the Sun, and each gravity force vectors faces in the same direction. When the Moon is full,  both the directions and gravity force vectors are in an opposite way. \n\n![Reference: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tide](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/d\/d5\/Tide_schematic.svg\/1280px-Tide_schematic.svg.png)\n\nThee angle between the Moon and the Sun is defined as [Phase Angle](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Phase_angle_(astronomy)) as following figure. \n\n![](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/boomin.yokohama\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Phase_Angle_min.jpg?w=640&ssl=1)\n","306d7b5d":"**However, this may be misinformation** because this distribution is almost the same as the one of the Earth-Month distance in the lunar orbit.\n\nUpper fugure shows that there is no dependency of the distance to the Moon. \nLunar tidal stress affects by gain of amplitude of tidal stress, not magnitude of force (Tsuruoka and Ohtake (1995)[4], Elizabeth et al. (2014)[5]). \nIt is safe to say that there facts are consistant. ","fa4eb798":"We notice following facts: \n\n* concentlating in shallower area than 100km\n* there is also a concentlated areas between 550km and 650km\n\nWe are not able to confirm from this figure, epicenters of the earthquakes which are occureed below 550km depth may be locate at center area of continental, not at plate boundary. \n\nThe depth of seismic source due to tidal stress or ocean tide is approximately 70-80 km, considering the occuerrence mechanism. \nFrom now on, **we use the data shallower than 80km to visualize**.","0a0ea7b9":"There are some peaks, such as at -10 deg or 50 deg, however distribution of latitude depends on the location of plate boundary. \nThis figure do not show the correlation between the tidal stress from the Moon and occuracy of earthquake. \nThis is described later in [section 4.2](#4.2-Relationship-between-the-epicenter-and-Phase-Angle).

This is the primary mechanism that drives tidal action and explains two equipotential tidal bulges, accounting for two daily high waters.\n\n![](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/e\/eb\/Tide_overview.svg\/410px-Tide_overview.svg.png)\n\n(Reference: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tide)\n\n\nIf it is strongly affected by tidal stress from the Moon, it is expected that many earthquakes will occur at the time when the Moon goes south or after 12 hours (opposite) from it.\nHowever, the time taken for the wave to travel around the ocean also means that there is a delay between the phases of the Moon and their effect on the tide.\n\nDistribution of azimuth of the Moon when earthquake is occurred is shown following. \n","ef477d80":"There are two peaks at 90deg (East:moonrise) and 270deg (West:moonset), and it does not seem that there is no difference between Magnitudes. \n\nTidal stress itself has a local maximum at culmination of the Moon (azimuth:180deg), the change rate per unit time (speed of change) is local minimal at the time. \nThe change rate is delayed 90deg (about 6 hours: this means that if you differentiate sin, it becomes cos). \nIn addition, depending on the location, ocean sea level changes due to tides are delayed by approximately 0-8 hours.\n\nThese phenomena are consistent with upper figures. \nHowever, it is difficult because the azimuth of the Moon is depended on Latitude. \nTherefore, distribution of azimuth with some phase angles are shown as follow:","0395eaa7":"The culmination altitude (the highest altitude) of thde Moon is depend on observater's latitude. \nThis means that vertical axis of this figure makes the sense that the relative value is more important.\n\nIt can be confirmed that the distribution with altitude around 0 degrees, \nand the phase angle close to 0 degrees or 180 degrees in the above figure is larger than the distribution of the phase angle near 90 degrees. \nThis is consistent with the discussed about azimuth distribution in section 4.4.\n\nIt's to be noted that a fault orientation is one of key point to consider, \nI should also focus on each region under ordinary circumstances.\n\n### 4.6 Seasonal Trend\n\nEarthquake occurrence frequency of each month are shown as following. \nMany earthquakes in March 2011 were occurred by Tohoku\u2010Oki earthquake (Mw 9.1) in Japan, I devide the dataset 2011 and except 2011. \n","11dd113e":"The mean and standard deviation of daily occurrence of earthquake of dataset except 2011 is calculated as 1.164 and 0.040, respectively. \nIt seems to conclude that there is no seasonal variation since the 2$\\sigma$ range is not exceeded for all months.\n\nIt is also important to remember that some article point out regional characteristic features (Heki, 2003)[6]). \nThis indicates that a specific seismic source or fault may have strongly seasonal variation. \n","a691d069":"It seems that data points are concentrated about 0.97 and 1.05 in distance. \nIt's checked distance dependency respectively about Phase Angle and Magnitude.\n","61fbc351":"When azimuths are 90deg and 270deg, it means the Full Moon and a New Moon, the earthquake occur more frequently. \nThis means that you should pay attention at moonrise and moonset. \n\n### 4.5 Distribution of Moon's Altitude\n\nLet's confirm the relationship between Lunar Altitude and Phase Angle. \n"}}
