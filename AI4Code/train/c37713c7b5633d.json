However, I don't think that p = 17 is likely to make much sense here because, theoretically, this would imply that the GDP value of 17 years ago has a significant influence on the current GDP value. I'm not saying this is impossible, but I think it's more reasonable to work with a simpler model. So I'll only consider that p could be equal to 1 and to 4.","6945e711":"The residuals are not normally distributed and we can see that the closer they get to the fifthies the greater they become. This suggests us that we should be careful when using this model to make forecasts. A good improvement to this model could be the use of exogenous variables (transforming this ARIMA model into an ARIMAX model). However I'm not going into this step here, because this would surpass the purpose of this notebook. ","4e9ec4a8":"<h2>The ARIMA Model<\/h2>\n\nThe ARIMA Model is composed of three parameters: p, d, and q.\n- p regards the number of lagged dependent variables in the model; It is expressed as AR(p);\n- d is the number of times the series has to be differentiated to become stationary;\n- q is the number of lagged errors terms in the regression that are influencing the current value of the dependent variable; It is commonly expressed as MA(q).","a5f8b1b1":"Ok. So we have three columns: the first one with the year, the second with the GDP and the third one with NaN values. \n\nI'll rename the first and second columns, filter the dataset to work only with the years previous to the fifthies, and I'll drop the third column.","b8af0a85":"<h2>Forecasting the 1950's Brazilian GDP<\/h2>\n\nLet's close this notebook by comparing this ARIMA model forecasts to the real Brazilian GDP values. And let's see how good it is to predict the next ten years of GDP growth.","5ff4e774":"Since I'm working with the GDP I'm creating the variable _GDP_Change_ to help us see the yearly percentual change in GDP.","8f79d513":"<h2>Initial Visualization<\/h2>\n\nLet's plot the data and see the yearly Brazilian GDP and its rate of change.","c3df7066":"Great.

The smaller their values, the better the model is.","dc27dbe2":"Now I'll try to identificate _p_ and _q_ by plotting the **Partial Autocorrelation** and the **Autocorrelation** functions.\n\nThe main idea here is to identificate the points outside the confidence interval as possible values for _p_ and _q_.

This is not a surprise since the model residuals get larger as we reach the end of the time series. Adding exogenous variables to the model and transforming it in an ARIMAX model could certainly help to improve it.
