In this notebook, I am sharing a simple usage of datatable.\n\n**October TPS Dataset Load Time**\n1. Datatable - ~25 secs\n2. Pandas - ~90 secs\n\nOne advantage I see with datatable is that we can convert the datatable dataframe into pandas dataframe and continue to have fun with pandas as we all are familiar with. This decreases the learning curve to adapt a completely new library to handle data.\n\nFeel free to upvote and share the notebook if you find it helpful."}}
