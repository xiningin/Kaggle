So the ANN can be seen as matrix multiplications (with bias addition) where the matrix is the parameter that we need to estimate (toghether with the bias).\n\nLet's take the MSE as the loss function and the sigmoid function as the activation (it's derivative is pretty easy :D), given the true value $y$ and the prediction $\\hat{y}$ (output of the final layer, so if we have L layers $\\hat y = a_L$) we have:\n\n\\begin{align}\nL(y,\\hat{y}) &= (\\hat y - y)^2\n\\end{align}\n\nWe need to minimize the Loss Function, so let's calculate the derivative of the Loss function:\n\\begin{align}\n\\dfrac{\\partial L(y,\\hat y)}{\\partial W_L} &= \\text{Using the chain Rule} \\\\\n                                     &= \\dfrac{\\partial L(y,\\hat y)}{\\partial \\hat y} \\dfrac{\\partial \\hat y}{\\partial z_L} \\dfrac{\\partial z_L}{\\partial W_L} \n\\end{align}\nNow let's compute each one of them:\n\\begin{align}\n\\dfrac{\\partial L(y,\\hat y)}{\\partial \\hat y} &= \\dfrac{\\partial (\\hat y - y)^2}{\\partial \\hat y} = 2(\\hat y - y) \\\\\n\\dfrac{\\partial \\hat y}{\\partial z_L} &= \\sigma'(z_L) = \\sigma(z_L)(1-\\sigma(z_L)) \\text{ if $\\sigma$ is the sigmoid function}\\\\\n\\dfrac{\\partial z_L}{\\partial W_L} &= \\dfrac{\\partial (W_L a_{L-1} + b_L)}{\\partial W_L} = a_{L-1} \n\\end{align}\nWhile for the precedent layer it becomes nesting the derivative even more:\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\dfrac{\\partial L(y,\\hat y)}{\\partial W_{L-1}} &= \\dfrac{\\partial L(y,\\hat y)}{\\partial \\hat y} \\dfrac{\\partial \\hat y}{\\partial z_L} \\dfrac{\\partial z_L}{\\partial a_{L-1}} \\dfrac{\\partial a_{L-1}}{\\partial z_{L-1}} \\dfrac{\\partial z_{L-1}}{\\partial W_{L-1}} \\\\\n        &= 2(\\hat y - y)\\sigma(z_L)(1-\\sigma(z_L))W_L\\sigma(z_{L-1})(1-\\sigma(z_{L-1}))a_{L-2}\n\\end{align}","83c723a9":"The Paper I just mentioned explains, the actual reason of their perfomance, let $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ a single layer perceptron can be seen as:\n\\begin{align}\ny = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\alpha_i \\sigma(y_i^Tx + \\theta_i) \\label{eq1}\\tag{eq. 1}\n\\end{align}\n\nwhere $\\sigma$ is a sigmoidical function, which mean that \n$$\\sigma(t) = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{for} & t \\to +\\infty  \\\\ 0 & \\text{for} & t \\to -\\infty \\end{cases}$$\nit basically represents the activation function you use today in the Neural Networks.\nAnd then the paper proofs basically how a function of the form (\\ref{eq1}) can approximate any given continuous function (or atleast with a finite integral value of the absolute function) in a compact subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^n$.\n\nThis explains why the MLP works well, they can approximate mostly any given function, the problem is using only one layer the search space is very big, so you need to find the perfect parameters to fit the function, while using more layers, the (\\ref{eq1}) becomes nested since x is recieved not from the input but from a previous layer, this way it can approximate even more complex function very easily and rapidly, of course there is a trade off, adding more layer you increase the number of parameters, which in result might overfit the data, so the number of layer becomes a hyper parameter to be optimized.\n\nThere are a few hypthosis that the MLP makes, first of all, it assumes that the function which connects output to the input actually exists, so if you see that the ANN are not working well, it might be because the input are not actually explaining the output, and one more thing since we are trying to approximate a global function the training data must be as representative as possible of the whole population.","630c5397":"<center><h2>\nThe creation of this notebook required a lot of time and dedication, please UPVOTE if you find it useful.\n<\/h2><\/center>\nAnd of course if there is something you find confusing or wrong don't hestitate to comment :)\n\nFor future if people like this notebook, I would love to explain also Gradient Descendent and other non linear optimization techniques with code, may be not on the NN backpropagation but with actual functions so it's easier to animate etc."}}
