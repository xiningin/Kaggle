I built it outta stuff I found in the garage.\\nRick:Morty. I had to... I had to do it. I had\u2014 I had to\u2014 I had to make a bomb, Morty. I had to create a bomb.\\nMorty:What?! A bomb?!\\nRick:We\\'re gonna drop it down there just get a whole fresh start, Morty.

What is this place?\\nRick:It\\'s Dimension 35-C, and it\\'s got the perfect climate conditions for a this Mega Tree, and there\\'s fruit in those trees, and there\\'s seeds in those fruits. I\\'m talking about Mega Seeds. They\\'re they\\'re incredibly powerful, and I need them to help me with my research, Morty.\\nMorty:ok whatever you say!\\nRick:They\\'re just robots, Morty! It\\'s okay to shoot them! They\\'re robots!\\nMorty:They\\'re not robots, Rick!\\nRick:It\\'s a figure of speech, Morty. They\\'re bureaucrats. I don\\'t respect them. Just keep shooting, Morty.

You\\'re gonna be fine!\\nMorty:Woahh!\\nRick:ooo... Watch out for that stuff. It\\'ll stain if it gets on your clothes, and it\\'ll send into a murderous rage if it gets in your eyes or mouth.\\nRick:I know this isn\\'t the time, but, you know, technically the second freezer drawer is mine.\\nMorty:You\\'re overreacting!\\nRick:What? Every hospital claims to have the best doctor in the galaxy. It\\'s like those pizza places that claim to have the best pizza in the world. What- Do you think they have pizza contests? Have you ever been to a pizza contest?\\nRick:Fine!  Excuse me. Coming through. What are you here for- Just kidding, I don\\'t care. Well this won\\'t do.\\nRick:Yeah me neither, we pretty much nailed it the first time.\\nMorty:And how are you gonna do that?\\nRick:You gotta be careful Morty, if that guy catches you with a box of his eye-holes he comes bursting in through a window and just starts kicking the shit outta you.

Oh man, Beth is, is Jerry fifity!?\\nRick:Time to go another dream deep, Morty!\\nMorty:What the hell? Why would Mr. Morty\\'s dream version of Jessica\\nRick:Listen, Morty, I hate to break it to you, but what people call \\\"love\\\" is a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed. It hits hard, Morty, then it slowly fades, leaving you stranded in a failing marriage. I did it, your parents are gonna do it. Break the cycle, Morty. Rise above.

You just babble about defense budgets and the United Nations, and then you pass out!\\nRick:So, to be clear, I sometimes reference the geopolitical complexities of the topic, which is not the same as going to an anti-Semitic place.\\nMorty:ok thank you.\\nRick:ok.'\n\n    ","5942cb7b":"'''prompt=newtext\nt=True\nwhile t:\n    person=str(input('Morty:'))\n    prompt+='Morty:'+person+'\\n'\n    prompt+='Rick:'\n    output=model(prompt)\n    prompt+=output+'\\n'\n    print('Rick:',output)\n    if person=='bey':\n        print('Rick:ok I\\'m done, go away')\n        t=False'''\n","8784a6c1":"---------\neven though rick don't belive in love the model says he believes in love!","a8fcfbcf":"so the model takes a text and completes it so we make starting of a conversation and let the model finish it,for eg we make like this:\n\nperson1:hello,how are you?\nperson2:I'm fine thank you,and you?\nperson1:\n\nif we feed this to GPT-3 model it somehow finish that line (and maybe what person2 says next also)\n\nwe just sum up first 100 dialogue between rick and morty and feed that to model then in a while loop we take input from the user(in this case we pretending we are morty) and put that text as last line of that 100 dialogue text and put this to model, so the model gives output as it is rick, then we add that line to that 101 line text and we continue as morty and the loop goes on.","dbe5ffd2":"-----------------\nwe can see this one includes relevant information like elon musk's rocket and all,this model is pretty powerful!","c5a7597d":"-------------------\nanother one:\n\nMorty: hey rick\n\nRick: I\u2019m-I\u2019m not gonna to pick up the phone, \n\nMorty: why\n\nRick: Because I\u2019m not gonna pick up the phone, that\u2019s why.\n\nMorty: oh cool\n\nRick: What?
