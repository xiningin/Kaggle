style=\"background-color:#1D0B85;\"><center><span style=\"font-family:Georgia;\"><span style=\"color:white\">Factors affecting Water Potability is listed below.<\/span><\/span><\/center><\/div>\n\n<span style=\"font-family:Georgia;\"><b>1. pH :-<\/b> The pH of water is an important metric in determining its acid\u2013base balance. It can also be used to determine if the water is acidic or alkaline. The pH maximum allowable limit has been set at 6.5 to 8.5 by the WHO. The current investigation ranged from 6.52 to 6.83, which is within WHO guidelines.<\/span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family:Georgia;\"><b>2. Hardness :-<\/b> Calcium and magnesium salts are the main causes of hardness. These salts are dissolved in water as it passes through geologic layers. The length of time water spends in contact with hardness-producing material influences the amount of hardness in raw water. The capacity of water to precipitate soap produced by Calcium and Magnesium was formerly termed as hardness.<\/span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family:Georgia;\"><b>3. Solids :-<\/b> Potassium, calcium, sodium, bicarbonates, chlorides, magnesium, sulphates, and other inorganic and organic minerals or salts can all be dissolved in water. These minerals gave the water an unpleasant taste and a diluted tint. This is an important criterion for water usage. The presence of a high TDS value in water suggests that it is heavily mineralized. Desirable limit for TDS is 500 mg\/l and maximum limit is 1000 mg\/l which prescribed for drinking purpose.<\/span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family:Georgia;\"><b>4. Chloramines :-<\/b> The main disinfectants used in public water systems are chlorine and chloramine. When ammonia is added to chlorine to purify drinking water, chloramines are generated. Chlorine levels in drinking water up to 4 milligrammes per litre (mg\/L or 4 parts per million (ppm)) are deemed safe.<\/span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family:Georgia;\"><b>5. Sulfate :-<\/b> Minerals, soil, and rocks all include sulphates, which are naturally occurring compounds. They can be found in the environment, groundwater, plants, and food. Sulfate's main commercial application is in the chemical industry. Seawater contains roughly 2,700 milligrammes per litre (mg\/L) of sulphate. Most freshwater supplies have concentrations of 3 to 30 mg\/L, while some geographic regions have significantly greater quantities (1000 mg\/L).<\/span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family:Georgia;\"><b>6. Conductivity :-<\/b> Pure water is a good insulator rather than a good conductor of electric current. The electrical conductivity of water improves as ions concentration rises. The electrical conductivity of water is usually determined by the amount of dissolved particles in it. Electrical conductivity (EC) is a measurement of a solution's ionic process, which allows it to transmit current. <\/span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family:Georgia;\"> <b>7. Organic_carbon :-<\/b> Total Organic Carbon (TOC) in source waters comes from decaying natural organic matter (NOM) as well as synthetic sources. TOC is a measure of the total amount of carbon in organic compounds in pure water. <\/span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family:Georgia;\"><b>8. Trihalomethanes :-<\/b> THMs are compounds that can be found in chlorine-treated water. THM levels in drinking water vary depending on the amount of organic matter in the water, the amount of chlorine needed to treat the water, and the temperature of the water being treated. THM levels in drinking water up to 80 ppm are deemed safe.<\/span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family:Georgia;\"><b>9. Turbidity :-<\/b> The amount of solid stuff in the suspended state determines the turbidity of water. It is a test that determines the quality of waste discharge in terms of colloidal matter by measuring the light emitting properties of water. Wondo Genet Campus's mean turbidity value (0.98 NTU) is lower than the WHO's recommended value of 5.00 NTU.<\/span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family:Georgia;\"><b>10. Potability :-<\/b> Indicates whether or not water is fit for human consumption, with 1 denoting drinkable and 0 denoting unfit for human consumption.<\/span>","6042625f":"<span style=\"font-family:Georgia;\"><b>Hardness<\/b> is a factor affecting pH of water. Scientists measure the hardness of water using a pH scale, which measures the hydrogen-ion concentration in the liquid. Water with a low pH is more acidic, while water with a higher pH is harder or more alkaline, meaning it is able to neutralize acids. <\/span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family:Georgia;\"><b>pH<\/b> of water determines the <b>potability<\/b> of water.<\/span>","8f3caf02":"<span style=\"font-family:Georgia;\"><b>Potable water<\/b>, commonly known as drinking water, is obtained from surface and underground sources and is treated to fulfil state and federal drinking water requirements. Microorganisms, bacteria, harmful compounds, viruses, and faeces are all removed from natural water sources. Drinking untreated, raw water can lead to gastrointestinal issues like diarrhoea, vomiting, and fever.<\/span>","e2825bda":"<div align='center'>\n    <img src='https:\/\/i.gifer.com\/1ptX.gif'>\n<\/div>","bd49df5e":"\n<div style=\"background-color:#1D0B85;\">\n    <h><span style=\"font-size:50px;\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia;\"><span style=\"color:white\"><center><b>Water Potability<\/b><\/center><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/h>\n<\/div>","504187fb":"## <div style=\"background-color:#1D0B85;\"><center><span style=\"font-family:Georgia;\"><span style=\"color:white\">Data Preprocessing<\/span><\/span><\/center><\/div>","714f2ff2":"## <div style=\"background-color:#1D0B85;\"><center><span style=\"font-family:Georgia;\"><span style=\"color:white\">Feature Engineering<\/span><\/span><\/center><\/div>","59455b3f":"## <center><span style=\"font-family:cursive;\"><span style=\"color:blue\">The End<\/span><\/span><\/center>","74b8fdbb":"<span style=\"font-family:Georgia;\"><b>Water hardness is classified by the U.S. Department of Interior and the Water Quality Association as follows:<\/b><\/span>\n\n<table class=\"center\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Classificationr<\/th>\n    <th>mg\/l or ppm<\/th>\n  <\/tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Soft<\/td>\n    <td>0 - 17.1<\/td>\n  <\/tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Slightly hard<\/td>\n    <td>17.1 - 60<\/td>\n  <\/tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Moderately hard<\/td>\n    <td>60 - 120<\/td>\n  <\/tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Hard<\/td>\n    <td>120 - 180<\/td>\n  <\/tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Very Hard<\/td>\n    <td>180 & over<\/td>\n  <\/tr>  \n<\/table>","0954b4fb":"<span style=\"font-family:Georgia;\">The presence of <b>sulfate<\/b> in drinking-water result in a noticeable taste.
