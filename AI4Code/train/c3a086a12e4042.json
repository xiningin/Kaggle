Unfortunately, there weren\u2019t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\n\nWhile there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\n\nIn this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: \u201cwhat sorts of people were more likely to survive?\u201d using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).","f672ff27":"Since probablity of a male person surviving is so less and probablity of a female person surviving is so great just by predicting all males will die and all females will live we can solve this problem to an good accuracy. In fact this solution is enough get you a score of 0.76 in this contest","7f60e356":"From this we can notice a few traits being a child of class-1 or class-2 type or being a female of class-1 or class-2 type normally increases the probablity of survival by a lot. \n\nThis is because these were the people who got evacuated in the limited number of lifeboats that the Titanic had.","03209ac0":"### **But Let's us not stop here**\n\nLet's try to get some more sense of the data. \nThis time let us transform 'Age' to 'Age-Group'\n* Child - Age<14\n* Adult - Age>=14","2929be04":"**First Step:** \nGet your data into python.","3db4b1e2":"**Inspect your data to find out more about it's structure.**","ff42580b":"Again we can easily observe that children have high probablity of surviving while those whose age is not available to us have very low probablity of survival.\n\nSimilarly we can do the same exercise for Passenger-Class and draw a graph of survival which will show us which traits lead to survival in the Titanic.","d4399d12":"Here is an interesting result that we can see from this data, let me put it in form of probablity to make it even more clear."}}
