The concept is that we will train two models at the same time: a generator and a critic. The generator will try to make new images similar to the ones in our dataset, and the critic will try to classify real images from the ones the generator does. The generator returns images, the critic a single number (usually 0. for fake images and 1. for real ones).\n\nWe train them against each other in the sense that at each step (more or less), we:\n1. Freeze the generator and train the critic for one step by:\n  - getting one batch of true images (let's call that `real`)\n  - generating one batch of fake images (let's call that `fake`)\n  - have the critic evaluate each batch and compute a loss function from that; the important part is that it rewards positively the detection of real images and penalizes the fake ones\n  - update the weights of the critic with the gradients of this loss\n  \n  \n2.

We don't create a validation set here for reasons we'll explain later. It consists of random noise of size 100 by default (can be changed below) as inputs and the images of bedrooms as targets. That's why we do `tfm_y=True` in the transforms, then apply the normalization to the ys and not the xs."}}
