In logistic regression, the dependent variable is a binary variable that contains data coded as 1 (yes, success, etc.) or 0 (no, failure, etc.). \n\nIn other words, the logistic regression model predicts P(Y=1) as a function of X.\n\n\nLogistic Regression Assumptions\nBinary logistic regression requires the dependent variable to be binary.\nFor a binary regression, the factor level 1 of the dependent variable should represent the desired outcome.\nOnly the meaningful variables should be included.\nThe independent variables should be independent of each other. That is, the model should have little or no multicollinearity.\nThe independent variables are linearly related to the log odds.\nLogistic regression requires quite large sample sizes."}}
