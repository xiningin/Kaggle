We will start using some \"black boxes\" such as random forests that haven't yet been explained in detail, and then we'll dig into the lower level details later.\n\nTo start, focus on what things DO, not what they ARE.","1c390738":"In any sort of data science work, it's **important to look at your data**, to make sure you understand the format, how it's stored, what type of values it holds, etc. Even if you've read descriptions about your data, the actual data may not be what you expect.","f0e2af6d":"### ...our approach to machine learning","be682f39":"The shape of this curve suggests that adding more trees isn't going to help us much.
