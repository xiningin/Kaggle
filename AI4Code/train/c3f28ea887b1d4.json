The summary is represented in a tabular form.\n\n\nFour types of outcomes are possible while evaluating a classification model performance. These four outcomes are described below:-\n\n\n**True Positives (TP)** \u2013 True Positives occur when we predict an observation belongs to a certain class and the observation actually belongs to that class.\n\n\n**True Negatives (TN)** \u2013 True Negatives occur when we predict an observation does not belong to a certain class and the observation actually does not belong to that class.\n\n\n**False Positives (FP)** \u2013 False Positives occur when we predict an observation belongs to a    certain class but the observation actually does not belong to that class. This type of error is called **Type I error.**\n\n\n\n**False Negatives (FN)** \u2013 False Negatives occur when we predict an observation does not belong to a certain class but the observation actually belongs to that class.
