Problem statement\n\nIn the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition.\n\nFor many incumbent operators, retaining high profitable customers is the number one business\ngoal. To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn. In this project, you will analyze customer-level data of a leading telecom firm, build predictive models to identify customers at high risk of churn, and identify the main indicators of churn.\n\nIn this competition, your goal is *to build a machine learning model that is able to predict churning customers based on the features provided for their usage.*\n\n**Customer behaviour during churn:**\n\nCustomers usually do not decide to switch to another competitor instantly, but rather over a\nperiod of time (this is especially applicable to high-value customers). In churn prediction, we\nassume that there are three phases of customer lifecycle :\n\n1. <u>The \u2018good\u2019 phase:<\/u> In this phase, the customer is happy with the service and behaves as usual.\n\n2. <u>The \u2018action\u2019 phase:<\/u> The customer experience starts to sore in this phase, for e.g. he\/she gets a compelling offer from a competitor, faces unjust charges, becomes unhappy with service quality etc. In this phase, the customer usually shows different behaviour than the \u2018good\u2019 months. It is crucial to identify high-churn-risk customers in this phase, since some corrective actions can be taken at this point (such as matching the competitor\u2019s offer\/improving the service quality etc.)\n\n3. <u>The \u2018churn\u2019 phase:<\/u> In this phase, the customer is said to have churned. In this case, since you are working over a four-month window, the first two months are the \u2018good\u2019 phase, the third month is the \u2018action\u2019 phase, while the fourth month (September) is the \u2018churn\u2019 phase.","ba845b48":"Splitting train and test data to avoid any contamination of the test data","f0e6505c":"# 1.
