It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.Seaborn helps you explore and understand your data. Its plotting functions operate on dataframes and arrays containing whole datasets and internally perform the necessary semantic mapping and statistical aggregation to produce informative plots. Its dataset-oriented, declarative API lets you focus on what the different elements of your plots mean, rather than on the details of how to draw them.\nyou can check [seaborn.pydata.org](http:\/\/) for more information","3031d375":"**the result of this plot is that maximum number of babies was for January**","cabb8386":"**this plot shows distribution of stays in week nights through the months and it show maximum distribution is for january**","4fb57b81":"**it shows different kind of reservations through the lead time and shows which parking spaces they reserved**","b754c9b9":"**Question5:deleting \"company\" column**","ec530f95":"**Question9:average of stays in the week.**","c1143105":"**Question2: basic information**","e9aa8dc1":"# Let's visualize the data","f97d7075":"**Question10:name and email address of people who had the 5 \"special request\"**","014b23dc":"**Question12:who has the most \"babies\" & \"children\"**","30646c44":"**this plot shows the distribution of the companies** ","02d559aa":"**this plot shows how many customers were in which types of room through the weeks**","97282c01":"**Question6:which countries have the most passenger in this hotel?
