Consider the `csv` package.\n- I don't recommend using sklearn if you're going for the extra credit - deep learning is much more powerful.","0b973afb":"That's... okay, considering there are six classes total, making the random accuracy score 16.67%. Still, I wonder if another classifier would perform better... :)\n\nThis concludes our introduction to scikit-learn. This should be more than enough to get you started on HW7 P5, even if you've never used this package before.","2e445176":"That looks much better, but we still don't know how well the classifier is really doing. We do have the ground truth for the test set, so now we can calculate the *classification accuracy*, that is, the percentage of items that were correctly classified. Of course, sklearn has a function for that.","6d781671":"# Data Setup\nThis section of the homework may not be worth any points, but it is the most important. Data saving and data processing are often the most time-consuming, and if done incorrectly, will result in incorrect results for all classifiers.\n\nInstead of tic-tac-toe (which is your assignment), we're going to look at the Glass Identification Data Set [1], originally distributed through the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https:\/\/archive.ics.uci.edu\/ml\/datasets\/glass+identification) but also accessible through [OpenML](https:\/\/www.openml.org\/d\/41).\n\nBefore we jump into importing, we should first understand what this dataset actually is. In the description:\n> The study of classification of types of glass was motivated by criminological investigation. At the scene of the crime, the glass left can be used as evidence...if it is correctly identified!\n\nCool! We also see that each data point has 9 *numeric* features. RI, the refractive index, and 8 elements (unit: weight percent in corresponding oxide, presumably measured with X-ray fluorescence). *hint: for tic-tac-toe, notice that all features are nominal, not numeric. Some classifiers don't like this; you probably want to look for a [LabelEncoder](https:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/generated\/sklearn.preprocessing.LabelEncoder.html).*\n\nWe see that there are 214 items total. Finally, we see that we're trying to classify each item into one of six classes: \n1. build wind float\n2. build wind non-float\n3. vehic wind float\n4. vehic wind non-float (NO SAMPLES PROVIDED)\n5. containers\n6. tableware\n7. headlamps\n\nGreat, now we can jump in to actually importing the data. I recommend you do this for the tic-tac-toe dataset also before jumping in.\n\n[1] Evett, Ian W., and Ernest J.
