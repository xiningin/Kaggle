Introduction\n\n<i>Welcome to my first Kaggle Notebook. The purpose of this notebook is to learn so it isn't perfect (nor complete) and welcomes you to leave feedback! :)<\/i> <br> <br>\nI chose to work with this dataset because I found some interesting themes in the survey questions and believe an in-depth analysis can reveal some insights about the relationship between mental health and our workplace. While I have not yet finalized that analysis, I found that the survey questions can be grouped into three insightful categories: \n1. Workplace logistics re mental health support (eg do you have mental health benefits from your employer) \n2. Perceptions of mental health (eg would you be willing to bring up mental healh in x context) and \n3. Personal experience with mental health (eg have you been diagnosed with a mental health disorder).\n\nI would ultimately like to compare workplace support with perceptions of mental health to see if increased support will increase employee willingness to address mental health issues. If so, one could advise tech companies to talk more about mental health if they wish to ultimately foster a more equitable work environment for tech industry impoyees with (and without) mental health disorders. \n\nThis notebook combines the 2017 and 2018 survey data but omits the 2014 and 2016 data because the previous two years' questions were entirely different. \n","da129b84":"<hr style=\"height:2px; border:none; color:black; background-color:black;\">","c0022e3f":"## 1.3 Comprehensive Cleaning","32f2fb79":"## 1.1 Import Datasets","d7441252":"# Outline\n## I.
