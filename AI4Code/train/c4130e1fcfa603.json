Since the results were determinative, it was decided to perform the t test. If the result of Normality Assumption method was not determinative, the mannwhitneyu test (non-parametric test) would be performed. But if the Normality Assumption is meaningfull and Variance Homogeneity is not, t test is performed but some arguemnts should be applied. For significance, we performed a parametric test.","36308b3f":"* Ho is rejected if p-value < 0.05\n* Ho cannot be rejected if p-value > 0.05\n\nHo is greater than 0.05 for control_df and test_df, so it is non-rejectable.

After A\/B test, results show that the averagebidding returns not much more purchase than maximumbidding. There is no significant difference between them. More purchases are not always more gains. While the purchase of low-priced products increased, the purchase of high-priced products may have decreased. Therefore, another test can be done by focusing on earnings. The only thing we can say for sure is that customers are not shopping more.","0fffb6e2":"**What is A\/B test?** \n\nIt is used when it is decided to make a comparison between the means of two groups.\n\n**Stages** \n\n1.

In this data set, which includes the website information of a customer, there is information such as the number of advertisements that users see and click, as well as earnings information from here."}}
