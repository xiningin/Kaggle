Whilst doing this, we'll also add support for combining some of the minority categories within our data features (since some are very imbalanced), and add support for producing additional dimensionality-reduced features (using PCA) to our dataset.\n\nThese extra features will allow us to experiment and tune to find the best combinations of feature engineering to perform for this problem.","c2e15184":"---","d2841fcf":"#### Exploring Ridge Hyper-parameters","e2da267b":"We have a few strong correlations between our variables, for instance, 'cont5' and 'cont8', 'cont9', 'cont10', 'cont11', and 'cont12'. Its possible that these share a lot of the same correlations, and therefore it could be worth trying to eliminate some of these, in order to make our model simpler and to avoid redundancy. \n\nAll things considered, they do not resemble anywhere near perfect correlation (1.0), and so keeping them in should not do too much harm in this case.\n\nIn looking at the target variable, it appears that no columns on their own are particularly correlated. This suggests a more complex relationship between our input data and output variable (assuming of course that such a relationship does in fact exist).","3f4da1e7":"<a id=\"pca\"><\/a>\n### 5.3 Exploring PCA and linear regression","6347f920":"Before moving on to more complex models, we'll just investigate how well a simple linear regression model can perform when using bootstrapping techniques:","fdd3dabe":"We want our residual plot points to be randomly dispersed close to the horizontal line. Due to the vast number of predictions, this is quite difficult to interpret effectively from just one residual plot. We'll plot training and test residuals seperately to make this more clear below:","583f9db0":"<a id=\"EDA\"><\/a>\n## 2.

We'll look at some simple examples for this next.\n\nFirst of all, we can automatically select the minority categories to combine within each of our features like so:","0df6c955":"Lets also look at our feature importances, as obtained from the Random Forest Regressor:","8236b474":"Similarly, lets see how well our residuals look compared to the previous simple linear regression models:","6f03fa8b":"<a id=\"load\"><\/a>\n## 1.

If it performs worse than a simple mathematical technique (such as the mean or median target value), then its not useful.\n\nWe'll make a baseline that simply predicts the average of the dependent output, so that can gauge how well this performs.","5ef53c7d":"<a id=\"ann-model-2\"><\/a>\n## Model 2 - Deep Self-Normalising SELU Network","903c5901":"In this case we are obtaining a negative $ R^{2} $ score, which is bad.
