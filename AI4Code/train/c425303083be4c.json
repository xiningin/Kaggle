This algorithm is used with relational databases for frequent itemset mining and association rule learning. It uses a bottom-up approach where frequent items are extended one item at a time and groups of candidates are tested against the available dataset.\n\nThe steps of working of the apriori algorithm can be given as:-\n\n1. Define the minimum support and confidence for the association rule\n2. Take all the subsets in the transactions with higher support than the minimum support\n3. Take all the rules of these subsets with higher confidence than minimum confidence\n4. Sort the association rules in the decreasing order of lift. \n5. Visualize the rules along with confidence and support."}}
