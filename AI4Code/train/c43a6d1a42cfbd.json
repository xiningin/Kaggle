Note that the boxplot() function detects outliers (called \"fliers\") and does not include them within the whiskers. Specifically, if the lower quartile is $Q_1$ and the upper quartile is $Q_3$, then the interquartile range $IQR = Q_3 - Q_1$ (this is the box's height), and any score lower than $Q_1 - 1.5 \\times IQR$ is a flier, and so is any score greater than $Q3 + 1.5 \\times IQR$.","17f3dfa4":"<br>\n<br>\n\n\nThe Embarked attribute tells us where the passenger embarked: C=Cherbourg, Q=Queenstown, S=Southampton.\n\nNote: the code below uses a mix of Pipeline, FeatureUnion and a custom DataFrameSelector to preprocess some columns differently.
