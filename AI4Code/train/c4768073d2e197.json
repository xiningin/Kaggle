There are already multiple datasets and notebooks for this competitions and I mostly based myself on [Hanjoon Choe's very nice notebook](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/hanjoonchoe\/resize-and-load-with-feather-format-much-faster) for this one.\n\nTheir are two objectives here:\n- make loading times faster with feather\n- resizing images to reduce the size of the dataset.\n\nOn that second point however, I've seen some people cropping images or resizing the images, but what I saw so far seemd to be rather random.\n\nIn this notebook, using OpenCV2, I'm making a bounding bow around each character to crop only the character, but still have all of it. However, there is a tricky part as these characters are composed on multiple strokes that sometimes do not touch each other. This is taken into account, by simply making a bigger bounding box englobing all the different ones.\n\nThere probably are faster ways of doing this, however since this is only supposed to be done once to prepare and save the data, I went for fastest implementation rather than run time.\n\nI hope you might find this notebook and it's outputs useful!\n\n\n**The dataset can be found [here](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/maxlenormand\/cropped-resized-bengaliai-images)**","4ccf87b7":"We get a dataframe just like the original ones, but with a CROP_SIZE * CROP_SIZE number of columns + the image_id column.

To show that this notebook takes this into account, here is one resized & cropped example with multiple independant symbols in it:","8d8f7fe9":"We reduced the image size by **3.23** times.\n\nThat's not that bad. Especially if, like me, you don't have access to any good GPUs. Reducing the size efficiently while keeping the most information is particularly important and interesting.","4c47cb9f":"Now we can do all three other datasets"}}
