In October of 2016, the FCC fined them 2.3 million dollars after receiving over 1000 consumer complaints. This notebook contains customer complaint data retrieved from Kaggle's public dataset.\n\n**Goal**: The goal of this analysis is to further understand customer complaint data in order to influence future business decisions.\n\n**Methods**:\n- Step 1: Understand the business and the objective for analysis.\n- Step 2: Retrieve\/import the data\n- Step 3: Explore and clean the data (EDA)\n- Step 4: Build visualizations\n- Step 5: Communicate results","bd437df5":"Important data points include the **rating**, the **location**, the **date**, and the **text** data. Therefore an outline for further analysis is as follows:\n\n- Step 1. Visualize and count the rating data in the 'rating' column.\n- Step 2. Visualize and count the location data in the 'author' column.\n- Step 3. Plot the timeseries data from the 'posted_on' column.\n- Step 4. Process and visualize the natural language from the 'text' column.","4563ab81":"In the plot above, we can see that customer complaints have increased in time over the past 10 years with a notable spike in complaints in 2015. Further analysis could be conducted to determine what caused this spike in 2015.","96a8890c":"**Results and Conclusion**\n\n**Results**:\n- 5554 negative complaints: (>90%) of complaints rated as a '1' or a '0'\n- Highest number of complaints by locations: Florida, California, Georgia.\n- Steady increase in # of complaints over past 10 years. Most amount of complaints received in 2015.\n- Common complaints: Customer service, billing.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nCustomers that sent in the most amount of negative complaints were most likely to complain about issues relating to customer service or billing. There has been a steady rise in complaints received over the past 10 years and further analysis may need to be conducted to determine what caused a spike in complaints in 2015. Customer service locations in problematic states such as Florida, California, and Georgia may need to be addressed.","38a4a2c1":"From the graph above, you can see that Florida sent in the most amount of negative complaints followed by California, then Georgia.","43d26267":"Common customer complaints: Service, customer service, bill, problem, call, called, charge","f7595bfa":"This data makes sense because we are analyzing data that contains customer complaints so we would expect a high number of low ratings. Because a rating of '3' could be described as neutral and a rating > 3 is positive; we will want to clean this data to include ratings that are less than or equal to 2.","e4f7f4c3":"We can see from the extracted data that customers sent in the most amount of complaints in 2015, and the past 3 years received the most amount of complaints."}}
