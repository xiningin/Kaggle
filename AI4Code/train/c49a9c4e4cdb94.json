The top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you.\n\n**Log GDP per capita**: At its most basic interpretation, per capita GDP shows how much economic production value can be attributed to each individual citizen. Alternatively, this translates to a measure of national wealth since GDP market value per person also readily serves as a prosperity measure.\n\n**Social support**: Social support is defined in terms of social network characteristics such as assistance from family, friends, neighbours and other community members.\n\n**Healthy life expectancy at birth**: Healthy life expectancy is the average life in good health - that is to say without irreversible limitation of activity in daily life or incapacities - of a fictitious generation subject to the conditions of mortality and morbidity prevailing that year\n\n**Freedom to make life choices**: Freedom of choice describes an individual's opportunity and autonomy to perform an action selected from at least two available options, unconstrained by external parties.\n\n**Generosity**: Generosity is the virtue of being liberal in giving, often as gifts.\n\n**Perceptions of corruption**: Corruption is a form of dishonesty or criminal offense undertaken by a person or organization entrusted with a position of authority, to acquire illicit benefit","d4237856":"1.
