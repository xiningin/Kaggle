And that there are no casual customers who are member in this option.","db21e76d":"Similar to casual customers behaviour, it seems that subscribers to bike_share_for_all_trip have similar number of rides during the whole week, with a slight decrease during weekends.\n\nNext we will check the relation between user type and gender.","7a9cc6f7":"It looks like all participants in this option are only subscribers.\n\nNext, we will check the relation between the number of rides per weekday and gender.","866f5f30":"We can see that the duration distribution is some how similar across the weekdays, with a slight more variance in the weekends.\n\nNext, we will check the relation between ride duration and user type.","11b703e4":"We can see that casual customers tend to have less variance in ride duration with age compared to subscribers and also more average ride duration.\n\nNext, we will check the relation between ride duration, age and subscription to bike_share_for_all_trip.","c518f804":"The distribution exhibit a long tail which suggests that we try a log transformation.","e6f37b82":"We can clearly see that the distribution is bimodal, with one peak around 8 am. and another at about 5 pm. which adds more strength to the idea that the rides are mainly used to go to and from work.\n\nNext we will check the distribution of gender.","15917591":"There doesn't seem to be any clear relation for those variables with age.\n\nNext, we will check the relation between ride duration, gender and user type.","3082fa2b":"The distribution is skewed to the right, but it doesnt seem like a long tail. We will try a log transformation again.","ff30a5ec":"Using a boxplot we can see more acurately that most of the ages lie between about 27 and 40 years with a midean of 32 years.\n\nNow we will check the distribution of rides across the month days.","eebf8e78":"The member_birth year has an unreasonable value for a minimum of 1878, we need to check for values to remove.

This strengths the suggestion we mentioned before that subscribers are mainly using the system to go to work while normal customers are using it for other purposes during all days.\n\nNext we will check the relation between number of rides per week day and subscription in bike_share_for_all_trip.","1639fb28":"### Summary:\n### Relationships observed in this part of the investigation:\n\n> There is less variance in the ride duration with age for females than for males. Also, the same behaviour happens with casual customers compared to subscribers.\n\n> Average ride duration is highest for casual customers then subscribers who are not member of bike_share_for_all_trip then those who are member in this option.\n\n### Interactions between features:\n\n> There are no extra interactions between features.","9c010d41":"Next. we will check the distribution of age.","e90f12a0":"### Structure of the dataset:\n\n> The data originally had 183412 entries with 16 features. Null values and irresonable data were removed and new features were added to have an updated 171234 entries in the dataset with 20 features; some are numerical and some are categorical and 2 are datetime. The data represents the rides during February of 2019.\n\n### Main feature(s) of interest in the dataset:\n\n> The average duration of a trip and how it is affected by the other features. Also, we need to describe when most trips are taken.\n\n### Features in the dataset that I think will help support the investigation into the feature(s) of interest:\n\n> I think hour of the day, day of the week, age, gender, a user being a subscriber, and a user being a member of 'bike_share_for_all_trip' will affect how the main features will behave.","1febf693":"### Summary:\n### The distributions of the variables of interest:\n\n> The ride duration exhibts a log normal distribution with most of the rides having a duration between 5 and 15 minutes.\nMost of the rides take place during weekdays with a daily bimodal distribution with peaks at 8 am. and 5 pm. suggesting the the rides are used mainly to go to and from work.\n\n### The distributions of the other variables:\n\n> The other variables have their own distributions without any abnormal behaviour. Age was eventually decribed via a log transformation with most of the ages between 27 and 40 years.","a2e85425":"We can see that subscribers tend to have less average ride times compared to normal customers. It seems that most of the subscribers are using the system to go to and from work, with the same round trip time every day.\n\nNext, we will check the relation between ride duration and gender.","f9e3b3ee":"It looks like females are overall younger than men with less variance in their age. This can partially explain how the variance in duration decreases with age, as females tend to have more average ride duration than men and they are less probable to be in higher ages.\n\nNext we will check the relation between gender and user_type.","45852b11":"The log transformed distribution have a high similarity to a normal distribution. We can clearly see that most of the rides range between 5 and 15 minutes, with a mean of about 10 minutes.

There is still some tail. We can try a square root transform.","b44eebbc":"## Bivariate Exploration\n\nFirst, we will start by investigating the relation between ride duration and week days."}}
