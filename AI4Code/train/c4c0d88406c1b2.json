The first and the most important step of the roadmap is thoroughly going through the problem description\n    of the Analysis. This would help us gain information about what we should analyze, what is important, and\n    on what basis must the data be worked upon.\n2. Another important step is to thoroughly go through the data provided and how it is structured. This would\n    help us better understand how operations should be performed on the data to gain insights.\n3. Part I: GDP Analysis of the Indian States, was divided into two subparts, Part IA and Part IIB.\n4. For Part IA , State wise GDP was used to gain insights. Only the average growth of states for the duration\n    2013 14, 2014 15 and 2015 16 by taking the mean of the row '(% Growth over previous year)\u2019 was\n    considered. States such as West Bengal was not considered due to complete absence of data. For any\n    missing values in the GSDP and the %Growth over the previous year were replaced by the All India mean\n    values as filling them with zero or removing those specific states from the analysis could provide us with\n    unrealistic data. Finally Average Growth Rate and Total GDP for all the states were plotted and insights\n    were drawn.\n    For Part IB , each of the states were loaded into different data frames. Union Territories were filtered, as they\n    are governed directly by the center, not state governments; and the analysis was only for the duration 2014 15.\n6. All the data frames were Inner Merged on the Sectors as they were consistent in the data for all the states. The\n    NA values were replaced by zero as that indicates that in that state for that sub sector, there is no contribution.\n7. GDP per capita for all the states is plotted. The percentage contribution of the primary, secondary and tertiary\n    sectors as a percentage of the total GDP for all the states is the plotted.\n8. The states are the categorized based on their Per Capita GDP. The states lying between the 85th and the 100th\n    percentile are in C1; those between the 50th and the 85th percentiles are in C2, those between the 20th and the\n    50th percentiles are in C3, those equal to and below the 20th percentile are in C4. New data frames are assigned\n    for each of the Categories.\n9. Only the contributing subsectors of each state towards the GSDP are considered. This is to avoid redundancy\n    and remove sub sub sectors during our analysis as the sum of all the sub sub sectors give the sub sector.\n10. A new column i.e. Tax Subsidies that is the difference between the Tax on Products and Subsidies on Products is\n    introduced. It is only when we add the cumulative sub sectors and the Tax and then subtract the subsidies, we get\n    the GSDP i.e. Gross State Domestic Product=TOTAL GSVA at basic prices +Taxes on Products Subsidies on\n    products.\n11. A pie is then plotted accordingly that indicates us the percentage of GSDP towards which the sub sector\n    contributes for all the categories and insights are drawn.\n12. Here we are not considering the Taxes Subsidies segment though it is contributing to the total GSDP, as\n    taxes and subsidies are variable and can be controlled by the government hence, they cannot be classified as\n    a contributing sub sector.\n13. For Part II: GDP and Education Dropout Rates , we first load the dropout rate dataset into a new data\n    frame. We would be needing only dropout rates in education (primary, upper primary and secondary) for\n    the year 2014 2015 for each state.\n14. We the extract the Per capita GSDP for the year 2014 15 from our already existing dataset into a new data\n    frame and merge it with the dropout rate dataset.\n15. A correlation is then drawn to analyze how the Primary 14 15, Upper Primary 14 15, and Secondary 14 15\n    dropout rates are pitched against the Per Capita GSDP for the year 2014 15 and insights are drawn.\n","a3e411ee":"- Union territories (Delhi, Chandigarh, Andaman and Nicobar Islands and Puducherry) are filtered out for further analysis, as they are governed directly by the centre, not state governments.\n- The data of only 4 union territories was available.","263cd2c4":"- We first load data of each of the states into different dataframes.","20a5ba47":"- Average growth of states for the duration 2013-14, 2014-15 and 2015-16.","f276bc5b":"- Changing the name of the states which appear to have different spellings in the dropout rate data set would be helpful when doing merge and also help reduce redundant data.","d8cc37cc":"- Plot for average growth rates of the various states.","5daaeff2":"### Part I-B:","6c0a338b":"- Setting the names of the states as the Index.","793036af":"- Creating a new dataframe that consists of only the contributing subsectors of each state towards the GSDP.

Firstly, for the 16 states that need to focus on the Primary Sector; it is very critical that a change must be\n    brought in the contribution from this sector when compared to others. Since the sector mainly deals with\n    Agriculture, it is recommended that the state government provide additional financial support for farmers.\n    A stabilized price can be zeroed upon for all the commodities in these sectors so that there is no financial\n    strain during the off seasons. Taxes can be reduced and the subsidies can be increased for this sector to\n    ensure rise in the contribution towards GSDP.\n2. For the 12 states that need to focus on Secondary Sector, it is recommended that small scale manufacturing\n    units are well supported logistically and the raw materials be made available to them with subsidised prices.\n    Upgrading existing technologies in the present utility services(electricity, gas, water supply stations) may\n    generate additional revenue over time.\n3. It can be observed that the Tertiary Sector is the strongest sector in almost all states. It is advisable that to\n    maintain the inflow of revenue from all sectors equally, taxes can be increased and subsidies can be reduced\n    for this sector for a time until the equilibrium is met. This may also ensure that citizens establish themselves\n    into Primary and Secondary Sectors first and Tertiary last.\n\n### Categorical Recommendations\n1. For the states in Category 1, it is recommended to focus on Financial services, Public administration,\n    Electricity, gas, water supply & other utility services.\n2. For the states in Category 2, it is recommended to focus on Transport, storage, communication & services\n    related to broadcasting, Public administration, Electricity, gas, water supply & other utility services.\n3. For the states in Category 3, it is recommended to focus on Public administration, Financial services,\n    Electricity, gas, water supply & other utility services.\n4. For the states in Category 4, it is recommended to focus on Public administration, Financial services,\n    Electricity, gas, water supply & other utility services\n    \nAll the states are recommended to focus on Public administration and Electricity, gas, water supply & other\nutility services as they are common amongst all Categories of States for Per Capita GDP.\n\nNote: Mining and Quarrying is geographical in nature and hence is at the discretion of the State.","3dff3350":"- Filling the na values to zero makes sense as that indicates that in that state for that particular sub-sector, there is no contribution.","0db02e6d":"- We then rename the coulumns specific to the state so that ther would not be any confusion when we merge the dataframes.","380fdd84":"- The states lying between the 85th and the 100th percentile are in C1; those between the 50th and the 85th percentiles are in C2, those between the 20th and the 50th percentiles are in C3, those equal to and below the 20th percentile are in C4.\n- New dataframes are assigned for each of the Categories.","5cc64dba":"- The highest per capita GDP is 8 times the lowest per capita GDP.","a7f28a34":"- The ratio of the highest per capita GDP to the lowest per capita GDP :","0dba34ad":"Here we can see that for the first category of states i.e. __C1__, the top sub-sectors that contribute to approximately 80% of the GSDP after adding up the individual percentages are:  \n__1)Manufacturing  \n2)Agriculture, forestry and fishing  \n3)Trade, repair, hotels and restaurants  \n4)Real estate, ownership of dwelling & professional services  \n5)Construction  \n6)Other Services  \n7)Transport, storage, communication & services related to broadcasting__  \n*Note: Here we are not considering the Taxes-Subsidies segment though it is contributing to the total GSDP, as taxes and subsidies are variable and can be controlled by the government hence they cannot be classified as a contributing sub sector.*","f6919996":"- The Subsectors are sorted by the Total that indicates us the subsectors contributing most towards the GSDP.","19800b25":"- Plotting using seaborn; a barplot that indicates Per capita GDP on the x axis and names of the various states on the y axis.\n- Figsize can be altered as per out requirements and data visibility.","2d66c811":"- Pie chart creation using datframe.plot for all the states, also indicated is the percentage of each of the sectors.","350c0086":"- We then plot the pie accordingly that also indicates us the percentage of GSDP towards which the sub-sector contributes.","85f093a2":"Here we can see that for the third category of states i.e. __C3__, the top sub-sectors that contribute to approximately 80% of the GSDP after adding up the individual percentages are:  \n__1)Agriculture, forestry and fishing  \n2)Manufacturing  \n3)Trade, repair, hotels and restaurants  \n4)Real estate, ownership of dwelling & professional services  \n5)Construction  \n6)Other Services  \n7)Mining and quarrying  \n8)Transport, storage, communication & services related to broadcasting__  \n*Note: Here we are not considering the Taxes-Subsidies segment though it is contributing to the total GSDP, as taxes and subsidies are variable and can be controlled by the government hence they cannot be classified as a contributing sub sector.*","53331bca":"- Copying the transpose of the current dataframe into a new one as it would be helpful in plotting the data.","f763cff0":"- We transpose the dataframe for better representations.","f6bc706a":"- Using the first row values as the column names to replace the numbers and then deleting the row.","33040cc6":"- We now create a new column \"Total\" that is the cummulative sum of all the sub sectors through out the states in each of the category.","152c3f64":"- Load the dropout rate dataset into the dataframe","cdc0821c":"- We would be needing only dropout rates in education (primary, upper primary and secondary) for the year 2014-2015 for each state.\n- Deleting additional columns and renaming the columns would be helpful in analysis.","3a271cbf":"- Here we can cleary see that Himanchal Pradesh, Maharashtra, Manipur, Mizoram, Nagaland, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tripura and Andaman & Nicobar Island have 2 missing values.\n- We would not be considering West Bengal due to the complete absence of Data.","e7c7b732":"### Part-II: GDP and Education Dropout Rates","04f0f1f8":"- We then drop the columns Taxes and Subsidies as we now have the calculated value of tax-subsidies."}}
