For each category, ask the user for a number of things in that category. You should print something for each category that states the category and the three things in that category.\n\nHere is what running your final program should look like:\n\n```\nWould you like to do another category? Yes\nEnter a category: animals\nHow many would you like to list? 3\nEnter something in that category: cheetah\nEnter something in that category: pelican\nEnter something in that category: red panda\nanimals: cheetah pelican red panda\n\nWould you like to do another category? Yes\nHow many would you like to list? 3\nEnter a category: noises\nEnter something in that category: vroom!\nEnter something in that category: whirrr!\nEnter something in that category: whooosh!\nnoises: vroom! whirrr! whooosh!\n\nWould you like to do another category? Yes\nHow many would you like to list? 2\nEnter a category: programming languages\nEnter something in that category: Python\nEnter something in that category: Java\nprogramming languages: Python Java\n\nWould you like to do another category? No\n```\n\nNote: You will need to use NESTED control structures\n\nWant to make it better?\n* Use Python output formatting tools\n* Add functionality that allows users to put in an element, and the program responds with which category it is in.\n* Anything else!","cdd4ca4a":"#### Mastery Possibilities:\nfor loops, while loops, counters\/accumulators, printing, user input, and more!\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Requirement<\/th>\n    <th>Description<\/th>\n    <th>Points<\/th>\n    <th> Earned <\/th>\n  <\/tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td> Originality <\/td>\n    <td> All code is your own.

Getting all of the things to print\n*   What was the easiesy part of this project? Starting the while loop\n*   How did you utilize your peer feedback? I made all other question for if the user wanted to make a categorie with another besides the first one\n* What was different between your plan and the final project? I forgot to think about how I would print it\n* How well did you plan? Was your idea too easy? Too hard? Just right?
