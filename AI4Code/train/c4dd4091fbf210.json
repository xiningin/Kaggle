It is formed primarily of layers performing the convolution operation, but often includes other kinds of layers as well. (You'll learn about these in the next lesson.)\n\nThe head is used to **determine the class** of the image. It is formed primarily of dense layers, but might include other layers like dropout. \n\nWhat do we mean by visual feature? A feature could be a line, a color, a texture, a shape, a pattern -- or some complicated combination.\n\nThe whole process goes something like this:\n\n<center>\n<!-- <img src=\".\/images\/1-extract-classify.png\" width=\"600\" alt=\"The idea of feature extraction.\"> -->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/UUAafkn.png\" width=\"600\" alt=\"The idea of feature extraction.\">\n<\/center>\n\nThe features actually extracted look a bit different, but it gives the idea.","01c90092":"## Step 3 - Attach Head ##\n\nNext, we attach the classifier head. For this example, we'll use a layer of hidden units (the first `Dense` layer) followed by a layer to transform the outputs to a probability score for class 1, `Truck`. The `Flatten` layer transforms the two dimensional outputs of the base into the one dimensional inputs needed by the head.","e9040350":"## Step 4 - Train ##\n\nFinally, let's train the model. Since this is a two-class problem, we'll use the binary versions of `crossentropy` and `accuracy`. The `adam` optimizer generally performs well, so we'll choose it as well.","da0a3103":"## Step 1 - Load Data ##\n\nThis next hidden cell will import some libraries and set up our data pipeline. We have a training split called `ds_train` and a validation split called `ds_valid`.","ec8d1f71":"## Step 2 - Define Pretrained Base ##\n\nThe most commonly used dataset for pretraining is [*ImageNet*](http:\/\/image-net.org\/about-overview), a large dataset of many kind of natural images. Keras includes a variety models pretrained on ImageNet in its [`applications` module](https:\/\/www.tensorflow.org\/api_docs\/python\/tf\/keras\/applications). The pretrained model we'll use is called **VGG16**.","4ed1fc9b":"# Conclusion #\n\nIn this lesson, we learned about the structure of a convnet classifier: a **head** to act as a classifier atop of a **base** which performs the feature extraction.\n\nThe head, essentially, is an ordinary classifier like you learned about in the introductory course. For features, it uses those features extracted by the base. This is the basic idea behind convolutional classifiers: that we can attach a unit that performs feature engineering to the classifier itself.\n\nThis is one of the big advantages deep neural networks have over traditional machine learning models: given the right network structure, the deep neural net can learn how to engineer the features it needs to solve its problem.\n\nFor the next few lessons, we'll take a look at how the convolutional base accomplishes the feature extraction. Then, you'll learn how to apply these ideas and design some classifiers of your own.","0c27b6b2":"Let's take a look at a few examples from the training set.","0f6d120f":"# Introduction #\n\nThis course will introduce you to the fundamental ideas of computer vision. Our goal is to learn how a neural network can \"understand\" a natural image well-enough to solve the same kinds of problems the human visual system can solve.\n\nThe neural networks that are best at this task are called **convolutional neural networks** (Sometimes we say **convnet** or **CNN** instead.) Convolution is the mathematical operation that gives the layers of a convnet their unique structure. In future lessons, you'll learn why this structure is so effective at solving computer vision problems.\n\nWe will apply these ideas to the problem of **image classification**: given a picture, can we train a computer to tell us what it's a picture *of*? You may have seen [apps](https:\/\/identify.plantnet.org\/) that can identify a species of plant from a photograph. That's an image classifier! In this course, you'll learn how to build image classifiers just as powerful as those used in professional applications.\n\nWhile our focus will be on image classification, what you'll learn in this course is relevant to every kind of computer vision problem. At the end, you'll be ready to move on to more advanced applications like generative adversarial networks and image segmentation.","5a4b9eb9":"# Training the Classifier #\n\nThe goal of the network during training is to learn two things:\n1. which features to extract from an image (base),\n2. which class goes with what features (head).\n\nThese days, convnets are rarely trained from scratch. More often, we **reuse the base of a pretrained model**. To the pretrained base we then **attach an untrained head**. In other words, we reuse the part of a network that has already learned to do *1. Extract features*, and attach to it some fresh layers to learn *2. Classify*.\n\n<center>\n<!-- <img src=\".\/images\/1-attach-head-to-base.png\" width=\"400\" alt=\"Attaching a new head to a trained base.\"> -->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/imgur.com\/E49fsmV.png\" width=\"400\" alt=\"Attaching a new head to a trained base.\">\n<\/center>\n\nBecause the head usually consists of only a few dense layers, very accurate classifiers can be created from relatively little data. \n\nReusing a pretrained model is a technique known as **transfer learning**. It is so effective, that almost every image classifier these days will make use of it.","47143ace":"When training a neural network, it's always a good idea to examine the loss and metric plots. The `history` object contains this information in a dictionary `history.history`. We can use Pandas to convert this dictionary to a dataframe and plot it with a built-in method."}}
