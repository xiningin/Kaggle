The algorithm behind the JPEG standart comes from Discrete Cosine Transform. A discrete cosine transform (DCT) expresses a finite sequence of data points in terms of a sum of cosine functions oscillating at different frequencies. Therefore, an image can be represtented with linear combinations of Discrete Cosine Transform coefficients. \n\n![DCT](https:\/\/users.cs.cf.ac.uk\/Dave.Marshall\/Multimedia\/DCT.jpg)\n\n > The DCT transforms an 8\u00d78 block of input values to a linear combination of these 64 patterns. The patterns are referred to as the two-dimensional DCT basis functions, and the output values are referred to as transform coefficients. The top left corner of the transform image represtents lowest frequency, when we move to bottom right corner we are encountering higher frequencies. An image is actually includes most of those frequencies, as I said in first sentence the image can be represtent with linear combinations of those parts of the frequency blocks.","f9f8f32e":"**The Original Image**\n> I called showImage function, which is defined above.\n> You can choose between those 4 images which are located in input folder by changing the directory variable.","c7bee906":"Since *cv2.dct* operation requires floating numbers for discrete cosine transform, I am executing a int2float transform here.

Later I am planning to improve these upcoming lines.\n\n> Before computing the DCT of the 8\u00d78 block, its values are shifted from a positive range to one centered on zero. For an 8-bit image, each entry in the original block falls in the range [0,255] . The midpoint of the range (in this case, the value 128) is subtracted from each entry to produce a data range that is centered on zero, so that the modified range is [-128,127] . This step reduces the dynamic range requirements in the DCT processing stage that follows.","06c51724":"My resources are: \n* Ozyegin University (https:\/\/www.ozyegin.edu.tr\/en)\n* Hochschule der Median (https:\/\/www.hdm-stuttgart.de)\n* Wikipedia (https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/JPEG)\n","808b2578":"**Reason for Quantization & Quantization Arrays**\n>  The human eye is good at seeing small differences in brightness over a relatively large area, but not so good at distinguishing the exact strength of a high frequency brightness variation. This allows one to greatly reduce the amount of information in the high frequency components. This is done by simply dividing each component in the frequency domain by a constant for that component, and then rounding to the nearest integer. This rounding operation is the only lossy operation in the whole process (other than chroma subsampling) if the DCT computation is performed with sufficiently high precision. As a result of this, it is typically the case that many of the higher frequency components are rounded to zero, and many of the rest become small positive or negative numbers, which take many fewer bits to represent.\n\n> Since** DCT coefficient will be divided to quantization arrays elementwise**, the higher value on quantization array will cause higher compression to image.
