First, I'll analyze if it's the price:","df1c4117":"A lot of sneakers have a strong negative correlation with the release date. It means that, with the pass of the time, the sneaker starts to devalue. However, some sneakers like the V2 Beluga, one of the most sold, continues with good value by the time.

I'll focus on Yeezy Sneakers to find more specific details that influence the shoe price, but the same analysis could be made for the Off-White sneakers, to find another results.","05eca207":"# Conclusion\nIn this notebook, we were able to see some of the main features that affect the price of an Yeezy sneakers. A lot of sneakers start with a very high resell price and decreases over time, another ones, which I would consider as a good investment, present high profit, high demand and low devaluation. \n\nWe can see that Yeezy sneakers are a lot popular, too. Even with some high prices, they sell almost 3x than Off-Whites, which probably has less products in stock when it releases in retail. \n\nAfter that, I constructed a model to predict the price of the yeezy sneakers. It performed good, as I expected it would be hard to predict the prices with a little number of variables, but I think that I used, in this model, the 3 more important: time passed since release, shoe size and the sneaker model.","39fc6d2e":"First step of my exploratory data analysis is see which sneakers are more popular (i.e. had more sales on StockX) and see which factors are influencing on their price.","8455344f":"1st step: adjust data types\n    \nRelease Date and Order Date -> datetime\n\nRetail and Sale prices -> float","2ba9aff8":"It's clear that the Yeezys are a lot different individually. The Beluga's behavior in our analysis was completely different than the Cream White's, for example. Since we have this differences, there isn't any correlation appearing in the macro scenario, but when analyzing the sneakers individually, as I did before, we see that we can find some interesting features to help the regressor.","36a67a35":"The most sold sneakers are from 10, 9 and 9.5 size.
