Log transoform is only applied on the target in this version, not on the features. I will be applying the log transoform on the features in future versions of this kernel*","778581d0":"* Our goal is to minimize the error, we use regularization methods: Ridge, Lasso and ElasticNet, in order to lower the squared error.\n\n> ### The metric RMSE:\nThe metric in this competition is RMSE. We will create a function ```score()``` (it takes one input parameter: Our predictions) to compute the RMSE score with all the models that will be used."}}
