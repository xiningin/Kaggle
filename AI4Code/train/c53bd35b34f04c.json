The mean average PDC was 22.7% with a standard deviation of 59.2%. This makes sense given the wide range from defenders getting badly burned to close encounters. Most of the time the closest defensive back was making up around one fifth of the distance between them and the targeted receiver while the ball was in the air. The histogram below shows the shape of the data:\n\n![histogram](http:\/\/danoff.org\/hist_pct_distance_closed.png)\n\nNext, we looked to see whether or not our key metric increased the odds of successful on field outcomes for defenders. We ran a logistic regression with PDC as the independent variable and if the pass was incomplete as the dependent variable. We found that PDC was not significant at the 10% level (*p* = 0.18). You can see the full results of all our regressions in the appendix.  \n\nWe tried again with more independent variables: \n* Number of defenders in the box\n* Number of pass rushers\n* Distance closed (total, not percentage)\n* Defender weight\n* Defender height\n* Targeted receiver height\n* Targeted receiver weight\n* Yardline\n* Yards to go\n* Expected Points Added (EPA)\n\nThis time PDC was significant at the 10% level (*B* = -0.008, *p* = -0.029, Odds Ratio = 1.008). In this case, we can specifically state that the better the defensive back is at closing the gap between themselves and the targeted receiver while the ball is in the air, the better the odds of an incomplete pass. The other significant predictors were Number of pass rushers, Distance Closed (in total), yardline number, yards to go, and EPA.\n\nWe ran it again with only the significant predictors. This time they were all significant at the 10% level, except for yards to go. Of the significant variables, the number of pass rushers had the highest odds ratio of 1.491, indicating that in this regression the number of pass rushers increased the odds of an incomplete pass the most. PDC was second at 1.008. This indicates that the number of pass rushers (which may lead to the quarterback being more pressured) is more influential on the outcome of a pass than how much the closest defensive back closes the gap to the target receiver.\n\nNext we looked to see how individual defensive backs scored in PDC. In the chart below we show the top 15 defensive backs in PDC for the 2018 season with a minimum of 40 plays where they were the closest defender to the targeted receiver. \n\n![Top 15 Defensive Backs](http:\/\/danoff.org\/Top15DefensiveBacksDash3.png)\n\nAdrian Amos, a safety for the Bears, had the highest average PDC at 44%. He was not one of the top defenders according to Pro Football Focus, but his fellow Bears safety Eddie Jackson was 4th on the list at 36% and he was listed as [the top safety of the year by PFF](https:\/\/www.pff.com\/news\/pro-best-player-at-every-position-in-the-nfl-in-2018). Amongst cornerbacks, Jonathan Joseph plus Kareem Jackson of the Texans along with Adoree\u2019 Jackson of the Titans and A.J. Bouye of the Jaguars were listed in the [top 25 cornerbacks of 2018 by PFF](https:\/\/www.pff.com\/news\/pro-top-25-cornerbacks-in-the-nfl-in-2018). \n\nWe then looked to see how different positions fared. Free Safeties had the highest mean PDC at 29%. Cornerbacks were the lowest amongst defensive backs at 17%. Not far behind them were Middle Linebackers at 15%. \n\nWe felt that this made sense when considering that cornerbacks are typically tracking their assignments more closely when the ball is thrown in the first place, as evidenced by our data. We observed that cornerbacks were 4.57 yards away from the targeted receiver when the pass was thrown, on average (n=6,879). For safeties of all types the distance was more at 6.24 yards away, on average (n=2,609). \n\nDue to this, we have reason to believe that the PDC metric is higher for safeties because cornerbacks are already in more of a position to make a play when the ball is thrown and when it arrives. The distance when the ball arrives data shows that cornerbacks are 3.49 yards away on average (n=6,879) to 4.16 yards for safeties (n=2,609). \n\nWith the larger gap for safeties they have more of an incentive to \u201cget on their horse\u201d and cover as much ground as possible by the time the ball does arrive, hence the larger percentages illustrated below:\n\n![Comparing Positions](http:\/\/danoff.org\/ComparingPositions3.png)\n\nWe also looked at a scatter plot with average PDC on the y-axis and average pass distance on the x-axis. Similar to our finding above, amongst defensive backs, free safeties had covered the longest passes while corners the least. \n\n![Scatter Plot](http:\/\/danoff.org\/ScatterPlot.png)\n\n## Including Zone as a Variable\n\nWe thought that there could be some interesting findings within our data if we decided to parse things out by zone and man coverage for contextual purposes, given the different responsibilities of defensive backs (as well expalined by [former college corner Micheal Felder](https:\/\/bleacherreport.com\/articles\/1745443-how-to-read-and-react-a-college-cornerbacks-guide-to-pre-snap-pass-defense)). Within our final dataset of approximately 13,896 plays we found 737 observations (5%) that had information on what coverage the defense was in (thanks to the [bonus dataset](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/tombliss\/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021-bonus)). Of those 737 observations, 509 (69%) were zone, and 228 (31%) were man coverage. Here is a quick rundown of the coverage-contextualized findings:\n\n* The average number of defenders in the box when in man coverage was 6.37 to zone\u2019s 5.95\n* The average number of expected points added is .27 when man coverage is called versus zone\u2019s .07. \n    * This falls in line with our expectations where higher stakes situations call for tighter coverage.\n* An offense\u2019s yards to go on average was 8.02 in man, and 9.62 in zone\n    * This also falls in line with the expectations of higher stakes situations calling for man coverage since it is typically tighter\n* As expected, the defensive back\u2019s average distance to the targeted receiver when the ball is passed forward in man coverage (3.33 yards) is lower than in zone (5.90)\n* As expected, the defensive back\u2019s average distance to the targeted receiver when the ball arrives in man coverage (2.67 yards) is lower than in zone (4.38)\n* As expected, the average distance closed by a defensive back on a targeted receiver is lower in man coverage (.65 yards) than in zone (1.52)\n* The average PDC by a defensive back on a targeted receiver is lower in man coverage (7.37%) than in zone (20.88%)\n* Offenses typically earn nearly one extra yard on average when passing versus man coverage (8.97) over zone (8.02) \n* In man coverage, the offense\u2019s pass outcome is found to be a touchdown 3.51% of the time compared to 1.38% in zone. \n    * Zone is considered to be a safer option. For example, at the end of a game defenses may employ a prevent defense, which can be thought of as a \u201chyper\u201d zone. And as we mentioned above man is used more in tighter situations so it makes sense that there are more plays with defensive backs scored upon since they are in a riskier situation in the first place as evidenced by the EPA data referenced above. \n\nFinally, we compared PDC by position and coverage. In all cases the PDC was higher for zone than it was for man.\n\n![Scatter Plot](http:\/\/danoff.org\/ComparingPositionsbyCoverage3.png)","ae50eb73":"# Appendix\n\nLinks\n\n* [GitHub Repo](https:\/\/github.com\/danoff\/Mind-the-PDC-Gap)\n\n## Code","801881ef":"This is the NFL Big Data Bowl 2021 submission from team **isaihchrischarlie** by collaborators [Isaih](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/zayuhtheiv), [Chris](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/christopherhanes), and [Charlie](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/danoff).","11a5687e":"# Methodology\n\nNow we will outline our methodological approach to preparing the base data for analysis.\n\n1. We define pass defenders as any player playing any of the following positions during a play: \n    * Cornerback\n    * Defensive Back\n    * Free Safety\n    * Inside Linebacker\n    * Middle Linebacker\n    * Outside Linebacker\n    * Safety\n    * Strong Safety\n\n2.

We calculate the identified pass defender\u2019s distance to target receiver at the moment pass was thrown (i.e., at the pass forward event).\n\n5. We calculate a distance closed variable by subtracting the identified defender\u2019s distance to the target receiver at the moment of pass arrival from the distance from the distance at the moment the pass was thrown.\n\n6. We normalize the distance closed variable by turning it into a percentage and call it Percent Distance Closed (PDC).","7bf1dd3e":"# Introduction\n\nDrawing on our team strengths, our approach was to focus less on sophisticated machine learning and more on having crisp data visualizations and clear writing informed by football game expertise. We all have experience doing data analysis. Chris has extensive knowledge of databases, Charlie writes, and Isaih is our [Subject Matter Expert](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Subject-matter_expert) (SME) on the game drawing on his time playing defensive back in high school. Isaih and Charlie have been researching sports analytics for multiple years and [submitted an entry](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/danoff\/neural-networks-isaih-divya-charlie-version?scriptVersionId=24162374) to the last big data bowl. \n\nThis time we wanted to evaluate which defenders close gaps best while the ball was in the air. In other words, when the ball leaves the quarterback\u2019s hands to when it arrives at the targeted receiver. On one play for example, Marcus Williams was 8.19 yards away from the targeted receiver at the \"pass forward\" event and 5.96 yards away at the \"pass arrived\" event, good for a 27.2% gap decrease.\n\nAnother factor we wanted to consider was which specific defender we were going to analyze on a given play. We decided that a corner on the other side of the field defending a non-targeted receiver should not be part of the evaluation. We created a dummy variable to show who is closest to the targeted receiver when the ball arrives. \n\nTo gain an outside perspective on who were some of the best defensive backs in the year we will be analyzing we reviewed the [Top 25 Cornerbacks in the NFL in 2018](https:\/\/www.pff.com\/news\/pro-top-25-cornerbacks-in-the-nfl-in-2018) from Pro Football Focus. As a way to audit the quality of our KPI, we will see if our top rated defenders align with the [PFF grades](https:\/\/www.pff.com\/grades).\n\n## Focus of Analysis\n\nUltimately the question we decided to focus on was: \n\n*Is a pass defender\u2019s percent distance closed to the target receiver, during the pass air time, a meaningful measure of pass defender performance?*","7b9ecac1":"# Conclusion\n\nOur key takeaway is that PDC can significantly increase the odds of an incomplete pass and it roughly aligns with qualitative assessments of top defensive backs by Pro Football Focus grades. Additionally PDC is meaningfully affected by both position and the type of defensive coverage. \n\nGiven all of this, we can see that situational football plays heavily into the type of coverage called on any given play. Thus, there is a lot of context to be considered when evaluating defensive back play. Coaches should consider PDC and other distance tracking metrics referenced when evaluating their defensive backs in regards to their ability to read and react, and in turn, prevent chunk yardage and touchdowns. ","9262eddf":"# Future Work\n\nIn the future we would like to understand the quantitative measurements of defensive backs more deeply. For instance, similar to what [Dutta, Yurko, Ventura](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1906.11373) suggested, can we create specific models for free safeties, strong safeties, and even nickel backs? Can we come up with a metric for how effective defensive backs are at stopping the run? Or now that we know more about PDC can we connect that to [data from the annual NFL combine](https:\/\/www.pro-football-reference.com\/draft\/2020-combine.htm) to see if things such as the shuttle drill actually connect with on-field performance at all? As [Caio Brighenti suggested](https:\/\/operations.nfl.com\/media\/4201\/bdb_brighenti.pdf), can we consider pitch control in our analysis? Could these defensive metrics help fantasy choose which defense to start in a given week or help bettors make the winning pick? "}}
