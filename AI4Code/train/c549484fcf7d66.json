The most basic reason behind hiding this from the fellow workers can be the social stigma attached to mental health.\n\n> The next factor that we will be discussing is '**leave.**'\n","359b6bb5":"<h3 style = \"font-family: Comic Sans MS;background-color:#D7BDE2\t\"> To be Noted: <\/h3>\n\nUnknowingly, we have stumbled upon the fact that the number of males in the dataset are 4 times the number of females. Thus, we must keep this in mind and avoid making any faulty assumptions that males are more susceptible to mental health issues etc. \n\nAlternatively, we may conclude that the number of males in the tech industry are much more as compared to the number of females (This research was conducted specifically for the tech industry.).\n","025cb4a1":"<h3 style = \"font-family: Comic Sans MS;background-color:#D7BDE2\t\"> Inference: <\/h3>\n\nThis is the respondent's answer to the question, '**Do you think that discussing a physical health issue with your employer would have negative consequences?**'\n\n* There is a starking difference between the reponses for the same question regarding mental and physical health. More than 70% of the employees believe that their physical health does not create a negative impact on their employer and only 5% of them believes that it does. \n* While it maybe incorrect for us to draw any conclusions about whether they seek mental help on the basis of their physical condition, because it is more or less same for all the three categories, we must keep in mind about **how differently mental and physical health are treated as a whole.**","4dbf471a":"![Alt Text](https:\/\/sa.kapamilya.com\/absnews\/abscbnnews\/media\/ancx\/culture\/2019\/57\/bannerburnout.jpg?ext=.jpg)\n\n<h1 style = \"font-family: Comic Sans MS;background-color:#D7BDE2\t\"> About this Kernel <\/h1>\n\nIn this kernel we'll try to understand what are the factos contributing the mental health of a person. This dataset is from a 2014 survey that measures attitudes towards mental health and frequency of mental health disorders in the tech workplace. This kernel is going to be different from my other kernels as together we are going to understand mental health at workplace in a systematic manner. So, what exactly is the first step? The first step towards this is getting the domain knowledge. Lets begin!\n\n\n\nThere are always a lot of great kernels regarding different ways of solving the problems but only a few handful address the problems of domain knowledge and getting started. In this notebook , I will start with complete explanation of everything you need know related to Prostate Cancer and its detection and I will built on that to explain the dataset,perform EDA and then Build a baseline model\n\n<h1 style = \"font-family: Comic Sans MS;background-color:#D7BDE2\t\"> Domain Knowledge #101 <\/h1>\n\n> **Q1 What exactly do we mean by Mental Health at workplace?**\n\nMental health affects your emotional, psychological and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. In the workplace, communication and inclusion are keys skills for successful high performing teams or employees. The impact of mental health to an organization can mean an increase of absent days from work and a decrease in productivity and engagement. In the United States, approximately 70% of adults with depression are in the workforce. Employees with depression will miss an estimated 35 million workdays a year due mental illness. Those workers experiencing unresolved depression are estimated to encounter a 35% drop in their productivity, costing employers $105 billion dollars each year.\n\n\n![Alt Text](https:\/\/exudeinc-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/mental-health.jpg)\n\n\n> **Q2 What can your employer do about this?**\n\nSo what can employers do? It\u2019s called Mental Health First Aid.\n\nMental Health First Aid teaches participants how to notice and support an individual who may be experiencing a mental health or substance use concern or crisis and connect them with the appropriate employee resources. It teaches employees critical communication and support skills that can influence your organizations bottom line.\n\nResearch shows that employees who go through Mental Health First Aid have an increased awareness of mental health among themselves and their co-workers. It allows them to recognize the signs of someone who maybe struggling and teaches them the skills to know when to reach out and what resources are available. Which in turn creates beneficial intervention that increases engagement and creates an environment of inclusion and support.\n\nEmployers can also offer robust benefit packages to support employees who go through mental health issues. That includes Employee Assistance Programs, Wellness programs that focus on mental and physical health, Health and Disability Insurance or flexible working schedules or time off policies.\n\nOrganizations that incorporate mental health awareness help to create a healthy and productive work environment that reduces the stigma associated with mental illness, increases the organizations mental health literacy and teaches the skills to safely and responsibly respond to a co-workers mental health concern.\n\nIncorporating mental health awareness in the workplace can help lead the way for mental health issues throughout your community by equipping people with the tools they need to start a dialogue so that more people can get the help they need.\n\n<h1 style = \"font-family: Comic Sans MS;background-color:#D7BDE2\t\"> Initial Understanding of the data #101 <\/h1>\n","e9c8c27f":"<h3 style = \"font-family: Comic Sans MS;background-color:#D7BDE2\t\"> Inference: <\/h3>\n\nThis was the respondent's answer to the question, **'Have you heard of or observed negative consequences for coworkers with mental health conditions in your workplace?'**\n\n* Majority ( 85% ) of the people, answered **No** to this question. This is quite important to note  that IT being an organised sector, follows strict guidelines of employee satisfaction etc. Thus, we didn't come across any major issue regarding the employer behavior as such!\n\n> Anyway, I think we're done with the EDA. Let me know if we left something out and I will try top cover that as well!","240bea66":"<h1 style = \"font-family: Comic Sans MS;background-color:#D7BDE2\t\"> Data Preparation <\/h1>\n"}}
