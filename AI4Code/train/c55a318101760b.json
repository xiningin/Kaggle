It is designed to be compatible with many existing CPU tools, such as Pandas, scikit-learn, numpy, etc. It enables **massive** acceleration of many data-science and machine learning tasks, oftentimes by a factor fo 100X, or more. \n\nRapids is still undergoing developemnt, and as of right now it's not availabel in the Kaggle Docker environment. If you are interested in installing and running Rapids locally on your own machine, then you should [refer to the followong instructions](https:\/\/rapids.ai\/start.html).\n\nThe first successful install of a Rapids library on kaggle was done by [Chris Deotte](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/cdeotte) in the follwiong [Digit Recognizer kernel](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/cdeotte\/rapids-gpu-knn-mnist-0-97). An improved install version that uses a Kaggle Dataset for install can be found [here](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/cdeotte\/rapids-data-augmentation-mnist-0-985).  In this kerenl we'll follow that approach.\n\nThe purpose of this kernel is to showcase the speedup that one gets with t-SNE and UMAP algorithm between the CPU versions and the Rapids version. The t-SNE Sklearn version can be found [here](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/tunguz\/kannada-mnist-2d-t-sne\/), and the UMAP version can be found [here](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/tunguz\/kannada-mnist-2d-umap\/)"}}
