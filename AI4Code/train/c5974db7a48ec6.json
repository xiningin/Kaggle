There are no target variables in the dataset, although 'price' could be considered as one.\n2. With 'price' as target variable, Regression models can be implemented to predict the prices.\n3. 'Unnamed: 0' feature seems to be an internal index which can be removed for model processing.\n4. Categorical features (represented by list 'categorical_vars' above) could be encoded for model data.\n5. PCA and correlation matrix will be useful to find features which may strongly predict 'price' of the car.\n6.
