Pre-Season should be limited to 2 Games and the Regular season should be extended to 19 weeks.\n2. The 53 Man roster should be increased to 56 player and the number of Suited players on Game Day should be increased to 49. In order to prevent Special teams injuries, Two new Positions should be added, Special Lineman and Designated Gunner.\n3. The NFL should develop a training program for individuals eligible who participate in Special teams plays on Tackling and Blocking, with special emphasis on skill moves not often used in their normal phase of play.","64ff955c":"We can see here that the 5 players most likely to be concussed are:\nTight End,\nInside Linebacker,\nCorner Back,\nOutside Linebacker and \nWide Reciever","afd228c2":"The Data I want to analyze is assembled. Let us analyze it.","d9492bab":"**Conclusion:****\n\n\nBased on the data above, I would like to suggest three preventable theories to injuries during Punt Plays:\n\n1. Players Selected to play during pre-season games are often less experienced than players selected to play during regular season games. As a result, they are less aware of how to protect themselves and suffer potentially avoidable concussions.\n\n2. Games including punt plays that result in a player suffering a concussion are more likely to occur toward the end of the regular season (does not extend into the Post Season). The 53-man roster adds strain on capable players as the season progresses and more player are added to the Injured reserve. The non IR players allowed to suit up is limited to 46 regardless of positions on IR\n\n3. Traditionally offensive players (i.e. WR) suffer injury during Tackling where they do not often Tackle in the Offensive Phase of the game. Also Traditionally Defensive players (i.e. CB and LBs) suffer injury during Blocking plays where they do not often block in the Defensive Phase of the game\n\n\n","3c63302b":"The Two primary Impact Types that causes the most concussions during punt plays in the 2016 and 2017 seasons were Helmet ot Body and Helmet to Helmet impacts.\n\nAmong Helmet to Body Impacts, 10 of 17 happened during Tackling actions (Tackling or being Tackled)\nAmong Helmet to Helmet Impacts, 9 of 17 happened during Blocking actions (Blocking or being Blocked)","2780dfdc":"Punting plays that result in concussion are twice as likely during the Second and Third Quarters of the game. Rather than a generally standard deviation."}}
