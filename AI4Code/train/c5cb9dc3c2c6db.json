We'll follow the exact same process to implement gradient descent:\n\n1. Generate predictions\n\n2. Calculate the loss\n\n3. Compute gradients w.r.t the weights and biases\n\n4. Adjust the weights by subtracting a small quantity proportional to the gradient\n\n5. Reset the gradients to zero\n\nThe only change is that we'll work batches of data, instead of processing the entire training data in every iteration. Let's define a utility function `fit` which trains the model for a given number of epochs.","a829d5d0":"We begin by importing Numpy and PyTorch:","e9380b2a":"`torch.sum` returns the sum of all the elements in a tensor, and the\u00a0`.numel` method returns the number of elements in a tensor. Let's compute the mean squared error for the current predictions of our model."}}
