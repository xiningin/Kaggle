There are less than four million inhabitants in the country, and in 19 per cent  of households someone emigrated between 2014 and 2019. Another of the study's conclusions confirms that the so-called demographic bonus has been lost. This factor is the result of a reduction in the fertility rate - families having fewer children - and a decrease in the mortality of a population - that is, people living longer. As a result, there is a greater proportion of citizens of working age - between 15 and 64 years old - in relation to the dependent population, children and the elderly.\n\n\nAll efforts to expand mass access to university education have lost their meaning. These benefits do not reach the poorest sectors.\n\nThe gloomy situation will worsen because of the pandemic . In April, when the country had been quarantined for a month and with few infections, 43 per cent of Venezuelans had reported that they were unable to work or that they had lost their income.\nhttps:\/\/translate.google.com.br\/translate?hl=en&sl=pt&u=https:\/\/oglobo.globo.com\/mundo\/venezuela-79-da-populacao-esta-em-extrema-pobreza-mostra-estudo-24521940&prev=search&pto=aue","bc0fd38d":"\nAnalyzing other aspects, such as employment, education, housing conditions and public services, poverty reaches 65 per cent of Venezuelan households - having increased by 13.8 per cent between 2018 and 2019.\n\nThe research included a new indicator called consumption poverty, which points out that 68 per cent of the population consumes less than the amount considered necessary for food per day, 2,000 calories. Food insecurity and precarious services have become an equalizing factor. Among the poorest and richest sectors, there are no notable differences in these aspects.\n\nAlthough higher-income citizens consume five times more meat than the poorest, the majority of the population eats below the recommended protein per day: 51 grams. Only 32 per cent of the population manages to ingest the necessary. To this factor is added the anthropometric data on child malnutrition: 30 per cent of children under the age of five - about 639 thousand people - have chronic malnutrition or short stature. The percentage is much higher than that of neighboring countries, being only lower than that of Guatemala.\n\nIn terms of poverty and malnutrition, the country has acquired conditions that are similar to those of others in Central America, the Caribbean and Africa. https:\/\/translate.google.com.br\/translate?hl=en&sl=pt&u=https:\/\/oglobo.globo.com\/mundo\/venezuela-79-da-populacao-esta-em-extrema-pobreza-mostra-estudo-24521940&prev=search&pto=aue\n\nLuis Pedro Espa\u00f1a also stresses that ending extreme poverty would require a direct transfer program equivalent to US $ 5 billion per year, which would allow giving two dollars a day to 6.5 million families.\n\nThe policy, however, is not viable for the government of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who suffers from the fall in oil production and is involved in a deep political and legitimacy crisis, cornered by international sanctions.\n\n- The State is deeply poor in order to be able to undertake this program and relaunch the economy, and, until we are able to enter the international financial system, we will be mired in precariousness - adds the sociologist.\n\n","a91acf9b":"#Venezuelan refugees receive humanitarian assistance in Brazil\n\nIn Brazil, Operation Welcome welcomes Venezuelan refugees and migrants who cross the border through the State of Roraima. This is the Humanitarian Logistics Task Force, carried out and coordinated by the Federal Government, with support from the Armed Forces, United Nations agencies and more than 100 civil society entities.\n\nAnd, in a time of pandemic, solidarity makes the difference. Refugees came together to give back work. Beneficiaries of Operation Welcomed joined Brazilian seamstresses and tailors to produce Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), essential items to face the virus.\n\nA relatively simple example, but one that proves that the communion of peoples can contribute to a more fraternal world. https:\/\/translate.google.com.br\/translate?hl=en&sl=pt&u=https:\/\/www.ecoamazonia.org.br\/2020\/06\/refugiados-venezuelanos-recebem-atendimento-humanitario-brasil\/&prev=search&pto=aue","250acff3":"![](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/www.gov.br\/defesa\/pt-br\/assuntos\/noticias\/refugiados-venezuelanos-recebem-atendimento-humanitario-no-brasil\/md_noticias_20200620_not02_f01.jpeg\/@@images\/e85230f6-8cab-4c1f-9ba6-8041f27aa2c8.jpeg?w=660&ssl=1)\nPhoto: Operation Acolhida disclosure https:\/\/translate.google.com.br\/translate?hl=en&sl=pt&u=https:\/\/www.ecoamazonia.org.br\/2020\/06\/refugiados-venezuelanos-recebem-atendimento-humanitario-brasil\/&prev=search&pto=aue","fc248832":"Venezuela has never had levels of poverty like the one we are seeing, neither in the 20th century nor in the 21st century. That is why we need to leave the Latin American context and, more specifically, the South American context, to put in perspective where they are - says sociologist Luis Pedro Espa\u00f1a, a researcher at the Catholic University Andr\u00e9s Bello, who leads the study.\n\nMissed education: In Venezuela, the educational system goes bankrupt and students pass out from hunger in schools\n\nBy the population's income criterion, 96 per cent of Venezuelans are poor. Among them, 79 per cent are in extreme poverty - that is, the income is not enough to buy a basic food basket. This level of poverty has been registered in the country in the last three years of hyperinflation and, for researchers, it is the result of a 70 per cent drop in GDP between 2013 and 2019.\n\nIn general, they are all poor, there is no wealth to distribute or well-being to enjoy.\nhttps:\/\/translate.google.com.br\/translate?hl=en&sl=pt&u=https:\/\/oglobo.globo.com\/mundo\/venezuela-79-da-populacao-esta-em-extrema-pobreza-mostra-estudo-24521940&prev=search&pto=aue","d184ac0a":"Ending extreme poverty would require a direct transfer program equivalent to US $ 5 billion per year, which would allow giving two dollars a day to 6.5 million families.\n\nThe policy, however, is not viable for the government of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who suffers from the fall in oil production and is involved in a deep political and legitimacy crisis, cornered by international sanctions.\n\nThe State is deeply poor in order to be able to undertake this program and relaunch the economy, and, until we are able to enter the international financial system, they will be mired in precariousness. \nhttps:\/\/translate.google.com.br\/translate?hl=en&sl=pt&u=https:\/\/oglobo.globo.com\/mundo\/venezuela-79-da-populacao-esta-em-extrema-pobreza-mostra-estudo-24521940&prev=search&pto=aue","182bf717":"#Extreme poverty affects almost 80% of Venezuela's population, study shows, by Florantonia Singer, from El Pa\u00eds\n\nFour out of five Venezuelans have no income to buy a basic food basket; by income criteria, 96 per cent of Venezuelans are poor.\n\nVenezuela is no longer a country with standards of living standards in South America. The level of poverty it has reached in recent years, and which has continued to grow between 2019 and 2020, puts the country, which has the largest reserves of world oil , on a different scale. These are the conclusions of the most recent Venezuelan Living Conditions Survey (Encovi, in the Spanish acronym), carried out by a group of universities annually since 2014 and considered the most accurate x-ray of the country's social situation since the government stopped to publish statistics.\n\n\nAfter a decade of oil boom, ended in 2014, today the country is the poorest in the region and the second most unequal - behind only Brazil - according to calculations made from interviews in almost 10,000 households. The data reflects the economic collapse, in addition to the demographic and social adjustment caused by the forced emigration of five million Venezuelans.\nhttps:\/\/translate.google.com.br\/translate?hl=en&sl=pt&u=https:\/\/oglobo.globo.com\/mundo\/venezuela-79-da-populacao-esta-em-extrema-pobreza-mostra-estudo-24521940&prev=search&pto=aue\n\n\nAnalyzing other aspects, such as employment, education, housing conditions and public services, poverty reaches 65% of Venezuelan households - having increased by 13.8% between 2018 and 2019."}}
