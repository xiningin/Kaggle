Now, this 0 Richter earthquake we have to invest further.","3edfa10c":"Now let's try to look at how strong the earthquakes are in the pass of years.

One for the year, one for the month and one for the day. A good idea is to make one column out of these three columns.","26010268":"We have a time span from 1901 to 2018 this is about 118 year of earthquakes, that will be interesting. The month entries are ok (1 - 12) as the day entries (1 - 31), hour and minutes seem to be ok too. The deviation from the LAT and LON seem to be very small, that means that the earthquakes took place around the same region, but that can we prove it later. The magnitude of the earthquakes has a min of 0, that seems not ok as an earthquake of 0 doesn't exist. But the max is 8 Richter, that is quite a shake.","73d36124":"Ok, now we see the map of Greece and more specifically the mean area where the earthquakes took place. Now if we try to plot each entry we will end up to a high computational process and it would be unnecessary, so let's plot only the earthquakes that are bigger or equal 7 Richters. If we make a search in Wikipedia we will see that an earthquake with a magnitude bigger than 6 Richters described as \"strong\". So we decide to plot only the \"strong\" quakes.","78bc6b41":"Now its time to see the GEO features\n\nSometimes making a scatter plot of the features we can see the shape of a location, county, city, etc. Let's try it now to see what happens"}}
