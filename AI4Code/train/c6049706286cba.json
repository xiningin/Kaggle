At first, I wanted to compute the mean and std of the first image and then normalize the whole dataset using it; after all, a CT scan of a lung should be similar to another lung, right? But decided against it and decided that maybe computing the global mean and std might be worth the effort. So I wrote the following code.\n\nWhen I suspect the code is gonna take a long time I insert a print statement somewhere so that I know the code works. I coded the print statement so as to print the mean of images up to the patients that I opened their CT scans. I noticed that the the means starts out high and then goes down up to a negative value then goes up again, and the patern continues as the for loop goes on. I thought there was something wrong with my code.","a9ee89b2":"### Importing the necessary libraries"}}
