Plucking the right data out of our data representation is critical to getting work done.\n\nHowever, the data does not always come in the format we want it. So you'll usually have to reformat it for the task at hand. Fortunately you can build the skills you need for this in the following exercises.\n\nLoad the data and our feedback system by running the following cell.","0ac51c64":"**[Pandas Micro-Course Home Page](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/learn\/pandas)**\n\n---\n"}}
