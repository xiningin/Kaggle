The article was published in March, based on situation in China. Authors predicted that the situation similar to theirs may occure in other countries all over the world. Well, they were right... Authors claimed that measures on the virus from the government would help to curtail the spread. As soon as pandemic has spread, the World Health Organisation released a scientific report on the Off-label use of medicines for COVID-19 [2]. It appears that \"No pharmaceutical products have yet been shown to be safe and effective for the treatment of COVID-19\" as the report states.\n\nThere were different measures taken to slow down the spread of the virus and allow healthcare organisations prepare to fight the virus. The article [3] analazes the real-time mobility data from Wuhan and detailed case data including travel history to estimate the role of case importation in transmission in cities across China and to ascertain the impact of control measures. Authors claim that in the beginning, the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases in China was explained well by human mobility data. After imposing of control measures, this correlation dropped and growth rates became negative in most locations, although shifts in the demographics of reported cases were still indicative of local chains of transmission outside of Wuhan.\n\nNew COVID-19 virus belongs to the same family of viruses as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome or SARS virus, outbreak of which was registered in Guangdong province of southern China in 2002. The authors of [4] conduct a thorough research on the similarities of the two types of viruses in the context of their virus incubation, originations, diagnosis and treatment methods, genomic and proteomic sequences, and pathogenic mechanisms. Their results showed that almost all encoded proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are homologous to SARS-CoV proteins. Another group of authors arrive into same conclusion, as can be understood from [5].\n\nA question arises: if the measures, used to cope with the spread of SARS virus in 2002 in Guangdong, can be applied and be effective towards the new COVID-19 and thus reduce the peak of the cases? The authors of the paper [6] are trying to adress that question. They report that traditional public health measures used during SARS were successful and included active case detection, isolation of cases, contact tracing and quarantine of all contacts, social distancing, and community quarantine. However, the authors arrive to the conclusion that even though two viruses are very alike, the same measures might not be enough to eradicate the pandemic. At the same time, they deem the constraints imposed by governments on people movement and other containing strategies to be neccessary to slow down the peak cases and thus very appropriate for the current situation.\n\nIn [7] authors reviewed the existing litrature on the SARS family viruses and suggeted special measures on diagnosis and potential interventions. Among other measures researchers highlight isolation and early detection and diagnosis along with the tracking of the potential contacts of a patient. This conclusion is supported by the work [8], where authors conducted a simulation study on effects of intervention measures of the COVID-19. Authors specifically mention the enormous burden on the healthcare institutions and recommend the strict control measures help to contain disease from spreading and an early detecting, reporting and fast reacting to control the spread.\n\nThe dataset being analyzed is one of the datasets available on Kaggle platform. As will be seen later, it includes some qualitative features that need to be encoded for the future use in ML models. One of the methods used is \"one hot encoding\" to convert qualitative data into quantative. Authors of [9] used the same technique in one of the steps of their framework for diagnosing COVID-19 in X-Ray Images using deep learning classifiers, called COVIDX-Net.\n\nAnother technique implemented on that dataset is Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency technique. It is applied to the \"comments\" part of the dataset. The same approach was used in [10] to understand emotional responses to COVID-19. Authors conclude that emotional responses correlated with linguistic measures.","6372270e":"Plotting using plotly","90021410":"lets plot that using pie chart for better visualization","487ba7e1":"## Reported measures by country\n\nFirst we will look which countries are present in dataset and count their occurences","fc24e516":"Calling vectorizer on our dataset of comments","d596eab8":"Out of first 20 n_grams we would select the ones that make most sence for a human (this is strictly subjective procedure, opinions may differ):","8c8bcdf4":"Now we will transform the \"bag of words\" matrix into tf-idf matrix.\n\ntf-idf means term-frequency times inverse document-frequency. This is a common term weighting scheme in information retrieval, that has also found good use in document classification.\n\nThe formula that is used to compute the tf-idf for a term t of a document d in a document set is tf-idf(t, d) = tf(t, d) * idf(t), and the idf is computed as idf(t) = log [ n \/ df(t) ] + 1, where n is the total number of documents in the document set and df(t) is the document frequency of t; the document frequency is the number of documents in the document set that contain the term t. The effect of adding \u201c1\u201d to the idf in the equation above is that terms with zero idf, i.e., terms that occur in all documents in a training set, will not be entirely ignored."}}
