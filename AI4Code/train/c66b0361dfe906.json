Large enough to enhance the tendency of a model to overfit (as low as 10 variables might cause overfitting)\n2. Large enough to cause computational challenges. With modern systems, this situation might arise in case of millions or billions of features\nThough Ridge and Lasso might appear to work towards a common goal, the inherent properties and practical use cases differ substantially. If you\u2019ve heard of them before, you must know that they work by penalizing the magnitude of coefficients of features along with minimizing the error between predicted and actual observations. These are called \u2018regularization\u2019 techniques. The key difference is in how they assign penalty to the coefficients:\n\n### Ridge Regression:\nPerforms L2 regularization, i.e. adds penalty equivalent to square of the magnitude of coefficients\nMinimization objective = LS Obj + \u03b1 * (sum of square of coefficients)\n### Lasso Regression:\nPerforms L1 regularization, i.e. adds penalty equivalent to absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients\nMinimization objective = LS Obj + \u03b1 * (sum of absolute value of coefficients)\nNote that here \u2018LS Obj\u2019 refers to \u2018least squares objective\u2019, i.e. the linear regression objective without regularization.\n\n#### For Further Reference: https:\/\/www.analyticsvidhya.com\/blog\/2016\/01\/complete-tutorial-ridge-lasso-regression-python\/","634bfc15":"Table of Content:\n\n<a href=\"#data_handling\">1.

They require all input variables and output variables to be numeric.\n\nIn general, this is mostly a constraint of the efficient implementation of machine learning algorithms rather than hard limitations on the algorithms themselves.\n\nThis means that categorical data must be converted to a numerical form. If the categorical variable is an output variable, you may also want to convert predictions by the model back into a categorical form in order to present them or use them in some application.\n\n\n","41346034":"# 3.

One-Hot Encoding\nFor categorical variables where no such ordinal relationship exists, the integer encoding is not enough.\n\nIn fact, using this encoding and allowing the model to assume a natural ordering between categories may result in poor performance or unexpected results (predictions halfway between categories).\n\nIn this case, a one-hot encoding can be applied to the integer representation. This is where the integer encoded variable is removed and a new binary variable is added for each unique integer value.\n\nIn the \u201ccolor\u201d variable example, there are 3 categories and therefore 3 binary variables are needed. A \u201c1\u201d value is placed in the binary variable for the color and \u201c0\u201d values for the other colors.\n\n\nFor further reference : https:\/\/machinelearningmastery.com\/why-one-hot-encode-data-in-machine-learning\/","ef7e6e0d":"1.

The first step involves estimating the coefficient of the independent variable and then measuring the reliability of the estimated coefficient. This requires formulating a hypothesis, and based on the hypothesis, we can create a function.\n\nIf a manager wants to determine the relationship between the firm\u2019s advertisement expenditures and its sales revenue, he will undergo the test of hypothesis. Assuming that higher advertising expenditures lead to higher sale for a firm. The manager collects data on advertising expenditure and on sales revenue in a specific period of time. This hypothesis can be translated into the mathematical function, where it leads to \u2212\n\n### Y = A + Bx\n\nWhere Y is sales, x is the advertisement expenditure, A and B are constant.\n\nAfter translating the hypothesis into the function, the basis for this is to find the relationship between the dependent and independent variables. The value of dependent variable is of most importance to researchers and depends on the value of other variables. Independent variable is used to explain the variation in the dependent variable. It can be classified into two types \u2212\n\n1. Simple regression \u2212 One independent variable\n\n2. Multiple regression \u2212 Several independent variables\n\n1. Simple Regression\nFollowing are the steps to build up regression analysis \u2212\n\nSpecify the regression model\nObtain data on variables\nEstimate the quantitative relationships\nTest the statistical significance of the results\nUsage of results in decision-making\nFormula for simple regression is \u2212\n\n### Y = a + bX + u\n\nY= dependent variable\n\nX= independent variable\n\na= intercept\n\nb= slope\n\nu= random factor\n\nCross sectional data provides information on a group of entities at a given time, whereas time series data provides information on one entity over time. When we estimate regression equation it involves the process of finding out the best linear relationship between the dependent and the independent variables.\n\n## Method of Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)\nOrdinary least square method is designed to fit a line through a scatter of points is such a way that the sum of the squared deviations of the points from the line is minimized. It is a statistical method. Usually Software packages perform OLS estimation.\n\n### Y = a + bX\n\n## Co-efficient of Determination (R2)\nCo-efficient of determination is a measure which indicates the percentage of the variation in the dependent variable is due to the variations in the independent variables. R2 is a measure of the goodness of fit model. Following are the methods \u2212\n\n## Total Sum of Squares (TSS)\nSum of the squared deviations of the sample values of Y from the mean of Y.\n\n### TSS = SUM ( Yi \u2212 Y)2\n\nYi = dependent variables\n\nY = mean of dependent variables\n\ni = number of observations\n\n## Regression Sum of Squares (RSS)\nSum of the squared deviations of the estimated values of Y from the mean of Y.\n\n### RSS = SUM ( \u1ef6i \u2212 uY)2\n\n\u1ef6i = estimated value of Y\n\nY = mean of dependent variables\n\ni = number of variations\n\n## Error Sum of Squares (ESS)\nSum of the squared deviations of the sample values of Y from the estimated values of Y.\n\n### ESS = SUM ( Yi \u2212 \u1ef6i)2\n\n\u1ef6i = estimated value of Y\n\nYi = dependent variables\n\ni = number of observations\n\n\n","01e1b3f3":"## 2.1.
