A leaky ReLU is like a normal ReLU, except that there is a small non-zero output for negative input values.\n\n\n#### Sigmoid Output\n\nWe'll also take the approach of using a more numerically stable loss function on the outputs. Recall that we want the discriminator to output a value 0-1 indicating whether an image is _real or fake_. \n> We will ultimately use [BCEWithLogitsLoss](https:\/\/pytorch.org\/docs\/stable\/nn.html#bcewithlogitsloss), which combines a `sigmoid` activation function **and** and binary cross entropy loss in one function. \n\nSo, our final output layer should not have any activation function applied to it.","0e9a6239":"# Generative Adversarial Network\n\nIn this notebook, we'll be building a generative adversarial network (GAN) trained on the MNIST dataset. From this, we'll be able to generate new handwritten digits!\n\nGANs were [first reported on](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1406.2661) in 2014 from Ian Goodfellow and others in Yoshua Bengio's lab. Since then, GANs have exploded in popularity. Here are a few examples to check out:\n\n* [Pix2Pix](https:\/\/affinelayer.com\/pixsrv\/) \n* [CycleGAN & Pix2Pix in PyTorch, Jun-Yan Zhu](https:\/\/github.com\/junyanz\/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix)\n* [A list of generative models](https:\/\/github.com\/wiseodd\/generative-models)\n\nThe idea behind GANs is that you have two networks, a generator $G$ and a discriminator $D$, competing against each other. The generator makes \"fake\" data to pass to the discriminator. The discriminator also sees real training data and predicts if the data it's received is real or fake. \n> * The generator is trained to fool the discriminator, it wants to output data that looks _as close as possible_ to real, training data. \n* The discriminator is a classifier that is trained to figure out which data is real and which is fake. \n\nWhat ends up happening is that the generator learns to make data that is indistinguishable from real data to the discriminator.\n\n\n\nThe general structure of a GAN is shown in the diagram above, using MNIST images as data. The latent sample is a random vector that the generator uses to construct its fake images. This is often called a **latent vector** and that vector space is called **latent space**. As the generator trains, it figures out how to map latent vectors to recognizable images that can fool the discriminator.\n\nIf you're interested in generating only new images, you can throw out the discriminator after training. In this notebook, I'll show you how to define and train these adversarial networks in PyTorch and generate new images!","7e7355c2":"These are samples from the final training epoch. You can see the generator is able to reproduce numbers like 1, 7, 3, 2. Since this is just a sample, it isn't representative of the full range of images this generator can make.","22fc4234":"---\n## Training\n\nTraining will involve alternating between training the discriminator and the generator. We'll use our functions `real_loss` and `fake_loss` to help us calculate the discriminator losses in all of the following cases.\n\n### Discriminator training\n1. Compute the discriminator loss on real, training images        \n2. Generate fake images\n3. Compute the discriminator loss on fake, generated images     \n4. Add up real and fake loss\n5. Perform backpropagation + an optimization step to update the discriminator's weights\n\n### Generator training\n1. Generate fake images\n2. Compute the discriminator loss on fake images, using **flipped** labels!\n3. Perform backpropagation + an optimization step to update the generator's weights\n\n#### Saving Samples\n\nAs we train, we'll also print out some loss statistics and save some generated \"fake\" samples.","b3c369e8":"### Visualize the data","f33cbc50":"---\n# Define the Model\n\nA GAN is comprised of two adversarial networks, a discriminator and a generator.","97dc8cc9":"## Build complete network\n\nNow we're instantiating the discriminator and generator from the classes defined above.

You can start to see some number like structures appear out of the noise like 1s and 9s.","65bc0f5f":"## Discriminator and Generator Losses\n\nNow we need to calculate the losses. \n\n### Discriminator Losses\n\n> * For the discriminator, the total loss is the sum of the losses for real and fake images, `d_loss = d_real_loss + d_fake_loss`. \n* Remember that we want the discriminator to output 1 for real images and 0 for fake images, so we need to set up the losses to reflect that.\n\n\nThe losses will by binary cross entropy loss with logits, which we can get with [BCEWithLogitsLoss](https:\/\/pytorch.org\/docs\/stable\/nn.html#bcewithlogitsloss). This combines a `sigmoid` activation function **and** and binary cross entropy loss in one function.\n\nFor the real images, we want `D(real_images) = 1`. That is, we want the discriminator to classify the the real images with a label = 1, indicating that these are real. To help the discriminator generalize better, the labels are **reduced a bit from 1.0 to 0.9**. For this, we'll use the parameter `smooth`; if True, then we should smooth our labels. In PyTorch, this looks like `labels = torch.ones(size) * 0.9`\n\nThe discriminator loss for the fake data is similar. We want `D(fake_images) = 0`, where the fake images are the _generator output_, `fake_images = G(z)`. \n\n### Generator Loss\n\nThe generator loss will look similar only with flipped labels. The generator's goal is to get `D(fake_images) = 1`. In this case, the labels are **flipped** to represent that the generator is trying to fool the discriminator into thinking that the images it generates (fakes) are real!"}}
