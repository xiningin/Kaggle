Some of them refer to simple values, like `math.pi`:","99d2455a":"Wouldn't it be great if we could refer to all the variables in the `math` module by themselves? i.e. if we could just refer to `pi` instead of `math.pi` or `mt.pi`? Good news: we can do that.","6fc99844":"### Other import syntax\n\nIf we know we'll be using functions in `math` frequently we can import it under a shorter alias to save some typing (though in this case \"math\" is already pretty short).","9501d2ed":"# Oh the places you'll go, oh the objects you'll see\n\nSo after 6 lessons, you're a pro with ints, floats, bools, lists, strings, and dicts (right?). \n\nEven if that were true, it doesn't end there. As you work with various libraries for specialized tasks, you'll find that they define their own types which you'll have to learn to work with. For example, if you work with the graphing library `matplotlib`, you'll be coming into contact with objects it defines which represent Subplots, Figures, TickMarks, and Annotations. `pandas` functions will give you DataFrames and Series. \n\nIn this section, I want to share with you a quick survival guide for working with strange types.\n\n## Three tools for understanding strange objects\n\nIn the cell above, we saw that calling a `numpy` function gave us an \"array\". We've never seen anything like this before (not in this course anyways). But don't panic: we have three familiar builtin functions to help us here.\n\n**1: `type()`** (what is this thing?)","695964a0":"(Of course, you might also prefer to check out [the online docs](https:\/\/docs.scipy.org\/doc\/numpy-1.14.0\/reference\/generated\/numpy.ndarray.html))","bc46e6ba":"This turns out to be directly related to operator overloading.\n\nWhen Python programmers want to define how operators behave on their types, they do so by implementing methods with special names beginning and ending with 2 underscores such as `__lt__`, `__setattr__`, or `__contains__`. Generally, names that follow this double-underscore format have a special meaning to Python.\n\nSo, for example, the expression `x in [1, 2, 3]` is actually calling the list method `__contains__` behind-the-scenes. It's equivalent to (the much uglier) `[1, 2, 3].__contains__(x)`. \n\nIf you're curious to learn more, you can check out [Python's official documentation](https:\/\/docs.python.org\/3.4\/reference\/datamodel.html#special-method-names), which describes many, many more of these special \"underscores\" methods.\n\nWe won't be defining our own types in these lessons (if only there was time!), but I hope you'll get to experience the joys of defining your own wonderful, weird types later down the road.","618f44ca":"`a + b` isn't 2, it is (to quote tensorflow's documentation)...\n\n> a symbolic handle to one of the outputs of an `Operation`. It does not hold the values of that operation's output, but instead provides a means of computing those values in a TensorFlow `tf.Session`.\n\n","b5d5930f":"We can also call `help()` on the module itself. This will give us the combined documentation for *all* the functions and values in the module (as well as a high-level description of the module). Click the \"output\" button to see the whole `math` help page.","5c431c8c":"We might think that Python strictly polices how pieces of its core syntax behave such as `+`, `<`, `in`, `==`, or square brackets for indexing and slicing. But in fact, it takes a very hands-off approach. When you define a new type, you can choose how addition works for it, or what it means for an object of that type to be equal to something else.\n\nThe designers of lists decided that adding them to numbers wasn't allowed. The designers of `numpy` arrays went a different way (adding the number to each element of the array).\n\nHere are a few more examples of how `numpy` arrays interact unexpectedly with Python operators (or at least differently from lists).","6fe273bf":"`import *` makes all the module's variables directly accessible to you (without any dotted prefix).\n\nBad news: some purists might grumble at you for doing this.\n\nWorse: they kind of have a point.","c3b04102":"But most of what we'll find in the module are functions, like `math.log`:","7ff04c05":"> You may have seen code that does this with certain popular libraries like Pandas, Numpy, Tensorflow, or Matplotlib. For example, it's a common convention to `import numpy as np` and `import pandas as pd`.","74090fba":"numpy's `ndarray` type is specialized for working with multi-dimensional data, so it defines its own logic for indexing, allowing us to index by a tuple to specify the index at each dimension.\n\n### When does 1 + 1 not equal 2?\n\nThings can get weirder than this. You may have heard of (or even used) tensorflow, a Python library popularly used for deep learning. It makes extensive use of operator overloading.","04d7cb1f":"### Submodules\n\nWe've seen that modules contain variables which can refer to functions or values. Something to be aware of is that they can also have variables referring to *other modules*. ","a9bbc133":"**3: `help()`** (tell me more)","41d2c31b":"`math` is a module. A module is just a collection of variables (a *namespace*, if you like) defined by someone else.

Of course it's an error. \n\nBut what about...","198433f0":"What the what? But it worked before!\n\nThese kinds of \"star imports\" can occasionally lead to weird, difficult-to-debug situations.\n\nThe problem in this case is that the `math` and `numpy` modules both have functions called `log`, but they have different semantics. Because we import from `numpy` second, its `log` overwrites (or \"shadows\") the `log` variable we imported from `math`.\n\nA good compromise is to import only the specific things we'll need from each module:","882119a5":"## Imports\n\nSo far we've talked about types and functions which are built-in to the language. \n\nBut one of the best things about Python (especially if you're a data scientist) is the vast number of high-quality custom libraries that have been written for it. \n\nSome of these libraries are in the \"standard library\", meaning you can find them anywhere you run Python. Others libraries can be easily added, even if they aren't always shipped with Python.\n\nEither way, we'll access this code with **imports**.\n\nWe'll start our example by importing `math` from the standard library.","5241436b":"The `as` simply renames the imported module. It's equivalent to doing something like:","d568c4cc":"#### Curious how it all works?\n\nHave you ever called `help()` or `dir()` on an object and wondered what the heck all those names with the double-underscores were?","9d8a4ee2":"# Your turn!\n\nHead over to [the very last Exercises notebook](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/kernels\/fork\/1164833) for one more round of coding questions involving imports, working with unfamiliar objects, and, of course, more gambling.","0060a2b1":"Of course, if we don't know what `math.log` does, we can call `help()` on it:"}}
