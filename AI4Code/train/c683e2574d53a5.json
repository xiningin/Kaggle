This indiscriminate cutting can be successful in some occasions, but not always, that is why we affirm that this an approach that offers some limitations. ex) studying -> study, studied -> studi <br>\n<br>\n- __Lemmatization:__ Lemmatization is the process of converting the words of a sentence to its dictionary form. For example, given the words amusement, amusing, and amused, the lemma for each and all would be amuse. ex) studying -> study, studied -> study. Lemmatization also discerns the meaning of the word by understanding the context of a passage. For example, if a \"meet\" is used as a noun then it will print out a \"meeting\"; however, if it is used as a verb then it will print out \"meet\".  \n<br>\n\nUsually, either one of them is chosen for text-analysis not both. As a side note, Lancaster is the most aggressive stemmer among three major stemming algorithms (Porter, Snowball, Lancaster) and Porter is the least aggressive. The \"aggressive algorithms\" means how much a working set of words are reduced. The more aggressive the algorithms, the faster it is; however, in some certain circumstances, it will hugely trim down your working set.

It is simply the matrix that counts how many each word appears in documents (disregard grammar and word order). In order to do that, we use \"CountVectorizer\" method in sklearn library. As you know already, the number of vocabulary is very large so it is important to limit the size of the feature vectors. In this project, we use the 18000 most frequent words. Also, the other things to notice is that we set min_df = 2 and ngram_range = (1,3). min_df = 2 means in order to include the vocabulary in the matrix, one word must appear in at least two documents. ngram_range means we cut one sentence by number of ngram. Let's say we have one sentence, I am a boy. If we cut the sentence by digram (ngram=2) then the sentence would be cut like this [\"I am\",\"am a\", \"a boy\"].
