All user data with encryption or more data on developing countries, so we can do statistics.\n    2. Please organize more **real world problems in a large scale**. By doing so, show developing countries to decide their problems in the data-driven way.\n    3. etc...\n\n\n## Conclusion\n","f75ff721":"# Kaggle in Mongolia \ud83c\uddf2\ud83c\uddf3\n\nFirst of all, I want to thank the Kaggle for making so much easier to learn the Data Science hands-on!\n\nIn this competition, I wanted to answer those two questions:\n* How is Kaggle helping Mongolia? (even if the number of active Kagglers are so small) \n* What we can do about it?\n\nAND here we go!","1f884ae7":"## How is Kaggle helping Mongolia?\nPoints:\n* You cannot say anything about \"How is Kaggle helping Mongolia\" from **this competition data**.\n* But for me, it is doing quite well <3 ! \u2b06\ufe0f\n\nMongolian Kagglers really care about their community, even though it is so small.\n\nRecently, Machine Learning UB (MLUB) organized the in-class competition among Mongolian Kagglers and it took place really quickly and almost **every data science related** people participated! The competition solution helped Mongolians to understand its one of the biggest challenges: `air pollution` and will be deployed in the air pollution index tracking application.","076781ed":"[*source](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/ulaanbaatar-city-air-pollution-prediction)\n\n> There were 71 participants competed, which for me it is great number and, in fact, they were not just hanging there, but really pushing competition to next level.\n\nFrom here, let's say if the number of active DS people in Mongolia is ~100, \n\n**So we CANNOT say anything about it from this survey.**\n\n========= Why?! ========\n\nEven the number of all participants of the survey is **13.3%**(20037\/150238) of all the Kagglers. [*source](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/rankings?group=competitions&page=1&pageSize=20)","77dfe654":"\n> Imagine participating competition where 13% of data is in the public leader board, you cannot evaluate your solution by \"Public Leader Score\".\n\nBack to Mongolian case, there could just above ten people (13 percent of around 100 people) can be in this survey.\n\n\n## What we can do about it?\n\n* Before that, **what have we done?**\n\n     I think Kaggle Days Meetup doing great things in this. Recently, they made their [debut in Mongolia](https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/posts\/kaggle-days_kaggle-days-meetup-ulaanbaatar-1-activity-6730037203159855104-QT8B) and inspired a lot Kagglers in Mongolia.\n     \n","b85be67d":"\nIn this notebook, I tried to show how guys in Mongolia keep improving themselves using Kaggle and what can be done from Kaggle's side to make it more visible for developing countries.\n\n- In this competition, more `transparency` needed for developing countries in order to do Data Science.\n- Keep up MLUB and Kaggle Days Meetup!\n\n\n### References:\n* [Machine Learning UB](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/machinelearningub)\n* [Ulaanbaatar City Air Pollution Prediction](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/ulaanbaatar-city-air-pollution-prediction)\n* [Kaggle Days Meetup debut in Mongolia](https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/posts\/kaggle-days_kaggle-days-meetup-ulaanbaatar-1-activity-6730037203159855104-QT8B)\n* [Kaggle Ranking Page](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/rankings?group=competitions&page=1&pageSize=20)\n* [Kagge Survey 2020](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/kaggle-survey-2020)"}}
