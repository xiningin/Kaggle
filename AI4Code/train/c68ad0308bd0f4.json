Today, the country is the second in the region with the most cases (395 thousand) and deaths (18,612), behind only Brazil.\n\nThe prolonged confinement,  which started in mid-March, after the first reported case - was a blow to the economy of a country that, before the pandemic, had been growing above the Latin American average. GDP fell 17 per cent in the first five months of the year and more than 2.6 million jobs were lost, according to official data. Among the factors that explain the sharp drop is the high rate of informality, which reaches 70 per cent - and led to strong pressure to end the quarantine.\n\nThe high level of informality, which led many young people to work on the streets despite the confinement, a number of other factors, such as the precarious health system and disinformation, contributed to the worsening of the health crisis in the country.\n\nThe pandemic has reinforced structural health problems. There is a historic gap in the primary care system that cannot be resolved in four months. In addition, one in five households in the countryside lack basic services, such as water. In addition to the high level of informal work, especially among young people, the high displacement of workers helped to spread the pandemic, with the creation of so-called risk corridors. https:\/\/translate.google.com.br\/translate?hl=en&sl=pt&u=https:\/\/oglobo.globo.com\/mundo\/suplica-de-mulher-presidente-peruano-vira-simbolo-do-avanco-da-pandemia-no-pais-24556588&prev=search&pto=aue","35891876":"Das War's Kaggle Notebook Runner: mar\u00edlia Prata  @mpwolke","aeec10eb":"In addition, the adoption of experimental measures to deal with the disease, such as the contested restriction of movement of people by gender on alternate days, which caused more crowds - historically it is women who shop - and lasted less than 15 days. Since March, when the pandemic began, the country has had three health ministers.\n\nWhenever a minister causes some noise in the government, he is replaced.\n\nThe new program, \"Acelera Peru\" , will generate one million jobs and will start in August. And yet the President promised, perhaps  the creation of an \"orphan's pension\" of about R $ 300 per month for children up to the age of majority whose parents died from Covid-19.\n\nReactivation is a national objective, there is no health without an economy - said the president, in an almost empty Congress, in a speech broadcast on television. - The quarantine saved many lives. \n\nhttps:\/\/translate.google.com.br\/translate?hl=en&sl=pt&u=https:\/\/oglobo.globo.com\/mundo\/suplica-de-mulher-presidente-peruano-vira-simbolo-do-avanco-da-pandemia-no-pais-24556588&prev=search&pto=aue","19edf0ff":"![](https:\/\/static.soundsandcolours.com\/2020\/05\/cancion-al-covid19-768x432.jpg)\nIn a continent world-renowned for its music, it\u2019s no surprise that musicians across Latin American countries are using it as a weapon to fight the pandemic in the form of humour, escapism, entertainment and encouraging their fans to stay put during this time of great uncertainty.
