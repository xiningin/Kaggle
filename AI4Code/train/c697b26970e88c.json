The dataset for this problem is taken from: https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/mirichoi0218\/insurance\n\n\nWe will create a model with the following steps:\n1. Download and explore the dataset\n2. Prepare the dataset for training\n3. Create a linear regression model\n4. Train the model to fit the data\n5. Make predictions using the trained model\n\n\nThis assignment builds upon the concepts from the first 2 lectures.
