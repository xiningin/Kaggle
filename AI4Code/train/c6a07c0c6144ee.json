suicide compared to others.\n\nThis makes sense because most of the Indian farmers have debt and their life depends on the yield of their crops, if the yield is not good then they will not be able to clear their debt and in the worst case they might commit suicide.\n\n> Global warming, monsoon delay, drought etc can lead to bad yield.\n\nHousewives might have issues in their marriage which this might be a reason for such a high number of cases.\n> Domestic violence, dowry, gender discrimination, etc might be some of the reasons for housewives to commit suicide.","3cd78e3b":"# Suicide
