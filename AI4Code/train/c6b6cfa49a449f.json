However, species 23 has a high number of occurences, so we need to probe further.","8ae0dd5d":"**Inference**\n\nThere is a huge difference between the songtype id's. Class 1 has about 1000+ counts while class 4 has about 150 or so.\nThis might create a problem for models.","ba8768ac":"Tried plotting some plots to see the frequency distributions.","2d9e4d9d":"# Species Audio Detection -Aim\nThe dataset consists of data for a lot of species in a forest. We are to predict the species present in a particular audio file. In this kernel, we will be analysing the data and trying to create an initial model.\n\nSources:\n* [Kernel by Bojan Tunguz](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/tunguz\/rainforest-rapids-baseline)","b03b7af5":"# EDA"}}
