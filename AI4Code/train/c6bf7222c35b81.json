In Kannur, LDF is vastly at an advantage and in Malappuram the UDF is the one far ahead. Kasargode and Wayanad are very closely fought between the two alliances. The unexpected trend is that in the four districts where the NDA made headway ie. Palakkad, Pathanamthitta, Thrissur and Thiruvananthapuram, their progress is at the expense of UDF. In these four districts, the gap between the UDF and LDF is much higher than usual due to the gains of NDA.","496e51b5":"The northern constituencies saw the least protest votes in this cycle","f3d736fe":"## Checking which alliance won more seats\n\nNo surprises here. LDF won 99 and UDF won 41, as we saw on the election day","077f3416":"Another interesting aspect is that 0.46% of votes cast were protest votes (NOTA- None of the above). In some closely fought constituencies, NOTA had a spoiler role","7fd0f450":"The UDF performed well in their strongholds of Malappuram, Eranadu, Piravam and Kottayam as expected. In Karunagapally the rise in vote share was surprising","fd3efc54":"Here we can see the number of seats won by the alliances in each district","164b92d9":"NDA performed poorly in Malappuram, Kothamanagalam and Poonjar as expected","6766228c":"As expected in the Kannur based constituencies of Payyannur, Mattannur, Thalassery and Kalliassery the performance of the LDF was exceptional with over 60% voteshare. Udumbanchola was a predictable contest but the margin was surprising","e269559a":"## Looking at the most and least competitive races in each district\n\nHere we can see that each district had some close races and some easily predictable victories","76b3821a":"The most brutally one-sided victories came in the Kannur district by the LDF. The Chief minister and Health minister each received a lead of over 50000 votes and vote shares of 60%. Chelakkara was also a surprisingly convincing victory","90726337":"## Looking at the mean vote share of the major alliances\n\nLDF won over 45% of the votes polled in the whole of Kerala, beating the usual anti-incumbency sentiment seen in Kerala in every election cycle","7c4f7fdd":"UDF won more than 39% of the votes polled in the whole of Kerala, but the votes were mostly concentrated in some districts- leading to their dismal performance","3a7da25a":"The protest votes were high in the following seats- perhaps due to some voters dissatisifed by their party's ticket candidate","d809e13e":"UDF did very well in Malappuram (12\/16 seats), Wayanad (2\/3 seats) and Ernakulam (9\/14 seats)","2cbc40ae":"## Loading data","b092bc31":"The UDF fared poorly in Malambuzha, Kazhakkoottam and Shornur due to the gains of the NDA. In Mattannur, their performance was overshadowed by a strong improvement of vote share by the LDF. In Poonjar, the presence of a strong third party candidate dampened the hopes of the UDF","3a8c2efd":"The NDA gave a strong fight in the Manjeswaram constituency, succumbing to a 745 vote loss. They performed well at Nemom, but lost a bit of their vote share from the previous cycle and lost that seat which was the only one they held previously. Palakkad and Thrissur were marked by high profile candidates, which helped their cause. Kasargode was another good performance from them in this cycle","78235029":"## Constituencies with highest and lowest vote shares\n\nLDF fared poorly in the Kasargode, Manjeswaram, Palakkad, Vengara and Ernakulam constituencies. In Kasargode, Manjeswaram, Palakkad and Ernakulam this is due to the gains of the NDA and in Vengara the UDF improved their vote share","6daca5a8":"NDA fared better than their average of 12% vote share in Kasargode, Thiruvananthapuram, Pathanamthitta, Thrissur, Palakkad and Alappuzha but did not pose a significant challenge to the other alliances","de2b9ddf":"NDA was expected to improve their vote share but they dropped to just over 12% in this election cycle as opposed to the pre-poll predictions of 15%+","14b2a6d7":"The closest contest in this cycle was in Perinthalmanna, decided by merely 38 votes. Other closely fought battles were in Kuttiady, Manjeswaram, Thrissur and Tanur. Thrissur had the distinction of being the closest 3-way race in this election as well","e4e33e92":"## District-wise voteshare of the major alliances\n\nLDF did very well in Kannur (9\/11 seats), Thrissur (12\/13 seats), Idukki (4\/5 seats) and Palakkad (10\/12 seats)","b103f463":"Here we can see that the voteshare of NOTA was lowest in Kozhikode (0.32%) and highest in Wayanad (0.58%). The average vote share of 0.46% was exceeded in Ernakulam, Idukki, Kannur, Palakkad, Thrissur, Thiruvananthapuram and Wayanad"}}
