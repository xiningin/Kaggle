All suggestions, improvements, ideas, questions and queries are well come.\nThe signal is sum of sinusoidal wave, other interfering waves, random disturbances and measurement noise. The sinusoidal wave is the indented signal and rest is deviations from various sources. One of the sources is fault on line. Using superimposition of wave theory we can subtract the sinusoidal wave from signal and get all deviation. From the difference in faulty and non-faulty residuals we can get patterns exhibited by fault.\nTo reach this goal, we divide it following sub tasks,\n1.\tSmooth the signal so we can fit sine wave\n2.\tFit the sine wave\n3.\tCalculated residual\n4.\tCompare some good and faulty signals in term of residuals.\n\nThe optimize library from scipy is used for sine wave fitting. The find_peak function from scipy.signal is used to identify peaks and Kmeans from sklearn.cluster is used for clustering those peaks. The smooth function denoises data and sine_func implements the sine function.\n","055c8366":"Now getting residul is very easy. Just substract the fitted sine wave from raw data.

Other parameters are known from context we need to find out phase. I will discuss the sine equation and other parameters while fitting sine wave. Now we focus on phase. Phase is the position of a point in time on a waveform cycle.(Further reference https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Phase_(waves) ) We estimate the phase  by locating the positive peak. To identify peaks we use find_peaks method from scipy.signal library. We specify width to avoid sudden fluctuations and smaller peaks."}}
