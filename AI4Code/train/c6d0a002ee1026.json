Notice how multiple faces, masks and frame indexes are serialized.","1b79a42b":"**predictions**\n\nThe last section details my approach to predictions. A couple of things worth noting. First off, the determination of a video's classification from potentially multiple faces from multiple frames was not as straightforward as simply taking the average of all of the predictions for a given video. The predictions roll up from a face detected in a frame through multiple frames and ultimately lead to a prediction for a video. I ended up pulling faces from 16 frames per video and then deciding that a video would be predicted as fake if at least three faces were predicted as such with a probability of at least 80%. I then converted that back into a probability that a video was fake for purposes of the log loss evaluation by dividing the actual number of faces over 80% by 4.5, such that a video with three frames over the 80% threshold would be considered to be fake with 67% probability and a video with 1 face over 80% would be considered to have a 22% probability of being fake.\n\nI only provide predictions for the segmentation model. Again, I couldn't make the results work, but the predictions are really cool in a lot of cases, highlighting where the faces are fake in addition to predicting whether the video is fake.\n\n**results and key learnings**\n\nThe best leaderboard score I could produce was in excess of 0.5. I was really committed to not just copying kernels with better scores and running them, but really building my own pipelines and models. I would do this differently going forward.\n\nI tried a ton of different models and datasets. I tried tightly cropped faces versus loosely cropped and even whole frame models. I tried single frame models with only one fake video per original. I tried overweighting the real videos. I tried sequences of frames from short durations of the videos as well as spread throughout the videos. I tried different pretrained weights, including vggface, vggface2 and imagenet. I tried different cnn models, from Resnet50 to different Efficientnets. I tried training my own version of an Efficientnet model on the vggface2 dataset. I tried large batch sizes, small batch sizes, freezing weights and unfreezing weights. I could never seem to make anything produce a good validation result.\n\nOn the one hand, all of those iterations were incredibly useful in just learning how to go from raw data to training a model and making predictions. On the other hand, clearly other people were figuring out how to make models work. There were obviously things I was missing or doing incorrectly that were preventing me from achieving good results. With that in mind, here is what I would have done differently in hindsight.\n\n1. I would have taken a **hybrid approach to learning from other kernels**, taking down the ones with better scores, really dissecting them to understand how they were working, and then endeavoring to recreate my own versions, especially as a novice.\n2. I would have spent more time **making sure that I had a really good validation set**. I used a couple of simplistic splits early on and then someone else's cluster analysis to approximate actor mutual exclusivity, but I was never really confident that I had a great validation set. Consequently as I was training models and watching validation results closely, I always had some doubt about whether I could trust them. Given the number of decision to make, it is really important to be able to trust your validation results, especially given the limit of two leaderboard submissions per day.\n3. I would do **more testing of my data pipeline**. There was a lot going on between the mp4 video files and the batches of training examples being fed into the models. My initial operating procedure was to write the code for the dataset that I wanted to create, then print out a few batches and if they looked basically right, send them through the model. That obviously leaves a lot of uncertainty as to whether the data that you think is running through the model is actually running through the model. Later in my develop cycle, I started doing more quantitative testing. Real-fake, original video and actor distribution within the dataset all ended up being important considerations, so I would cycle through the dataset to check the actual distribution within batches and across the entire dataset. The pipeline itself also had a lot of moving parts, that frequently broke as I was adding new features and trying new ideas. Having something akin to unit tests would have been much more efficient in the end.\n4. I would **try joining a team**. Going it alone is obviously beneficial from the standpoint of learning by having to do everything, but as a complete novice, there is a ton to learn and being able to learn some of the basics from people who have done it successfully before is ultimately likely a much faster way to get up the learning curve.","c69980cd":"[Tfrecords](https:\/\/www.tensorflow.org\/tutorials\/load_data\/tfrecord) are serialized records of training examples that are used to create datasets that can be read super efficiently by the TPUs from cloud storage. They are essentially serialized dicts of training examples that get read and parsed to create datasets. Tensorflow recommended creating multiple approximately 150MB files so that they could be read in parallel.\n\nThe features have to be stored as lists of either `tf.int64`, `tf.float32` or `tf.string`. The cool thing was that it was possible to store multiple frames or faces in each record and then specify how many to read back at dataset creation time. This made it possible to run both single frame and sequence models from the same dataset.\n\nI also stored the run length encoding of the mask for each of the fake video faces so that segmentation models could be run from the same set of tfrecords.\n\nTo create the tfrecords, I got all of the bounding boxes for all of the original videos using [facenet-pytorch](https:\/\/github.com\/timesler\/facenet-pytorch), stored them in a dataframe and then looped through each of the corresponding fake videos to grab the faces from them.\n\nI also used a modified version of `imutils` `FileVideoStream` class to to pull video frames that took either a number of frames or a list of indexes of the frames to speed things up by not reading all of the frames in each video. Another time saver was setting the bounding boxes up to use the boxes from the nearest frame for which a bounding box had previously been detected.","864c3762":"### Update Dataset","6532103b":"Likewise, this is also a simple implementation to demonstrate how the datasets can be configured from the same tfrecord files to train a sequence model.

I wasn't able to create a model on my own that produced a good leaderboard score. I did, however, learn a ton about creating data pipelines, Tensorflow and TPUs and trained a lot of models. In an effort to solidify my learnings and in hopes of passing along something useful from my trials and tribulations, this book provides a few details on my approach to key parts of the challenge.\n\nI thought using TPUs would potentially be a competitive advantage in this competition given the large size of the dataset. Thank you Google for the generous grant, which once getting past the learning curve of tfrecords, definitely led to faster training and idea-iteration.\n\n**training and validation splits**\n\nDeveloping good training and validation datasets were important elements of this challenge. I tried to develop a training set comprised of correctly labeled faces, meaning that if they were labeled as fake, they in fact had altereed pixels in them (I didn't do anything with the audio). For the training and validation splits, I also wanted to create sets that were independent with respect to actor. I used some simplistic approaches early on and then a clustering analysis provided in [this kernel](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/hmendonca\/proper-clustering-with-facenet-embeddings-eda).\n\n**tfrecords**\n\nThe first section below details my tfrecod set up, which ended up being really cool. [Tfrecords](https:\/\/www.tensorflow.org\/tutorials\/load_data\/tfrecord) are basically serialized training examples that can be read back into [tf.data.Datasets](https:\/\/www.tensorflow.org\/api_docs\/python\/tf\/data\/Dataset) super efficiently. In order to use TPUs, you create tfrecords and store them on gcs so they can be fed to the TPUs. For my tfrecord set up, I created a single tfrecord for each face detected in each video, storing each face from each frame of the video as a sequence.\n\n**datasets**\n\nThe second section focuses on the datasets that get created from the tfrecords. I really enjoyed the [tf.data.Datasets](https:\/\/www.tensorflow.org\/api_docs\/python\/tf\/data\/Dataset) api. It made it really easy to do thinks like balancing the datasets between fake and real examples, perform augmentation and preprocessing. It also made it possible to use a single set of tfrecords to feed single face cnn, sequence and segmentation models.\n\n**models**\n\nThe third section provides basic versions of the three types of models I used. There is really nothing special in the first two, a single face cnn and an multi-face LSTM. I used the excellent Efficientnet implementatios in the [qubvel\/efficientnet](https:\/\/github.com\/qubvel\/efficientnet) repo for the cnn. I also tried using a pretrained resnet50 model trained on the vggface2 dataset from [WeidiXie\/\nKeras-VGGFace2-ResNet50](https:\/\/github.com\/WeidiXie\/Keras-VGGFace2-ResNet50), unfreezing the weights in the last convolution block, as illustrated in the LSTM example.\n\nThe third model I tried was the one I was most optimistic about, but in the end couldn't make it work. The idea was to create segmentation masks showing the altered pixels in the fake faces by thresholding the difference between the original and fake frames and then train a segmentation model to detect the altered pixels. My thinking was that this was valuable additional information the model could use to develop relationships beyond simple binary classification. I used the excelellent implementation of a Unet with Efficientnet encoder in the [qubvel\/segmentation_models](https:\/\/github.com\/qubvel\/segmentation_models) repo. I added a few additional layers after the segmentation output to calculate the binary classification loss and then weighted the segmentation loss and the binary classification loss. I thought this might actually help get to a better binary classification model by focusing the model's attention on the altered pixels and that it would also be useful to get predictions of which pixels were fake in addition a prediction of binary classification.","a6c8b991":"These records have gone full cycle, from cropped faces from video frames, to serialized tfecords and then parsed back out again.","68d47b97":"# Overview","552a8294":"The tfrecord files are created separately for real and fake videos and for training and validation splits. It was possible to filter tfrecords into training and validation splits after they are parsed, on cluster or zip file number, for example, but that ended up being much slower than doing the splits in writing the files. The real and fake are written separately so that they can be balanced efficiently for training and also because records for the fake videos can be written by looping through fakes for each real video so that frames for each real video only have to be pulled twice, instead of for each fake video (since I create masks from thresholded differences for each face).\n\nThis function just chunks up the original video file names. It includes an argument for number of files, for testing or distributing to other machines.","04555d8f":"## Single Frame CNN ","9743edab":"Creating a good training dataset turned out to be a non-trivial exercise, even for models based on frames without detecting faces. The first challenge was that the meta data didn't identify the actor in the original video, so it wasn't possible to create training and validation splits that were mutually exclusive with respect to actors based on the unique original video name. I ended up using the clustering analysis done in [this kernel](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/hmendonca\/proper-clustering-with-facenet-embeddings-eda), which essentially used a face recognition model to get an embedding for each original video and then performed an analysis to assign each to one of 700 some odd clusters.

I was running batch sizes as large as 2000 in some models.","3e361a68":"This section would get used when running models on individual faces predictions for multiple faces for each video being made.

Lastly, in videos that had more than one face, not all of the faces had modified pixels.\n\nThe faces from the video below illustrate these challenges, where the face from one of the frames has been modified, but the other hasn't. This set of faces also illustrates another, more fundamental challenge that I didn't solve, that of grouping faces of the same person together in sequence. You can see on the first row with faces on the left from box 0 on frame 0 and faces on the right from box 0 on frame 180. In videos with more than one face. Time permitting, I would have run each face through a face identification model, getting an embedding back and then group faces across frames by minimizing the distance from the embedding for the faces from the first frame.","a01304d1":"## Video level classification ","13cc3599":"Load weights from checkpoint.","5600d17d":"### Commit Kernel","836fc919":"Here are some examples of where the model got it right.","1165e64b":"This function actually creates the datasets.
