This is done so that to test our model after having trained it (in this way we can check it\u2019s performances when working with unseen data). When using Cross-Validation, we divide our training set into N other partitions to make sure our model is not overfitting our data.\n\nOne of the most common used Cross-Validation methods is K-Fold Validation. In K-Fold, we divide our training set into N partitions and then iteratively train our model using N-1 partitions and test it with the left-over partition (at each iteration we change the left-over partition). Once having trained N times the model we then average the training results obtained in each iteration to obtain our overall training performance results.\n\nUsing Cross-Validation when implementing Hyperparameters optimization can be really important. In this way, we might avoid using some Hyperparameters which works really good on the training data but not so good with the test data.\nWe can now start implementing Random Search by first defying a grid of hyperparameters which will be randomly sampled when calling RandomizedSearchCV().","015f7d3e":"We can optimize Scikit-Learn hyperparameters, such as the C parameter of SVC and the max_depth of the RandomForestClassifier, in three steps:\n\n* Wrap model training with an objective function and return accuracy\n* Suggest hyperparameters using a trial object\n* Create a study object and execute the optimization","b8086ef6":"We can now evaluate how our model performed using Random Search.

Introduction <a id=\"1\"><\/a> <br>\n\n**Hyperparameter tuning** is choosing a set of optimal hyperparameters for a learning algorithm.\n\n**What is a hyperparameter?\n\n**A hyperparameter is a parameter whose value is set before the learning process begins.**\n\nSome examples of hyperparameters include penalty in logistic regression and loss in stochastic gradient descent.\n\nIn sklearn, hyperparameters are passed in as arguments to the constructor of the model classes.\n\nHyper-parameters are parameters that are not directly learnt within estimators. In scikit-learn they are passed as arguments to the constructor of the estimator classes. Typical examples include C, kernel and gamma for Support Vector Classifier, alpha for Lasso, etc.\n\nIt is possible and recommended to search the hyper-parameter space for the best Cross-validation i.e evaluating estimator performance score.\n\nAny parameter provided when constructing an estimator may be optimized in this manner. Specifically, to find the names and current values for all parameters for a given estimator, we can use the following method\n\nestimator.get_params()\n\nA search consists of:\n\n* an estimator (regressor or classifier such as sklearn.svm.SVC());\n* a parameter space;\n* a method for searching or sampling candidates;\n* a cross-validation scheme;\n* a score function.\n\nSome models allow for specialized, efficient parameter search strategies, outlined below.\n\nTwo generic approaches to sampling search candidates are provided in scikit-learn:\n![](https:\/\/developer.qualcomm.com\/sites\/default\/files\/attachments\/learning_resources_03-05.png)\n**GridSearchCV** :For given values, GridSearchCV exhaustively considers all parameter combinations. The grid search provided by GridSearchCV exhaustively generates candidates from a grid of parameter values specified with the param_grid parameter.\nFor instance, the following param_grid specifies that it has one grid to be explored that is a linear kernel with alpha values in [0.0002,0.0003,0.0004,0.0005,0.0006,0.0007,0.0009], and 'max_iter' i.e maximum 10000 iterations.\n\nparam_grid = {'alpha':[0.01,0.001,0.0001,0.0002,0.0003,0.0004,0.0005,0.0006,0.0007,0.0009],'max_iter':[10000]}\n\n**RandomizedSearchCV**: It can sample a given number of candidates from a parameter space with a specified distribution.\nAfter describing these tools we detail best practice applicable to both approaches.\n\nNote that it is common that a small subset of those parameters can have a large impact on the predictive or computation performance of the model while others can be left to their default values. It is recommend to read the docstring of the estimator class to get a finer understanding of their expected behavior.\n\nI think it is enough of the theory .Now lets jump into practice.\n\nTo perform Hyperparameters Optimization in Python, we will use Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset. ","625633f2":"Grid Search is slower compared to Random Search but it can be overall more effective because it can go through the whole search space. Instead, Random Search can be faster fast but might miss some important points in the search space.\n# 5.

Manual tuning takes time away from important steps of the machine learning pipeline like feature engineering and interpreting results. Grid and random search are hands-off, but require long run times because they waste time evaluating unpromising areas of the search space. Increasingly, hyperparameter tuning is done by automated methods that aim to find optimal hyperparameters in less time using an informed search with no manual effort necessary beyond the initial set-up.\n\nWhen using Automated Hyperparameter Tuning, the model hyperparameters to use are identified using techniques such as: Bayesian Optimization, Gradient Descent and Evolutionary Algorithms.\n\n## Bayesian Optimization using HyperOpt <a id=\"51\"><\/a> <br>\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/BWbgCSx.jpg)\nBayesian optimization, a model-based method for finding the minimum of a function,while the final aim is to find the input value to a function which can give us the lowest possible output value has resulted in achieving better performance while requiring fewer iterations than random search.  Bayesian Optimization can, therefore, lead to better performance in the testing phase and reduced optimization time.\n\nBayesian Optimization can be performed in Python using the Hyperopt library.  \n\n![](https:\/\/camo.githubusercontent.com\/b92ead141ef3726da38eef053864aa1173012789\/68747470733a2f2f692e706f7374696d672e63632f54506d66665772702f68797065726f70742d6e65772e706e67)\n\nIn Hyperopt, Bayesian Optimization can be implemented giving 3 three main parameters to the function fmin().\n\n* **Objective Function** = defines the loss function to minimize.\n* **Domain Space** = defines the range of input values to test (in Bayesian Optimization this space creates a probability distribution for each of the used Hyperparameters).\n* **Optimization Algorithm** = defines the search algorithm to use to select the best input values to use in each new iteration.\n\nAdditionally, can also be defined in **fmin()** the maximum number of evaluations to perform.\n\nBayesian Optimization can reduce the number of search iterations by choosing the input values bearing in mind the past outcomes. In this way, we can concentrate our search from the beginning on values which are closer to our desired output.\nWe can now run our Bayesian Optimizer using the fmin() function. A Trials() object is first created to make possible to visualize later what was going on while the **fmin()** function was running (eg. how the loss function was changing and how to used Hyperparameters were changing).\n\n\nHyperopt is one of several automated hyperparameter tuning libraries using Bayesian optimization. These libraries differ in the algorithm used to both construct the surrogate (probability model) of the objective function and choose the next hyperparameters to evaluate in the objective function. Hyperopt uses the Tree Parzen Estimator (TPE). Other Python libraries include Spearmint, which uses a Gaussian process for the surrogate, and SMAC, which uses a random forest regression.\n\nHyperopt has a simple syntax for structuring an optimization problem which extends beyond hyperparameter tuning to any problem that involves minimizing a function.","2bed45a0":"![](https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/dA_x2xHTYQE\/maxresdefault.jpg)\n\n<font size='5' color='blue' align = 'center'>Table of Contents<\/font> \n<font size='3' color='purple'>\n1.

Simply provide a Python script that takes a set of hyperparameters as arguments and performs a single trial evaluation. A database collects the partial results in real-time, and the hyperparameter optimization algorithm decides what to do next.\n\nSHERPA is a Python library for hyperparameter tuning of machine learning models.
