Let\u2019s look at the main pandas data structures for working with time series data.\n\n## Manipulating datetime\nPython's basic objects for working with dates and times reside in the built-in `datetime` module. In pandas, a single point in time is represented as a `Timestamp` and we can use `datetime()` function to create Timestamps from strings in a wide variety of date\/time formats.","499097b5":"We can also calculate the latest date location and the earliest date index location as follows:","05ae93ba":"## Shifting based off time string code\nWe can also use the offset from the offset table for time shifting.

In this article, we saw how pandas can be used for wrangling and visualizing time series data. \n\nWe also performed tasks like time sampling, time shifting and rolling with stock data. These are usually the first steps in analyzing any time series data. Going forward, we could use this data to perform a basic financial analysis by calculating the daily percentage change in stocks to get an idea about the volatility of stock prices. Another way we could use this data would be to predict Maruti\u2019s stock prices for the next few days by employing machine learning techniques. This would be especially helpful from the shareholder\u2019s point of view. ","527849f9":"# Time series data\n\nTime series data is a sequence of data points in chronological order that is used by businesses to analyze past data and make future predictions. These data points are a set of observations at specified times and equal intervals, typically with a datetime index and corresponding value. Common examples of time series data in our day-to-day lives include:      \n\n* Measuring weather temperatures \n* Measuring the number of taxi rides per month\n* Predicting a company\u2019s stock prices for the next day\n\n## Components of Time\u00a0Series\n\nTime series data consist of four components:\n\n* Trend Component: This is a variation that moves up or down in a reasonably predictable pattern over a long period.\n\n* Seasonality Component: is the variation that is regular and periodic and repeats itself over a specific period such as a day, week, month, season, etc.,\n\n* Cyclical Component: is the variation that corresponds with business or economic 'boom-bust' cycles or follows their own peculiar cycles, and\n\n* Random Component: is the variation that is erratic or residual and does not fall under any of the above three classifications.\n\nTo make this concept more clear here is a visual interpretation of the various components of the Time Series.
