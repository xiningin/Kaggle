As the \u201cneural\u201d part of their name suggests, they are brain-inspired systems which are intended to replicate the way that we humans learn. Neural networks consist of input and output layers, as well as (in most cases) a hidden layer consisting of units that transform the input into something that the output layer can use. They are excellent tools for finding patterns which are far too complex or numerous for a human programmer to extract and teach the machine to recognize.\n\nWhile neural networks (also called \u201cperceptrons\u201d) have been around since the 1940s, it is only in the last several decades where they have become a major part of artificial intelligence. This is due to the arrival of a technique called \u201cbackpropagation,\u201d which allows networks to adjust their hidden layers of neurons in situations where the outcome doesn\u2019t match what the creator is hoping for \u2014 like a network designed to recognize dogs, which misidentifies a cat, for example.\n\nAnother important advance has been the arrival of deep learning neural networks, in which different layers of a multilayer network extract different features until it can recognize what it is looking for.","360163f2":"We are going to convert rain column to numeric for ann","d5b5d0a2":"# Rain Forecasting with Artificial Neural Network\n\nWe'll try to predict rain with ANN.\nLet's start !","d81f3d24":"We 'll make normalization to X values.","7cda66a8":"# It's Great !","a8a015fc":"![](http:\/\/icdn5.digitaltrends.com\/image\/artificial_neural_network_1-791x388.jpg)","41cc68af":"We are going to create ann model.","42b4bc5d":"# EDA"}}
