Some employees leave the company as they reach their retirement age while some leave due to many factors but not limited to lower satisfaction rate, lower pay rate, and toxic work environment. Measuring attrition can uncover many answers related to the functioning within the organisation. Higher attrition rates signal a need for further investigation.\n\nThe dataset used to examine the trends related to Employee Attrition is a fictional data set created by IBM data scientists. Using Python and its frameworks, we would try to uncover factors that might be related to the attrition levels among the employees.\n\n\n","487edbc5":"# Lets perform some hacker statistics to infer the attrition rate of the IBM population.\n\n\nThis is purely for fun.
