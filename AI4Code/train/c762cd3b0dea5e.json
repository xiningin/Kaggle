They also provide access to the Changi Ariport. LRT stations are concentrated in 2 different areas where MRT lines are less prevelant. It can be assumed that those 2 areas are too highly poplulated for sparce MRT in the region, therefore LRT serves as a feeder line for the MRT","ed1e2ba5":"# Drawing heatmap\n\nThe map object centered on Singapore coordinates was created. Then I got dataframes of coordinates for each station type. These dataframes were later used to create heamaps for each station type, with different colors for each type (red for MRT, blue for LRT). Heatmaps were then added to previously created map of Singapore"}}
