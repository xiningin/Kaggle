This is because the algorithm found the two variables that separate between classes the most. Finally, let's see how Kernel PCA works\n\n# 3. Kernel PCA\nIn fact, previous models are linear models. For non-linear problems, Kernel PCA works very well. Kernel PCA is not much different from PCA because we are only using an extra kernel trick to map the dataset to a higher dimension, and then make the dataset linearly separable. Let's use a dataset that has non-linear patterns: Social Network Ads dataset.\n\n### Dataset Overview","d309bd53":"Now, we only have two independent variables! Let's simply apply Logistic Regression model as we prepared our dataset using PCA.

","8f2690a4":"As we had 13 independent variables, the algorithm ranked these variables from the first principal component that explains the most variance to the one with the least variance. Therefore, if we include one component, we will take 37 % of  the variance. If two, 37 % + 19 % = 56 %. In this case, taking two components would be sufficient.\n\nNow that the number of n_components is set, we can redo the PCA process.","80612b83":" The algorithm produced very good results! \n \n -------------\n Thank you for reading this kernel.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA)\n### 2. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)\n### 3. Kernel PCA\n--------\nThese are are all part of Feature Extraction. Dimensionality regression is used to reduce the number of independent variables. Two variables will be left that most explains the variance.\n\n### Note:\nPCA and LDA are used for **linear** problems, and Kernel PCA is used for **non-linear** problems.\n\n\n# 1.

Extracted features (independent variables) are called principal components.","8eda9e95":"As numbers on the diagonal line shows the correct predictions, we can say the model is really good.

Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)\nFrom the n independent variables of the dataset, LDA extracts p \u2264 n new independent variables that separate the most the classes of the dependent variable. While PCA is unsupervised learning, LDA is supervised as it chooses variables in relation to the dependent variable.","de4894c5":"In this dataset, the company is trying to see whether or not a customer will buy a product according to gender, age and estimated salary.
