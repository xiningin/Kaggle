This is my first notebook and it is primarily for me learning analytics. The following comments etc. may seem too much, but it is keeping in mind that I may use this notebook for future reference.\nThanks for going through this!\n\n## What Is the Efficient Frontier?\n\nThe efficient frontier is the set of optimal portfolios that offer the highest expected return for a defined level of risk or the lowest risk for a given level of expected return. Portfolios that lie below the efficient frontier are sub-optimal because they do not provide enough return for the level of risk. Portfolios that cluster to the right of the efficient frontier are sub-optimal because they have a higher level of risk for the defined rate of return.\n\nI'm utilizing the data from NSE NIFTY50 stocks, to prepare a Markowitz Efficient Frontier.\n","82dd4f99":"And now the last bit of code to help us get get our x values for the efficient frontier.

It will return the volatility (index 1) of the given weights.","d5f84fe2":"Finally we can plot the actual efficient frontier by passing the variables frontier_x and frontier_y.","0f8d9c22":"We want the key x from the dictionary, which is an array with the weights of the portfolio that has the maximum Sharpe ratio.
