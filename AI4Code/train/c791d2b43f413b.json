A few potential explanations for this:\n1. They haven't built new houses where this data was collected.\n1. The data was collected a long time ago. Houses built after the data publication wouldn't show up.\n\nIf the reason is explanation #1 above, does that affect your trust in the model you build with this data? What about if it is reason #2?\n\nHow could you dig into the data to see which explanation is more plausible?\n\nCheck out this **[discussion thread](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/learn-forum\/60581)** to see what others think or to add your ideas.\n\n# Keep Going\n\nYou are ready for **[Your First Machine Learning Model](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/dansbecker\/your-first-machine-learning-model).**\n","a6ce335a":"## Step 1: Loading Data\nRead the Iowa data file into a Pandas DataFrame called `home_data`.","ee1adf27":"This exercise will test your ability to read a data file and understand statistics about the data.\n\nIn later exercises, you will apply techniques to filter the data, build a machine learning model, and iteratively improve your model.\n\nThe course examples use data from Melbourne. To ensure you can apply these techniques on your own, you will have to apply them to a new dataset (with house prices from Iowa).\n\nThe exercises use a \"notebook\" coding environment.
