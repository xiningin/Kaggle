Managed with restraint, they are intended to be self-willed lands, both philosophically and practically. Due to their unique character, these truly wild spaces have become part of a cavalier American identify. Found in most states, but concentrated in the west, they protect lush forests, arid deserts, snow-capped peaks, dank swamps and sandy beaches.

A wide range of topographical, soil and growing conditions further influence this variety and contribute to the state\u2019s multi-faceted forest resources.\n\n### Forest Types Overview\n\nForest type, or forest cover, refers to the dominant tree species in the overstory of a given site. The distribution of forest types across the landscape is determined by factors such as climate, soil, elevation, aspect and disturbance history (Rogers, et al, 2001). A number of Colorado\u2019s forests are characterized as disturbance driven. The life history of these forest types evolved with a cycle of natural disturbance such as wildfire, insect infestations, flooding, avalanches, windstorms or disease infections. These disturbances served to periodically rejuvenate forests, ensuring a variety of forest types, age classes and densities across the landscape. Due to lack of disturbance, the majority of Colorado\u2019s forests are concentrated in older age classes, with virtually no significant forest in the zero to 20-year age classes.\n\n### Colorado Forest Types   \n\nColorado\u2019s major tree species include bristlecone pine, Colorado blue spruce, Douglas-fir, Engelmann spruce, limber pine, lodgepole pine, narrowleaf cottonwood, quaking aspen, pi\u00f1on pine, plains cottonwood, ponderosa pine, Rocky Mountain juniper, subalpine fir and white fir,and the cottonwood-willow combination found in many riparian areas.  \n\n\n### About Target Predict   \n\nThe study area includes four wilderness areas located in the Roosevelt National Forest of northern Colorado.         \nEach observation is a 30m x 30m patch. You are asked to predict an integer classification for the forest cover type. \n\n***The seven types are:***   \n\n<big>1.Spruce\/Fir (Picea pungens):<\/big>\n\n<left><img src=\"https:\/\/csfs.colostate.edu\/media\/sites\/22\/2016\/04\/blue-spruce-tree.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;width:auto;height:auto;\"><\/left>\n\n**Bark:** Gray-brown with thick scales on mature trees.      \n**Leaves:** Evergreen needles are blue or light green with white lines; 1 to 1-1\/4 inches long. stiff and the points extremely sharp, light green with a white stripe.      \n**Fruit:** Shiny light brown, cylindrical cones; 2 to 4 inches long with thin, long, flexible and irregularly toothed scales; contains paired, long-winged seeds.      \n    \n<left><img src=\"https:\/\/csfs.colostate.edu\/media\/sites\/22\/2016\/06\/blue-spruce-leaftall-225x300.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;width:auto;height:auto;\"><\/left>\n\n**Elevation:** 6,000 to 11,000 feet.   \n**Height:** 20 to 80 feet.   \n**Habitat:** Mostly well-drained soils in high elevations, often in pure stands.   \n**Relation to Fire:** Ground fires kill many trees due to thin bark. New stands quickly establish when cones open and seeds are released.\n\n<big>2.Lodgepole Pine (Pinus contorta):<\/big>\n\n<left><img src=\"https:\/\/csfs.colostate.edu\/media\/sites\/22\/2014\/02\/lodgepole-tree2.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;width:auto;height:auto;\"><\/left>    \n\n**Bark:** Light brown, thin with many small scales.   \n**Leaves:** Evergreen needles are yellow to dark green; 1 to 3 inches long;sharply pointed, stiff, stout, slightly flattened and often twisted; 2 needles per bundle.      \n**Fruit:** Shiny, yellow-brown, egg-shaped, serotinous* cones; to 2 inches long with raised, rounded cone scales and a tiny point.      \n * Seeds released from cones by exposure to extreme heat.\n \n<left><img src=\"https:\/\/csfs.colostate.edu\/media\/sites\/22\/2016\/06\/Lodgepole-Leaftall-225x300.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;width:auto;height:auto;\"><\/left>\n\n**Elevation:** 6,000 to 11,000 feet.   \n**Height:** 20 to 80 feet.   \n**Habitat:** Mostly well-drained soils in high elevations, often in pure stands.   \n**Relation to Fire:** Ground fires kill many trees due to thin bark. New stands quickly establish when cones open and seeds are released. \n\n<big>3.Ponderosa Pine (Pinus ponderosa):<\/big>   \n\n<left><img src=\"https:\/\/csfs.colostate.edu\/media\/sites\/22\/2014\/02\/ponderosa-tree-modern.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;width:auto;height:auto;\"><\/left>     \n\n**Bark:** Dark on young trees; nearly 3 inches thick, red-orange and furrowed into large, flat scaly plates on mature trees.   \n**Leaves:** Evergreen needles are stiff, dark yellow-green; 3 to 7 inches long; typically in bundles of 3 that form tufts near the ends of branches.   \n**Fruit:** Light red-brown cones; 3 to 4 inches long; egg-shaped with scales that are tipped by a sharp point; small, long-winged seeds.   \n\n<left><img src=\"https:\/\/csfs.colostate.edu\/media\/sites\/22\/2016\/06\/Ponderosa-Leaftall-225x300.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;width:auto;height:auto;\"><\/left>   \n\n**Elevation:** 6,300 to 9,500 feet.   \n**Height:** 40 to 160 feet.   \n**Habitat:** Dry, nutrient poor soils in open park-like stands or with Douglas-fir, Rocky Mountain juniper and spruce.   \n**Relation to Fire:** Resistant to fire, due to open crowns, thick, insulating bark, self-pruning branches, high moisture content in the leaves and thick bud scales.   \n\n<big>4.Cottonwood\/Willow (Populus deltoides):<\/big>   \n\n<left><img src=\"https:\/\/csfs.colostate.edu\/media\/sites\/22\/2016\/04\/Plains-Cotton-tree.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;width:auto;height:auto;\"><\/left>       \n    \n**Bark:** Green-yellow and smooth while young; dark gray, thick, rough and deeply furrowed at maturity.      \n**Leaves:** Broad-leafed foliage is glossy and yellow-green; 3 to 6 inches long, 4 to 6 inches wide; toothed margins.      \n**Fruit:** Inch long with capsules containing 3 to 4 valves; many tiny, cotton-like seeds inside valves.      \n\n<left><img src=\"https:\/\/csfs.colostate.edu\/media\/sites\/22\/2016\/04\/Plains-Cotton-leaf-225x300.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;width:auto;height:auto;\"><\/left>     \n\n**Elevation:** 3,500 to 6,500 feet.     \n**Height:** 36 to 190 feet.      \n**Habitat:** Found in floodplains, bordering streams, near springs and in moist woodlands; pure stands or with willows.        \n**Relation to Fire:** Generally killed by fire; very poor sprouting response.        \n\n<big>5.Aspen (Populus tremuloides):<\/big>   \n\n<left><img src=\"https:\/\/csfs.colostate.edu\/media\/sites\/22\/2016\/04\/Aspen-trees-path.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;width:auto;height:auto;\"><\/left>       \n\n**Bark:** Green-white, smooth and thin with raised dark patches; on very large trees, trunk base is often gray, thick and furrowed.   \n**Leaves:** Broad-leaf foliage is bright green above and dull green below; rounded with a pointed tip, \n1 to 3 inches wide on a flattened leaf head; nearly round and sawtoothed.   \n**Fruit:** Fruit are catkins; up to 4 inches long; many light green capsules contain 6 to 8 tiny, cotton-like seeds.   \n\n<left><img src=\"https:\/\/csfs.colostate.edu\/media\/sites\/22\/2016\/06\/Aspen-leavestall-225x300.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;width:auto;height:auto;\"><\/left>     \n\n**Elevation:** 6,500 to 11,500 feet.   \n**Height:** 35 to 50 feet.   \n**Habitat:** Many soil types, especially on well-drained, sandy and gravelly slopes; often in pure stands.   \n**Relation to Fire:** Easily killed by fire, but quick to send out many sucker shoots; readily colonizes after a fire.   \n\n<big>6.Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii):<\/big>      \n\n<left><img src=\"https:\/\/csfs.colostate.edu\/media\/sites\/22\/2014\/02\/Douglas-fir-treerevised.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;width:auto;height:auto;\"><\/left>      \n  \n**Bark:** Gray and smooth with resin blisters on young trees; red-brown, very thick and deeply furrowed with broad, often corky ridges at maturity.   \n**Leaves:** Evergreen needles are to 1-inch long with bracts at the base.   \n**Fruit:** Light brown, short-stalked cones that hang down from the branches; 1-1\/3 to 3 inches long; many thin, rounded cone scales on top of long, 3-pointed, winged seeds that stick out beyond scales.    \n\n<left><img src=\"https:\/\/csfs.colostate.edu\/media\/sites\/22\/2016\/04\/Doug-Fir-cone-226x300.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;width:auto;height:auto;\"><\/left>    \n\n**Elevation:** 6,000 to 9,500 feet.   \n**Height:** 100 to 130 feet.    \n**Habitat:** Rocky soils of moist northern slopes; in pure stands and mixed conifer forests.   \n**Relation to Fire:** Thin, resinous bark of young trees makes them highly susceptible to fire; after 40 years, trees have developed a very thick layer of bark to protect them during hot ground and surface fires.   \n\n\n<big>7.Krummholz:<\/big>      \n\n   \nKrummholz or krumholtz (German: krumm, \"crooked, bent, twisted\" and Holz, \"wood\") \u2014 also called knieholz (\"knee timber\") \u2014 is a type of stunted, deformed vegetation encountered in the subarctic and subalpine tree line landscapes, shaped by continual exposure to fierce, freezing winds. Under these conditions, trees can only survive where they are sheltered by rock formations or snow cover. As the lower portion of these trees continues to grow, the coverage becomes extremely dense near the ground. In Newfoundland and Labrador, the formation is known as tuckamore.Krummholz trees are also found on beaches such as the Oregon coast, where trees can become much taller than their subalpine cousins.   \n\n<left><img src=\"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/7\/76\/Windswept_trees_in_Colorado.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;width:auto;height:auto;\"><\/left>","0c07db21":"### stamentoner","054c7619":"# Pandas Report","f0b9214b":"### Rawah wilderness \n\nThe United States Congress designated the Rawah Wilderness (map of the Rawah Wilderness) in 1964 and it now has a total of See Rawah Wilderness breakdown  of 74,408 acres.
