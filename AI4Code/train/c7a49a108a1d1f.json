These are the 25th and 75th percentile of our data and so the distance between them gives us that middle 50 percent for how spread out the middle 50 percent of our data is. So basically the length of the box is our interquartile range. The final two numbers are the minimum and maximum value of the data. The median location would be marked in the middle location, and the min and max would be drawn by taking a line. These lines are sometimes called whiskers.\n\n","92f2d331":"### Main Aspect\n Histogram has 4 main aspect which can help to summaries a quantitative data. \n*      **Shape:** Overall appearance of histogram.

It can be descriptive or inferential. Uni means \u201cone\u201d. So in this type analysis data contains only one variable. Univariate data analysis don\u2019t need to find relation between variable. It purpose is to summaries that one variables' data and find out the pattern that exist in that data.\n\n**Example:** Suppose you have children **weight** data reading in a school. Now you want to add another variable, **Age** to that data. In Univariate Descriptive analysis it will not find any relation if weight is related to age or not. It will simply summaries the weight data to find the pattern. \n\nWay to describe Univariate data include Central Tendency: mean, mode and median, and dispersion: range, variance, maximum, quartiles and standard deviation.\n","c88213b5":"\nThis plot definitely not symmetric, in fact it is skewed to the right.
