From four different areas of expertise, namely GW physics, Geophysics, Computing Science and Robotics, these scientists have agreed on a common goal of tackling challenges in data analysis and noise characterization for GW detectors.\n\n`In this competition, we aim to detect GW signals from the mergers of binary black holes.` \n\nSpecifically, we will build a model to analyze simulated GW time-series data from a network of Earth-based detectors.\n\nThe series of images below are taken from the 2015 [paper](https:\/\/journals.aps.org\/prl\/abstract\/10.1103\/PhysRevLett.116.061102) paper announcing the discovery of gravitational waves from a pair of merging black holes.\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/kaggle-media\/competitions\/G2Net-gravitational-waves\/800px-LIGO_measurement_of_gravitational_waves.svg.png\"\/>\n\n****What are we predicting?****\n\nWe need to predict the probability whether the given observation contains a gravitational wave","0a68c803":"**Points to Note:**\n1.

Virgo\n\n\nEach time series contains either detector noise or detector noise plus a simulated gravitational wave signal. \n\n`The task is to identify when a signal is present in the data (target=1).`\n\nEach data sample (npy file) contains 3 time series (1 for each detector) and each spans 2 sec and is sampled at 2,048 Hz.\n\n##### Files\n`train folder` - the training set files, one npy file per observation; labels are provided in a files shown below\n\n`test folder` - the test set files; you must predict the probability that the observation contains a gravitational wave\n\n`training_labels.csv` - target values of whether the associated signal contains a gravitational wave\n\n`sample_submission.csv` - a sample submission file in the correct format","39784f1f":"# WORK IN PROGRESS - MODEL COMING UP SOON","c2b4defe":"<a id=\"section-six\"><\/a>\n# Data Analysis (Let's pick up a random file and analyze it)","84987584":"<a id=\"section-three\"><\/a>\n# Import Libraries","bea37914":"****Both the labels (target=0,target=1) have equal distribution in the dataset****","ffacbc4e":"**Note**\n1.
