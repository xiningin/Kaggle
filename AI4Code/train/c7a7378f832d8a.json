Only after importing the data can the data scientist clean, wrangle, visualize, and build predictive models on it.\n\nIn this guide, you'll learn the techniques to import data into Python. \n\n### Import CSV files\nIt is important to note that a singlebackslash does not work when specifying the file path. You need to either change it to forward slash or add one more backslash like below\n* import pandas as pd\n* mydata= pd.read_csv(\"C:\\\\Users\\\\Deepanshu\\\\Documents\\\\file1.csv\")\n\n### Import File from URL\nYou don't need to perform additional steps to fetch data from URL. Simply put URL in read_csv() function (applicable only for CSV files stored in URL).\n* mydata = pd.read_csv(\"http:\/\/winterolympicsmedals.com\/medals.csv\")\n\n\n### Read Text File\nWe can use read_table() function to pull data from text file. We can also use read_csv() with sep= \"\\t\" to read data from tab-separated file.\n* mydata = pd.read_table(\"C:\\\\Users\\\\jasprit\\\\Desktop\\\\example2.txt\")\n* mydata = pd.read_csv(\"C:\\\\Users\\\\jasprit\\\\Desktop\\\\example2.txt\", sep =\"\\t\")\n\n### Read Excel File\nThe read_excel() function can be used to import excel data into Python.\n* mydata = pd.read_excel(\" https:\/\/www.eia.gov\/dnav\/pet\/hist_xls\/RBRTEd.xls \", sheetname=\"Data 1\", skiprows=2)\n\nIf you do not specify name of sheet in sheetname= option, it would take by default first sheet."}}
