Larger particles would be filtered in the nasal duct.\n\n**What is SPM?**\n\nSuspended Particulate Matter (SPM) are microscopic solid or liquid matter suspended in Earth's atmosphere. The term aerosol commonly refers to the particulate\/air mixture, as opposed to the particulate matter alone.[3] Sources of particulate matter can be natural or anthropogenic. They have impacts on climate and precipitation that adversely affect human health.","7706d68c":"### **Checking missing values in data**","76d2a983":"### ** High RSPM and SPM statewise **\n- Uttar Pradesh,Maharastra and Punjab states have High RSPM\n- Mahrastra,Uttr Pradesh and Rajasthan states have High SPM","bfb719f0":"# Fill the Missing Value","b0476188":"### ** Per state year wise No2 Emission we just display 2008-2015**","faef6436":"### ** High RSPM and SPM citywise **\n- Delhi,Kanpur and Ludhiana city have High RSPM\n- Delhi,Kanpur and Agra city have High SPM","3c14a8d7":"### ** Stay Connected For More Update!!!**","cf7adc36":"### **Split date column to year,month and day**","ab080db5":"### ** Area type wise So2 and No2 Anlaysis**\n\n- RIRUO have more So2 Emission\n- Industrial Areas have more No2 Emission","d5c5cff8":"### ** Per state year wise So2 Emission we just display 2008-2015**","6d9de36a":"** Fill missing values of column type float\/int using mean of respective column**","731c84f5":"### **Fill zero values in field year,month and day**","58590472":"### **Indian Statewise average analysis of No2,So2,RSPM,SPM**","d28cf160":"### ** High So2 and No2 citywise **\n- Byrnihat,Gajroula and Jamshedpur city have High So2 Emission\n- Howrah,Badlapur and Dombivli city have High No2 Emission","3af24091":"** Object Type column filled with other**","d57c600c":"### ** After preprocessing data we use Tableau for Visualization **","0f742823":"**What is sulfur dioxide(So2)?**\n\nSulfur dioxide is a gas. It is invisible and has a nasty, sharp smell. It reacts easily with other substances to form harmful compounds, such as sulfuric acid, sulfurous acid and sulfate particles.\n\nAbout 99% of the sulfur dioxide in air comes from human sources. The main source of sulfur dioxide in the air is industrial activity that processes materials that contain sulfur, eg the generation of electricity from coal, oil or gas that contains sulfur. Some mineral ores also contain sulfur, and sulfur dioxide is released when they are processed. In addition, industrial activities that burn fossil fuels containing sulfur can be important sources of sulfur dioxide.\n\nSulfur dioxide is also present in motor vehicle emissions, as the result of fuel combustion. In the past, motor vehicle exhaust was an important, but not the main, source of sulfur dioxide in air. However, this is no longer the case.\n\n**What is nitrogen dioxide(No2)?**\n\nNitrogen dioxide (NO2) is one of the nitrogen oxides (NOx), a group of air pollutants produced from combustion processes.\n\nIn urban outdoor air, the presence of NO2 is mainly due to traffic. Nitric oxide (NO), which is emitted by motor vehicles or other combustion processes, combines with oxygen in the atmosphere, producing NO2. Indoor NO2 is produced mainly by unvented heaters and gas stoves.","e9e2f885":"### **Indian states citywise average analysis of No2,So2,RSPM,SPM**"}}
