But however, it is mainly used for classification problems. As we know that a forest is made up of trees and more trees means more robust forest.

It is an ensemble method which is better than a single decision tree because it reduces the over-fitting by averaging the result.\n> > > The random forest is a classification algorithm consisting of many decisions trees.
