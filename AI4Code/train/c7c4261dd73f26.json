drastic increase in energy consumption from 2018 to 2019, I decide to add 2020's monthly data into the equation to see how has the Circuit Breaker influenced the energy consumption. To do this, I filtered the relevant years with a function. Also, I tried a different way of preparing the data. Instead of creating separate variables with filtered data like the above example, I stored 'year\/month' and its respective data into two empty lists.","f8fa66db":"**Understanding and Cleaning our Dataset**\n\nHaving viewed the first fifteen rows of the dataset, it shows that the 'month' column is not arranged by year, making it difficult to follow along. At first, I was unsure how the values for the 'overall' column are derived, but after some calculations, I figured out that it is the addition of the 'public_housing', 'private_housing' and 'others' columns. The 'public_housing' column is the sum of '1-room_2-room', '3-room', '4-room' and '5-room and executive', while the 'private_housing' column is the sum of 'private_apts_and_condo' and 'landed_properties'. In the following lines of code, I decide to convert the strings to floats and rename the column headers for clarity. Then, I created copies of the dataset as I intend to plot several graphs for visualisation.","57bea2d2":"<a id=\"6\"><\/a>\n# Conclusion\n\nThe implementation of the Circuit Breaker has saw positive results, but it comes with some costs. One such consequence is the increase in household energy consumption, with the highest increase from private apartments and condos. However, the Government of Singapore has rolled GST Vouchers to partially offset utility bills, among a slew of other incentives. Below is the overview of the electricity consumption from 2015 to 2020. A key observation is that with only seven months of data recorded for 2020, the numbers have shown to be higher than the previous years. ","bda4ee59":"**Plotting of Graph: Monthly Electricity Consumption Across Various Dwelling Types**","cbba5e45":"**Reading CSV Files**\n\nThe dataset that I used is from Energy Consumption Singapore. This is released publicily at its website and can also be found at data.gov.sg. This dataset shows the monthly electricity consumption from 2005 to the first seven months of 2020. The data for the remaining months of data is not updated as of the time I worked on this project (Dec 2020).","31c012e1":"<a id=\"3\"><\/a>\n# Total Annual Electricity Consumption (2015 to 2019)\n\nFor my first graph, I decided to show the total annual electricity consumption from 2015 to 2019. I did not use 2020's data as only the first six months were present in the dataset. As I wanted to show the annual electricity consumption, I felt that incomplete data should not be used together with the other years. To begin, I renamed the heading from 'year\/month' to 'year' and calculated its sum, before plotting the line graph.","ad551029":"**Plotting of Graph: Monthly Household Electricity Consumption**","71c7ffca":"**Understanding the Graph**\n\nI now have the spread across a substantial number of months. I can infer that the 'landed apartments' has the highest spike in consumption for its gradient is steeper than the rest. However, it is more convicing if actual values are used to infer that this dwelling type has the greatest impact. As such, I continued on with my analysis.","070fd5a5":"**Renaming Year\/Month to Year and Selecting Relevant Rows**","fac183a4":"**Determining the Actual Increase in Consumption From May 2020 to Jun 2020**","150b82df":"**Contents**\n* [Introduction](#1)\n* [Importing of Modules and Packages](#2)\n* [Total Annual Electricity Consumption (2015 to 2019)](#3)\n* [Monthly Electricity Consumption (Jan 2019 to Jul 2020)](#4)\n* [Monthly Electricity Consumption by Dwelling Type (Jan 2019 to Jul 2020)](#5)\n* [Conclusion](#6)","b4ea7719":"Preview","751376de":"<a id=\"2\"><\/a>\n**Importing of Modules and Packages**","6b04c28f":"**Understanding the Graph**\n\nYes, Circuit Breaker caused the energy consumption to rise much higher than 2019's monthly records.

Even though I can use the same variables (housing_df_month), I decided to use a fresh dataset which I copied earlier in case I have plans for further analysis.

Otherwise known as the Circuit Breaker, schools shifted to home-based learning, non-essential services ceased operations while workers are encouraged to work-from-home. It resulted in a decrease in number of unlinked cases. However, as everyone was now at home, it means that household energy consumption such as electricity, water and gas is bound to increase. As such, I conducted an analysis to determine how has electricity consumption changed over the years.
