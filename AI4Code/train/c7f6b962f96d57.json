Multi-class Classification problems\n\n> Multi-Class classification are those predictive modeling problems where examples are assigned one of more than two classes\n\n**3.1 Multi-Class Cross Entropy**\n> Cross Entropy is the default loss function for multi-class classification. It's also known as Categorical Crossentropy\n\n\nPS: I don't know the formula for categorical cross entropy. Let me know in the comments below!\nAlso these are the only loss functions which I have used. I'll add more loss functions as I come across them!\n","a134a5a1":"# 2.
