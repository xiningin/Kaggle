This is a common way for approaching the strong imbalance with respect to the pixel labels. The image segmentation model is trained dropping all the images without ships by one author and dropping most of those images by the other. Also, in both cases, the ship detection task is addressed with transfer learning while the image segmentation task is addressed with a `U-net` model.  Currently, iafoss' is working on an `SSD`, a more complex but also more promising model, at least from his point of view.\n\n\n### References\n#### Kernels\n*  [Fine-tuning ResNet34 on ship detection](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/iafoss\/fine-tuning-resnet34-on-ship-detection\/notebook)\n* [U-net34 (dice 0.87+)](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/iafoss\/unet34-dice-0-87\/notebook) \n* [U-net34 submission (0.89 public LB)](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/iafoss\/unet34-submission-0-89-public-lb)\n* [Baseline U-net model - Part 1](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/kmader\/baseline-u-net-model-part-1\/notebook)    and [Part 2](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/kmader\/from-trained-u-net-to-submission-part-2) \n* [Transfer Learning for Boat or No-Boat](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/kmader\/transfer-learning-for-boat-or-no-boat)\n* [Classification and Segmentation (-FP)](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/hmendonca\/classification-and-segmentation-fp) \n* [One line Base Model LB:0.847](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/paulorzp\/one-line-base-model-lb-0-847) \n* [Naive Model](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/npatta01\/naive-model)\n\n\n#### Other resources\n* [Deeplearning.net's U-net explanation](http:\/\/deeplearning.net\/tutorial\/unet.html)\n* [Deeplearning.net's FCN for 2D segmentation explanation](http:\/\/deeplearning.net\/tutorial\/fcn_2D_segm.html)\n* [A 2017 Guide to Semantic Segmentation with Deep Learning](http:\/\/blog.qure.ai\/notes\/semantic-segmentation-deep-learning-review#dilation)\n* [How to do Semantic Segmentation using Deep learning](https:\/\/medium.com\/nanonets\/how-to-do-image-segmentation-using-deep-learning-c673cc5862ef)\n* [Deep Learning book](https:\/\/leonardoaraujosantos.gitbooks.io\/artificial-inteligence\/content\/image_segmentation.html)\n\n### What's next?\nYou can check the [next kernel](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/julian3833\/5-1-0-submission-submitting-the-test-file) of the series, where we create a trivial 1.0 scoring submission using the test segmentation csv shared by the organizers.\n","786c134e":"### 2.1. **0.89** - ResNet34 + U-net model by [iafoss](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/iafoss)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe most relevant public model at stake right now is the ResNet34 + U-net ensemble proposed by the user [iafoss](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/iafoss) in his series of three kernels. All this work is based on the `fastai` package which, in turn, is fully based on `pytorch`.  \n\n\nGive a quick look to the following table with a summary of the notebooks; we will go into some extra details right below.\n\n\n| Kernel        |   Creation date | Description  | Keywords |\n| ----- |:----|: ---|: ---|\n| [Fine-tuning ResNet34 on ship detection](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/iafoss\/fine-tuning-resnet34-on-ship-detection\/notebook)      |   August 26th |   `Creates a ship detection (classification) model using transfer learning and ResNet34.` | `ResNet34, object detection, learning rate annealing, class imbalance, different input sizes for same network`|\n| [U-net34 (dice 0.87+)](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/iafoss\/unet34-dice-0-87\/notebook)      |  September 1st    |  `Builds a U-net for image segmentation inspired by a fast.ai lesson using the ship detection ResNet34 from previous notebook for the encoder part.

This is a ship detection model (this is, given a picture, it determines whether there is a ship in it or not). The reported precision for the detection task is of ~98%. On the other hand, iafoss does a very focused training on some specific layers using learning rate annealing over images of different resolutions using the same network. Note that this model doesn't fully address the Challenge's problem, which is `image segmentation`.\n\n<!-- TODO: add link to notebook when written --> \n\nThe [second kernel, `U-net34 (dice 0.87+)`](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/iafoss\/unet34-dice-0-87\/notebook), addresses the problem of `image segmentation` itself. Image segmentation is the most evolved of a series of related deep learning \/ computer vision tasks as the picture below shows and we will cover in a *future notebook*.  \n\n<img src='http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/2JauPyI.png' \/>\n\nThe author mentions 2 possible approaches - `U-net` and `SSD` - and explains pros and cons of each of them. After that, he proposes a customized `U-net` model, importing the `ResNet34` of the previous kernel as the encoder part.  This model is trained very selectively only over images with at least one ship, dropping almost %80 of the dataset, based on the class imbalance observation which is discussed in [this previous notebook](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/julian3833\/3-basic-exploratory-analysis) of the series. \n\n`U-net`, as we will see in *another future notebook*, is a fully convolutional network with a symmetric encoding-decoding architecture which works pretty well for `image segmentation`:\n\n<img src='https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/jiSWart.png' width=\"30%\" height=\"30%\"\/>\n\n\nFinally, the [third kernel, `U-net34 submission (0.89 public LB)`](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/iafoss\/unet34-submission-0-89-public-lb) stacks these two models achieving a 0.889 score. So, first, the classifier determines whether a picture has ships or not and, if the picture has ships, the U-net determines where. \n\nThere are few other kernels which are forks of some kernel of these series. In fact, the current top-ranked kernel is just a fork of this work without any addition.\n  \n ### 2.2. **0.847**  - Baseline trivial empty submission\n \n &nbsp;\n \n [Early](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/airbus-ship-detection\/discussion\/62376) on the competition it was publicly known that an empty submission reported an 84.7 score, because of the class imbalance which was discussed on [this kernel](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/julian3833\/3-basic-exploratory-analysis).

The organizers [took action](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/airbus-ship-detection\/discussion\/64388) about this and will change the evaluation set. Meanwhile, they shared the segmentations for the test set. We wrote a [7-lines notebook](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/julian3833\/5-1-0-submission-submitting-the-test-file) which creates a submission with this data, reaching a 1.0 score on the leaderboard (until the new test set is released and the scores are resetted). \n\n\n","9b6406d7":"## 3.

More public models\n&nbsp;\n\nThe most relevant of the rest of the kernels are strongly based on [kmader](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/kmader\/)'s early work. As iafoss, he has built a ship detector using transfer learning and a U-net for image segmentation. kmader didn't publish an ensemble of these two models as iafoss did, but [hmendonca](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/hmendonca) did, obtaining a 85.3 score.  \n\nReturning to kmader's work, the ship detector can be found in the `Transfer Learning for Boat or No-Boat` kernel. It's a `DenseNet169` pretrained net with few extra trained layers around it. It's implemented with `Keras`, and the kernel uses `skimage` and `keras' data augumentation mechanisms`.  On the other hand, the U-net image segmentation model presented in  [Baseline U-net model](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/kmader\/baseline-u-net-model-part-1\/notebook) is a hand-crafted implementation of a basic `U-net` model, also in `Keras`.  This model is splitted in two kernels in fact and, as far as I could understand, it predicts no-ship for every pixels (generating the 0.847 score, as the trivial baseline). \n\n\n| Kernel  |   Description  |   Keywords  |\n| ----- |:----- |: ---|\n| [Baseline U-net model - Part 1](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/kmader\/baseline-u-net-model-part-1\/notebook)    and [Part 2](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/kmader\/from-trained-u-net-to-submission-part-2) |  `U-net model implemented with Keras, splitted in 2 notebooks.
