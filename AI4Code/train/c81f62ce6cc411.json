Were there features that strengthened each other in terms of looking at your feature(s) of interest?\n\nThe multivariate exploration strengthened some of the patterns discovered in the previous bivariate exploration as well as univariate exploration, the relationship between the multiple variables plotted are visualized altogether and information are presented combined. The efficient\/short period of usage for subscribers corresponds to their high concentration on rush hours Monday through Friday, indicating the use is primarily for work commute. The more relaxing and flexible pattern of customer use shows that they're taking advantage of the bike sharing system quite differently from the subscribers, heavily over weekends and in the afternoon, for city tour or leisure purpose probably.        \n\n### Were there any interesting or surprising interactions between features?\n\nThe interactions between features are all supplementing each other and quite make sense when looked at combined, there's no big surprise observed. The usage habit difference between male and female is not that much or obvious throughout the exploration, which could be related to the imbalanced number of female riders\/records compared to male ones. It'd be interesting to see how male and female use the system differently if there were more female data.    ","79bde013":"### What is the ditripution of week-day usage?

The riding habit\/pattern varies a lot between subscribers and customers. Subscribers use the bike sharing system for work commnute thus most trips were on work days (Mon-Fri) and especially during rush hours (when going to work in the morning and getting off work in the afternoon), whereas customers tend to ride for fun in the afternoon or early evenings over weekends.\n\n### Did you observe any interesting relationships between the other features (not the main feature(s) of interest)?\n\n> It is interesting to see that subscribers are slightly older than customers on average but take much shorter\/quicker rides.
