Introduction\n# cancelation cancelation cancelation\nthis is one of the biggest problems that faces the tourism industry which make this industry more risky than other investments , predicting the real demand is a real challenge for the managers in this field and helps them improve their profits, decrease the risk, and be always ready with enough facilities\n\nThis dataset contains two datasets with hotel demand data. One of the hotels (H1) is a resort hotel and the other is a city hotel (H2). Both datasets share the same structure, with 31 variables describing the 40,060 observations of H1 and 79,330 observations of H2. Each observation represents a hotel booking. Both datasets comprehend bookings due to arrive between the 1st of July of 2015 and the 31st of August 2017, including bookings that effectively arrived and bookings that were canceled. Both hotels are located in Portugal: H1 at the resort region of Algarve and H2 at the city of Lisbon\nour main aimfrom this project is to discover the data ,knowing the distributions of our features and try to discover the realationships between them focusing the problem of high_cancelation_rate in order to find advices to decrease this rate or even predict it accordings the different features","57bba07e":"> __let's check the cancelation ratio of each hotel__ ","9b7e8ac1":"> -
