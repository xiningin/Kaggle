In this section we will evaluate four different ensemble machine learning\nalgorithms, two boosting and two bagging methods: <br>\n1. Boosting Methods: AdaBoost (AB) and Gradient Boosting (GBM).\n2. Bagging Methods: Random Forests (RF) and Extra Trees (ET).<br><br>\nWe will use the same test harness as before, 10-fold cross validation. No data standardization\nis used in this case because all four ensemble algorithms are based on decision trees that are\nless sensitive to data distributions","87e3cbc1":"See above, there is an impact of Standardization on SVM and KNN both(We'll try for KNN later, right).\nKNN is not good for low latency systems.","91e5234f":"# Evaluate Algorithms: Standardize Data\nWe suspect that the differing distributions of the raw data may be negatively impacting the skill\nof some of the algorithms. Let\u2019s evaluate the same algorithms with a standardized copy of the\ndataset. This is where the data is transformed such that each attribute has a mean value of zero\nand a standard deviation of one. We also need to avoid data leakage when we transform the\ndata. A good way to avoid leakage is to use pipelines that standardize the data and build the\nmodel for each fold in the cross validation test harness. That way we can get a fair estimation\nof how each model with standardized data might perform on unseen data.","677e3a81":"1.
