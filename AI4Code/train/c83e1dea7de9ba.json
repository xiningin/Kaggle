Semantic similarity is a measure of the degree to which two pieces of text carry the same meaning. As shown in the following image, text of a document is first embedded by a model. And by computing similarity scores across the embeddings of all documents in the corpus, we are able to use this score accordingly to rank the documents.\n\n\n","83320699":"> **\"Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood.

Looking closely to the Silhouette plot, we observe that a lot of the datapoints are wrongly attributed but their Silhouette scores are contained between -0.1 and 0 signifying they are not that badly attributed. Of course, looking at the positive side, the Silhouette scores are not that high either. \n\nFor low number of clusters (4-8), we observe that cluster size is rather uneven, and potentially they need to be divided into more sub clusters. Hence higher number of clusters is prioritised.\n\nThe fact that many datapoints are attributed to the wrong cluster might indicate that a lot of articles are cross-discipline, and therefore don't belong to only one cluster. \n\nFrom this analysis, we have seen that the Silhouette graph is not very conclusive. We pursue by measuring another metric which is the Calinski-Harabasz score, it is defined as ratio between the within-cluster dispersion and the between-cluster dispersion.\n","9f78e840":"### Wordcloud\nWe further plot the wordcloud for each cluster to help us with the interpretation. Since the vocab of USE are wordpieces, it doesn't make too much sense to use them for our wordcloud.

We shall only look at the articles from 2002 onwards, as articles before this year are not as frequent.","030c77e9":"# Embedding\nIn this section, we will proceed with the embeddings of our text data. The idea of embedding is to quantify and categorize semantic similarities between linguistic items based on their distributional properties in large samples of language data. The embedded data are also in a lower dimension as compared to only using classical methods, such as count or tfidf vectorizations Once we have the embeddings, we use them as latent variables for further processing, eg clusterisation, similarity computation with embeded queries... Here, we focus on the aforementioned tasks.\n\nNow comes the question of what embedding to be used. We have previously written a kernel on applying [BioBERT embeddings](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/pmlee2017\/biobert-embedding\/), however without fine-tuning, the performance is not what we expected. In this kernel, we are using USE embeddings and perform a comparison between using only title and both title and abstract.","493d527a":"### Clustering\nWith embeddings done, we can proceed with clustering.

We have performed clustering on the datapoints and have used PCA to reduce the number of dimensions and visualize them in three dimensions. With word cloud, we have been able to get an idea of the topic of each cluster. And finally, we build a demo to test out two settings, one with the embeddings on title only and the other one on both title and abstract.\n\nWe have observed some differences while comparing the returned results between using only title and both title and abstract. From the point of view of a search engine, users often only use several keywords as queries, hence it is more reasonable to compare with embeddings infered from only title because they are also short and precise. On the other hand, the embeddings with title and abstract have proven to be useful in clustering because they contain more information.\n\nThe takeaway message here is that embeddings with title are useful for query searching, and embeddings with title and abstract are useful for clustering.\n\n# Next steps\n\nFrom this study, while embeddings using USE have been able to recommend some relevant articles for the input queries, there is still room for improvement as we have seen that the confidence of the model given by the similarity score is not exceptional, we will proceed by fine tuning the USE model on the CORD19 research challenge corpus, and as a comparison we will carry out the same task with the BioBERT model.
