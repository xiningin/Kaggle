Some interesting observations:\n* Paid apps are not as prominent in the ecosystem as free apps\n* Most of the paid apps are priced on the lower side of the spectrum\n* Very little apps made it to 1B downloads and the vast majority is on the lower side of the spectrum\n* Most ratings are higher than expected, and are distributed between 4 and 5 stars\n\nWe continue our exploration. We deep dive into the effects of putting a price tag on your app - is it a good strategy, or a growth-inhibitor?\nLet's look at amounts, first of all:","5c2e5edd":"We can see which genres are often seen in positive manner (events, puzzles, art), but more interestingly the negatively viewed ones. It seems as users are not as happy with their dating apps (is it the app to blame, in this case, or the user?), navigation apps, trivia apps and tools. Perhaps these categories are worth looking into if you consider building an app to answer a specific need.\n\nWe can inspect the two aspects we looked at so far - priced apps and ratings. Do they have anything to do with one another?","8684cc97":"The distribution definitely gives a good hint of the story to come. Most of the downloaded apps are well within the range of 2-10MB.\nIf we compare the size to the number of installations, or even the amount of reviews, it's easy to conclude that smaller applications gain more attention and interaction. \nLooking at size vs. installs:","c6bc5c7b":"We can observe that something is odd about the description of Rating, with a Max rating of 19.\nLooking for that specific cell we see that the entire row was shifted. So we will simply remove this app for easier handling:\n","59cacd98":"As we see from the test, where p is much smaller than 0.05 (5%), we can reject the null hypothesis, and get to the conclusion that in fact, paid apps have a slightly higher average rating.\n\nSo we have seen so far that paid apps might get a higher rating, but this does not translate to higher download rates. In addition, we saw several genres where user satisfaction is not as high as in others, and could be a white space for someone planning an app from scratch. \nNow we may want to ask the inevitable - does size matter?","8ce0cf41":"Communication apps, such as Messenger, WhatsApp and Line, lead the way with nearly 4 billion installations (!). That's plenty. So do video players (YouTube and the Android default Google Movies) and social networks (Facebook, Twitter etc.). \nGoing back to user satisfaction with apps, we can now cross examine downloads with rating to understand whether those highly common apps are actually pleasing the users or not:","354e8e17":"Now the data is ready for exploration (and possibly training, if we choose to train any model on it).","570109f3":"We see that most variables have very little to no correlation, however reviews and installs do show some correlation, which is logical - we expect more reviews on more downloads. However as we just showed before, it's not a clear correlation, since in some cases the installs are counted, but no one reviews the apps since they aren't put to use.\n\n# Summary\n\nTo summarize this EDA session, we've learned a bit about the Android ecosystem - preference of free apps over paid ones, strong and weak categories, ghost defaulty apps with no users, and user ratings and preferences.\nPlease leave feedback or ask any question if you have!","7f941dd3":"As you might have expected, the most common apps, are also the ones with the generally lower rating score - meaning, the fact that they're highly common and downloaded often, doesn't mean they necessarily work as users hope. Another aspect to consider is factory default apps, like Google Play Movies & TV which boasts a billion download, but if we looked at reviews - we can gain an insight on whether apps are actually used or not.","19e4bfc8":"Let's look at some of the unique values we have, to better understand the dataset:","14e15900":"As expected, free apps generate more user traffic and feedback, which reinforces our previous conclusion - generally, you better keep your app free, and try to generate revenue via in-app purchases.\n\nLet's take a look at apps' ratings, and check what can we learn from that:","b0529fed":"In fact, it seems as the general distribution is similar, with both free apps and paid apps peaking between 4-5 stars. However, we cannot be sure of it, so we can perform a t-test (Welch's) to test it out.\nThe null hypothesis in this case is that both free and paid apps have the same average rating per app.","aa19d0bb":"We'll start off by taking a look at the data we just loaded into our environemnt:","e2846df2":"Not surprisingly, free apps have a higher ceiling, and are not just more prominent in the ecosystem, but also downloaded far more than paid apps. Seems like free apps peak at around 1,000,000 downloads, while paid apps peak at around 1,000 downloads. That's very interesting and good to remember when planning the pricing model of an app, and concidering in-app purchases over prepaid apps.\nWe can take a last look at free vs. paid by looking at how engaged users were - by looking at amount of reviews left for the apps:","0160c413":"As mentioned earlier, we see a surpsingly positive rating distribution: most of the apps get a high rating. But what happens when we look at specific genres?","96874189":"Based on the findings above, we can now restructure our data:","ff6e50c8":"And at size vs. reviews:","52805a1a":"# Welcome ! \n\nIn this notebook, I'll go through my process of preparing the raw data for analysis, and take you through several analytics that will eventually provide some insight on the Google Play Store and can help make decisions when planning your mobile app.","551c5e9e":"Here, we saw that in fact those 1B downloads app, are in practice reviewed in about the same rate as those downloaded 500m times (50%) and not much more than those downloaded \"only\" 100m times (10%). This just gives an indication that these 1B downloads apps aren't necessarily often used, and might be factory default apps that come with the device and users did not even have the option to opt out.\n\nI'll finish off this exploration with a final look, just for fun (and because it can be handy if you intend on applying any ML method later on), at  correlation within our dataset. Highly correlated variables can provide a lot of insight (and often this would be an early step rather than late), and when it comes to modeling ML models, you would usually prefer to avoid using features that are highly correlated, as it will not add a lot of valuable information and will take longer to process.","5926a0dd":"We can take a deeper look at different categories and genres as well. We saw already that some categories may have better ratings, but what about the greater picture? Let's look at install  counts for both, to understand the users priorities:","842ad0ef":"Clearly, there's very little portion of the ecosystem that's paid in advance. But how did these apps perform in terms of installations? Let's look at that breakdown:","9794b048":"# Visual exploration and insight generation\nWe start off by asking a few questions we may ask to understand the ecosystem, and possibly, how to better our app's status (increasing it's download count and improving the rating, things that can potentially increase income).\n\nWe begin with taking a grand view over our data using seaborn's pairplot:"}}
