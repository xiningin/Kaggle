Now, if we consider the potential loss for all possible splits to create a new branch we have thousands of potential splits and losses.\n\n- XGBoost tackles this inefficiency by looking at the distribution of features across all data points in a leaf and using this information to reduce the search space of possible feature splits.\n\n- Although XGBoost implements a few regularization tricks, this speed up is by far the most useful feature of the library, allowing many hyperparameter settings to be investigated quickly. \n\n- This is helpful because there are many hyperparameters to tune which are designed to limit overfitting.","2d4f8ba3":"![Bagging](https:\/\/qph.fs.quoracdn.net\/main-qimg-a5e99250fc4dadd401726a04f4fe2086)","e34c6b81":"\n**If this helped you, your <font color=\"red\"><b>UPVOTES<\/b><\/font> would be very much appreciated \u2013 as they are the source of motivation!**\n\n\n**Happy learning**","25620be2":"We can see that there are only numerical variables in the dataset.","f9b1179d":"- So, we are basically updating the predictions such that the sum of our residuals is close to 0 (or minimum) and predicted values are sufficiently close to actual values.\n\n- Now, we train our second model on the gradient of the error with respect to the loss predictions of the first model. Thus, we should correct the mistakes of the first model. \n\n- This is the core of gradient boosting, and what allows many simple models to compensate for each other\u2019s weaknesses to better fit the data.\n\n- Gradient Boosting is an iterative procedure. So, we will repeat the above process over and over again. Each time we fit a new model to the gradient of the error of the updated sum of models.\n\n- So, gradient boosting is a method for optimizing the function F, but it doesn\u2019t really care about h (since nothing about the optimization of h is defined).

Bagging Vs Boosting**  <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"2\"><\/a>\n\n[Table of Contents](#0.1)\n\n\n- To know bagging and boosting, we need to know ensemble methods.\n\n- Ensemble methods combine several decision trees to produce better predictive performance than utilizing a single decision tree. \n\n- The main principle behind the ensemble model is that a group of weak learners come together to form a strong learner.\n\n- Now, we will talk about two techniques to perform ensemble decision trees. These are as follows:-\n\n  - 1. Bagging\n\n  - 2. Boosting\n  \n- Please refer to my previous kernel - [Bagging vs Boosting](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/prashant111\/bagging-vs-boosting) for detailed discussion on Bagging and Boosting.\n\n[Bagging vs Boosting](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/prashant111\/bagging-vs-boosting)","87d7e260":"\n\n![Evolution of tree-based algorithms](https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/925\/1*QJZ6W-Pck_W7RlIDwUIN9Q.jpeg)"}}
