You can make the first step to the deep learning. So what we gonna do is this.\n\n* make the neural network model\n* using tensorflow library\n* and apply to regression problem\n\nThe altimating goal of this is to predict the housing price, and we'll only focus on numerical variable. And the we will measure the accuracy by mean absolute error.\n\n\nThen Let's do this !!\n","74702885":"The MAE of this model diminish !! hooray !!","13afcf0c":"# Import the data and library","0ce52e7e":"# second step with multiple input\n\nTo improve the accuracy, we can use more variable to input. So in this time, we set the independent variable that every variable that associated with 'Area'. There are several variable match with this feature.\n\n* 'LotArea' : Lot size in square feet\n* 'GrLivArea' : Above grade (ground) living area square feet\n* 'GarageArea': Size of garage in square feet\n* 'PoolArea' : Pool area in square feet\n\n![2](https:\/\/ifh.cc\/g\/0oMwWN.png)","c509952d":"We can get the lowest MAE according to this model !!","586052ba":"# First step with one input\n\nAs you can see, there are so many columns in the dataset. It is very confusing to us!! So at first, we assume that only one input will affect to housing price. Let's pick the one. what variable is appropriate? Just the intuitive thought, I think the square feet of the house will affect to the price. So I'll add the '1stFlrSF', '2ndFlrSF' and set this as independent variable.\n\n* '1stFlrSF' : First Floor square feet\n* '2ndFlrSF' : Second floor square feet\n\nThen how can we make the model?\n\n![1](https:\/\/ifh.cc\/g\/WopRIg.png)","d614dadf":"The mean absolute error of this model is pretty high. We want to make more accurate estimate. what should we do?","6d86ea5b":"# conclusion\n\nWe made three model according to this notebook. As we went to the further step, the accuracy was higher than before. But there are more way to improve the accuracy of predict. It was just tutorial and there are more parameter to adjust. So if you have any suggestion, please write the comment and share it !!","7b746107":"# Third step with hidden layers\n\nIn this time, we add the hidden layers into the model. As putting the hidden layers, we can make nonlinear model. The independent variable is same as model_2.\n\n![3](https:\/\/ifh.cc\/g\/wK4PPK.png)"}}
