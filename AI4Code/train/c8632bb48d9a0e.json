They discover how data can be used to answer questions and solve problems. With the development of computers and an ever increasing move toward technological intertwinement, data analysis has evolved. The development of the relational database gave a new breath to data analysts, which allowed analysts to use SQL (pronounced \u201csequel\u201d or \u201cs-q-l\u201d) to retrieve data from databases.\n\n### Typical job descriptions\nMost jobs in data analytics involve gathering and cleaning data to uncover trends and business insights. The day-to-day data analyst job varies depending on the industry or company or the type of data analytics you consider your specialty. Data analysts may be responsible for creating dashboards, designing and maintaining relationship databases and systems for different departments throughout their organization using business intelligence software, Tableau, and programming.\n\nMost data analysts work with IT teams, management and\/or data scientists to determine organizational goals. They mine and clean data from primary and secondary sources then analyze and interpret results using standard statistical tools and techniques. In most cases, they pinpoint trends, correlations and patterns in complex data sets and identify new opportunities for process improvement. Data analysts must also create reports on their findings and communicate next steps to key stakeholders.\n\n### A Day in the Life of a Data Analyst\n\nThe day-to-day for a data analyst depends on where they work and what tools they work with. Some data analysts don\u2019t use programming languages and prefer statistical software and Excel. Depending on the problems they are trying to solve, some analysts perform regression analysis or create data visualizations. Experienced data analysts are sometimes considered \u201cjunior data scientists\u201d or \u201cdata scientists in training.\u201d In some cases, a data analyst\/scientist could be writing queries or addressing standard requests in the morning and building custom solutions or experimenting with relational databases, Hadoop and NoSQL in the afternoon.\n\n\u201cA big part of my job is creating player projections for Fantasy Baseball. These power the default rankings in our draft rooms and inform my preseason and in-season rankings of players. Our readers and customers of our Fantasy product rely on the accuracy of these projections, so it\u2019s important to have a sound statistical basis for making them.During the season, we have a high degree of interaction with our audience, as a large part of our responsibility is to respond to questions about player value and performance. Statistical analysis informs these recommendations, whether they are made through social media platforms, written and video content, or podcasts\u201d","3853b0a7":"Convert string to numeric form","5b4c701c":"2.2 Average Ratings as per revenue of the company","e5e19bdb":"### Ratings \n1.
