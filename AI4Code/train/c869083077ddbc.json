project is to segment the COVID infections from the Lung CT.\n* Hence, lets just consider the original Lung CT and Infection Masks for further analysis.","efb30a11":"HOUNDSFIELD UNIT:\n\n* We are aware that for 2D images, the unit of measurment is Pixels.\n* Similarly for 3D images, the data is measured in Voxels or Volumetric Pixels.\n* A unit to measure the range of this Voxels is Houndsfield Units(HU), which lie in range of -1000 to +2000.\n* But, for medical images, this HU range should be in range of -1000 to about +400 to avoid getting bones in the images.\n* Hence we shall check whether data is in the required range so that it can be used for futher processing and prediction.\n","09cfe209":"* If we observe the plots of the HU, we can observe that for the sample of images we have considered, HU lies within the permissible range.\n* We don't need to transform the data to bring the HU within the range.\n* This is all the we shall cover in our data analysis part.","14ad13d5":"OBSERVATIONS:\n\nBy reading the above metadata file we are able to observe that we have four different types of images:\n\n* Original Lung CT.\n* Lung Mask.\n* Covid Infection Mask.\n* Lung Mask and Covid Infection mask.","57098de1":"OBSERVATIONS:\n\n* The plots for the Lung CT and the Infection Masks have been shown above.\n* We can observe that the infections in the infection mask images have been indicated by white color.\n* We have plotted the Original Lung and Infection masks only for the first CT.\n* Similarly we can plot them for the remaining 19 CT's as well by specifying the required CT.","4bac5813":"OBSERVATIONS:\n* After reading our data, we were able to observe that our images are rotated by 90 degrees\n* We shall make a change in our read_nii

white and green color.\n* In the third image we are see the infection masks which are marked in white.\n* The final image shows us a combination of lung and infection mask.","3e01947b":"OBSERVATIONS:\n\n* We can observe the image slice size and the number of CT slices in each of the CT's.\n* The images slice sizes are varying which means that we will need to bring the images down to a standard size.\n* Also, the number of slices in each of the CT's vary, this may have and implication onto which segmentation model we use(2D or 3D).","96e14354":"CONCLUSIONS:\n\n* The original data was oriented such that we couln't view the data properly, hence, we re-oriented our data.\n* We have 20 scans of Original CT, Lung Mask, Infection Mask and Lung and Infection Mask each, off which we are only considering Lung and Infection mask because of our problem statement.\n* We are able to observe that the image slices are of different size and each CT has different number of slices.\n* The data is in the required range of HU such that it can be further used.\n* If we observe the CT and Infections masks closely, we can see a lot of black are and diaphragm present in the images, we can crop out only the Region of Interest for our image and not use the rest, this may help is in increasing the processing speed, as it will remove the unwanted parts of the images.\n\n","4bdab5a7":"OBSERVATIONS:\n* We are able to observe that the data has been re oriented \n* Now that we have oriented data, let us take a look at the sample images of ct_scan, lung_mask,
