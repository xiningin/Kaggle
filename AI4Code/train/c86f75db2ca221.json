There are a few recommendations that are common to both the tag-based recommender and WMD Similarity based recommender. Hashtags are generally used in the question body and in our case we have computed WMD similarity on the questions title. A problem with the Word Mover Distance is that it is a computationally intensive function and the time taken to compute the similarity increases with the increase in length of the string. Thus it may not be the best idea to use it on question bodies and it's better to use it on the questions title. Coupling the two - WMD Similarity on questions title + Tag RecSys on questions body (hashtags), can give us a powerful way of computing question similarity. Given a question, what can also be done is that we can find out the most similar question and the professional who answered it, and then compute professional similarity based on professionals headline or professionals industry. They can then be ranked on the basis of the proportion of questions answered within 48 hours. This is especially useful if the same professional comes up as the top recommendation for every question and we can use something like [stable marriage](https:\/\/www.geeksforgeeks.org\/stable-marriage-problem\/) to assign questions to different professionals.","469cd72d":"The markdown cell messes up the formatting of the pseudo code so I'll be using triple quotes","409ecd2e":"### Pseudo Code ","fa5c6329":"## Preprocessing and computing WMD Similarity","7ed68e0f":"One particular advantage of WMD is that it doesn't matter if the question is in the active or the passive voice","41204736":"This is in reference to [this discussion](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/data-science-for-good-careervillage\/discussion\/90249#latest-520960). Some of these questions have been answered in greater detail in different sections of the three notebooks\n\n* **Did you decide to predict Pros given a Question, or predict Questions given a Pro? Why?**\n\nWe are only predicting pros given a question. As per the pseudo code, we iterate through each tagged question, find out similar questions and then recommend professionals - both new and active. It's just something that I decided to base the working of my recommender system on since it's important that every student's question gets answered and in this way we get to ensure that in the best way possible.\n\n* **Does your model address the \"cold start\" problem for Professionals who just signed up but have not yet answered any questions? How'd you approach that challenge?**\n\nYes. In the second part of point number 3 in the pseudo code, we are finding new professionals who are most similar to the ones who are in the list of recommended active professionals. In order to do this this we can create a new feature called industry_headline that is a concatenated string of professionals_industry and professionals_headline. Using this, we can compute the WMD Similarity of the top professionals in reco_active_pros with the ones in new_pros and thus, we can encourage the latter to answer questions on the platform.\n\n* **Did your model have any novel approaches to ensuring that \"no question gets left behind\"?**\n\nFor about 97.3% of questions, we can use both Tag RecSys as well as WMD Similarity. For the rest we can use the latter, since every question will have a question title by default.\n\n* **What types of models did you try, and why did you pick the model architecture that you picked?**\n\nI was addressing one level of complexity\/ one problem at a time and while I was doing my EDA, certain problems such as the enormous number of tags and the multiple variations of each tag, stood out. I realised that metadata in this format is highly useful and it gives us standardised entities in a way. Also, using pretrained word vectors gives us context that is otherwise not available but possible due to transfer learning. I used this approach as it's simple enough to understand, control and debug.\n\n* **Did you engineer any new data features? Which ones worked well for your model?**\n\nFor each of the sections under EDA, multiple features were created to get a better understanding of the data. For the recommender system, we created the feature 'less_than_2_days', that is used to rank professionals based on the proportion of questions they have answered within 48 hours. \n\n* **Is there anything built into your approach to protect certain Professionals from being \"overburdened\" with a disproportionately high share of matches?**\n\nYes, this is precisely what point number 3 in the pseudo code deals with. The first part *Exploits* - questions are recommended to those professionals who are most likely to answer based on similarity and proportion of questions answered within 48 hours and the second part *Explores* - finds professionals who are most similar to the ones we expect an answer from.\n\n* **What do you wish you could use in the future (that perhaps we could try out on our own as an extension of your work)?**\n\nI have mentioned some of this in the Insights and Strategy sections within each sub-heading under EDA. With that being said, I would have also liked to work on text summarization. Given similar questions, extract relevant statements from the bodies of their answers and present them to students who have matching queries. Here are some interesting articles that I found on [Medium](https:\/\/medium.com\/jatana\/unsupervised-text-summarization-using-sentence-embeddings-adb15ce83db1) and [AnalyticsVidhya](https:\/\/www.analyticsvidhya.com\/blog\/2018\/11\/introduction-text-summarization-textrank-python\/).","6872fd1e":"To make recommendations based on a question:\n\n- Find questions that are similar to the one under consideration\n- Find if the similar questions have been answered\n- If yes, find if the professional is active.
