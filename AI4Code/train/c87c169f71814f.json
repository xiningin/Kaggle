As we would expect, right before ability hits 70 the player value ramps up.\n\n\nWhat might be more interesting, is looking at which of these players is a pretty good value and which ones are rip-offs. It appears Kroos is an excellent pick with a value much below his counterparts but his overall skill level is still at 90. Ramos, Kane, and Courtois are also pretty good deals. \n\nThere are no clear outliers for those that have low ability but high value. The closest is De Bruyne, whose value is 102 million at 91 skill. Hazard (93 million), De Gea (72 million), Modric (67 million), and Ramos (51 million) all have the same ability at a significantly lower value. Mbappe has a similar issue.","0738532a":"#### Club Representation\n\nNo surprise that the top Spanish players are playing at the top three clubs in Spain arguably the [strongest league in Europe in recent history](https:\/\/iffhs.de\/the-strongest-national-league-of-the-world-spains-primera-division-again\/).

Greek players also tend to be at Greek clubs. One neat thing is this is the first time in these groups we have a club (Arsenal) who has team members from three different countries in the same group.","2eb54b37":"Now let's take a look at ability. The boxplots follow the ones from above. Left attacking mid still has a high median, and left forward has a high median. Additionally, right forward seems to also have a pretty strong median. \n\nThis and the above boxplot seem to indicate that there is a bit of bias in assigning value and ability to different positions.","0bdde1b4":"#### Club Representation\n\nAfter looking at a few of these I'm able to pick up on a theme.

If this data is to be believed, Switzerland and Denmark should be a pretty tight race for 1st. Both teams had impressive performances at the 2018 world cups. Switzerland made it out of a group with Brazil before falling to Sweden and Demark drawing France (The year's champion) and only losing to Croatia (the runner up) after penalties. More recently, Switzerland had a dominating 5-2 win over a very talented Belgian team in the last group stage match of the Nations League. Although... the Republic of Ireland is off to a good start by winning their first two games. It should be interesting to see if they can keep up the pace. ","5e1bb07d":"#### Player Ratings\n\nFrance is probably going to be the favorite in this group after coming off a world cup championship and containing several young, talented players. This boxplot also illustrates the gap between France's skill level and their competition. Iceland will try to replicate last year's success at the Euros where they made it to the quarterfinals before losing to France. To get there, they'll have to first get by Turkey who is off to a perfect start.","eb09c6d1":"### Group B  <a name=\"F\"><\/a>\n\nHere are results for Group B as of March 27th, 2019:\n\n| Position | Team | Played | Won | Drawn | Lost | GF | GA | GD | Points | Qual |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | \n| 1 | Ukraine | 2 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 4 | Y | \n| 2 | Luxembourg | 2 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 3 | 3 | 0 | 3 | Y | \n| 3 | Portugal | 2 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 2 | N |  \n| 4 | Serbia | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | N |\n| 5 | Lithuania | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | -1 | 0 | N | ","a6c9f272":"#### Club Representation\n\nGermany seems to have its best players concentrated at Bayern and a good share going to other top European clubs.

Belarus, Estonia, and Northern Ireland seem to have players pretty spread out with no club having more than 2 of their respective players.","4691baed":"# FIFA 19 Players by Country","0d34c919":"#### Club Representation\n\nI have to say I'm a bit surprised to see such high team concentration given the trend in the previous groups.

This actually intuitively makes sense. It might take a higher rating for players outside of the top 5 nations to enter the data. As far as a country's performance goes, a team is only as good as the 11 players it has on the field and those subbed in. \n\nA better approach to look at national team strength could be to look at the top 18 players or so. Ideally we would look at the players actually on the roster for each of these countries, but I was too tired to look up all of the teams rosters, and given changes between games and the lack of data on some countries' players, this seemed like a reasonable approximate.","794177e1":"Now looking at the top 18 players from each country, this is a lot more like what we would expect with England having players rated above their group. This is the approach I'll take for the other groups as well. Looks like Montenegro has an outlier much higher than the team median due to S. Savi\u0107 and his 80+ rating. The others are pretty bunched up in comparison.\n\nThere's not really enough games played right now to see if the FIFA 19 player data is reflective of the team's performance, but we'll have to look and see how these track over time.","5518d4f0":"#### Player Ratings\n\nNo surprise to see Germany and Netherlands with such high player ratings as the former won the World Cup in 2014 and the latter is the [most successful team to never win the world cup](http:\/\/soccerly.com\/article\/finnal\/netherlands-the-best-team-to-never-win-the-world-cup). It is interesting that Germany has such a rating given it was actually in Pot 2 in the draw due to a poor performance in the [UEFA Nations League](https:\/\/www.uefa.com\/uefanationsleague\/season=2019\/teams\/team=47\/index.html) and [2018 World Cup](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Germany_at_the_FIFA_World_Cup).

Sweden topped a group with Germany and Mexico and eventually made it to the quarterfinals. Spain, after getting to the to the top of their group failed to advance past Russia in a penalty shootout. The other three countries will be hoping to make it into the Euros after failing to qualify for the world cup in 2018.","86a275de":"#### Player Ratings\n\nThis looks like a group without a clear favorite. Poland is off to a good start with 2 wins in 2 games, but Austria and Slovenia, who look similar in player rating distribution, have yet to win in their two games. Austria just suffered a convincing 4-2 defeat to Israel whose 75th percentile is below the weakest Austrian player in the top 18. We'll see if they can move up in the remaining games.","868be985":"#### Club Representation\n\nUkraine seems to have most of its best players playing locally, with 7 players competing at Shakhtar Donetsk and 6 at Dynamo Kyic, both located in Ukraine.
