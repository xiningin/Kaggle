I'm on the last course and was encouraged to do a case study. I am so excited about this! I've been waiting to get to put all the knowledge I've gained through this program together. I have enjoyed hitting my head in R, then finding exactly what I needed, over and over until I achieved a final product I am very proud of.\n\nHere was the business objective of this case study: \nUsing public dataset from competing organizations using similar smart technology devices to measure health, this proposal aims to uncover insights in trends that apply to the Bellabeat application and how this could shape Bellabeat\u2019s marketing strategy for the Bellabeat app.\n\nHere is a link to the RMarkdown case study report I created <https:\/\/65df3ae270264a47bac54858d283978d.app.rstudio.cloud\/file_show?path=%2Fcloud%2Fproject%2FBellabeat-Case-Study.html>\n\nBelow is the code on how I processed the data.\n\nThis was my first big project for data analysis with R and outside of a previous job I had. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience!"}}
