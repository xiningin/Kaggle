This will be decided later.","4fdbf4b4":"### Principal component analysis\n\nIt may be that the poorly reproducible results in the previous step are caused by the huge amount of features and small sample size. It may be a good idea then to try to reduce them via PCA or SVD.","718ce475":"Interestingly, even though SVC performed decently over the pca components, it seems that they are completely unusable with neural networks. On the other hand the network over the frequency domain signals performs decently but yet worse than SVC.","44083526":"### Inspection and visualisation\n\nLet's now print and check dataset structure and column types.","c223087e":"Finally, it was reported in the dataset description that classes were unbalanced, so I need to know how much to decide metrics and\/or further preprocessing steps.","7980595f":"Now a couple of stars from the two classes will be plotted to see how they look like and get an idea about preprocessing and classification steps. I will be also computing the time vector given the sampling interval provided above.","74425627":"## Classification phase\n\nIt is now time to start the classification phase. The reason why I haven't provided any statistical analysis in the previous section is because I am about to classify time signals over rows and not columns. Every row is thus completely independent from the others and there is no meaning in computing, for example, a correlation matrix between columns. So feature engineering in terms of columns selection is not possible here because significative time ranges for a star classification may be useless for another. Only meaningful features engineering is signal processing, like computing the power spectrum or filtering as I did above.\n\nSo first of all, what makes a star worth considering the possibility of an exoplanet? Imagine a star with a planet orbiting around it. When the planet gets in between the camera and the star the perceived luminosity dims and we see dropdowns in the star flux signal and the star is considered a candidate for further evaluation. Classifiers could then dicriminate whether a star has an exoplanet by looking at such drops as in the image above. A further evaluation criterion can definetely be the periodicity of such dimmings. A planet does, in fact, orbit with a fixed orbital period and will then dim the flux at periodic intervals. The way to look for periodic patterns is to get the spectral estimates of the signals and use it as features. In this regard another fact must be pointed out. As already said, signals span over approximately only sixty-five days due to malfuctioning. Thus, it will be impossible to find periodic patterns or even a single dimming if the orbital period is greater than such time span.","5a8862f6":"### Preprocessing\n\nAs seen in the image above, the scale of the signals are very different one another so, for classification's sake, it is important to scale them to Z-Score units to make them coherent. In addition, some stars present constant or linear trends during their time span. These will not bring information to the classification process and may actually even hinder it. So, I am also going to remove them by dividing every signal in thirty equals parts and detrending them piecewisely. As segments increase the more detrending will be affected by noise and might <i>over-average<\/i> the signal loosing pieces of information, on the other hand with few segments detrending may not be precise because it could affect segments with different trends (e.g. quick ups and downs).\nIt is important to state that generaly such preprocessing step are carried out over the columns, on the other hand, I need to perform them over the rows since these are time signals.","1c58efbd":"# Exoplanet Hunting in Deep Space\n## Classification of Kepler labelled time series data\n***Francesco Pudda, 21\/05\/2020***","23aac02c":"## Discussion\n\nThis classification task has been very hard. The fact that classification was about time series excluded every typical feature engineering technique given that we had to consider the whole signals. I was only able to filter or reduce dimensionality to try different models. Such number of features might have probably caused overfitting that I tried to reduct by regularization, and keeping the training set size as large as possible during cross-validation.\n\nExcept for the neural network with PCA components, similar cross-validation scores were found by using SVC or MLP with different features, but their variability was so high to make me think that they were completely sample dependendent and so dependent on the randomicity of the cross-validation procedure.\n\nEven if not shown in the report I also tried out more techniques like different kind of filtering that changed performances little no zero (and if so, in negative), and simultaneous over-\/undersampling techniques like <i>SMOTENN<\/i> in the <i>imbalanced-learn<\/i> library that did not help but increasing overfitting. I also tried more networks but power demands was too high to run them on my laptop.\n\nGiven the small number of falses it would be interesting to inspect them to see why the classifier have wrongly labelled them.","b83f41d1":"### Deep learning networks\n\nWe saw that SVC performs pretty good even though not outstandingly. It could be possible then to extend the scikit-learn possibilities by using the Keras deep learning library able to build efficient and complex neural networkd. The approach will be similar to the previous one. I am going to to build a model and tune its hyperparameters by the combine use of <i>Keras + SciKit-Learn<\/i> cross-validation techniques. Unfortunately I will not be able to build very complex model that were reported to be very good for time series classification [11][nnmod] because they are too slow to run on my machine and almost impossible on IBM Watson Studio.\n\nTraining will be a little bit trickier here. Indeed, I need to try different networks that must be built separately, each one with different hyper parameters. I am going to use the <i>KerasClassifier<\/i> class that will let me take advantage of scikit handy crossvalidation functions.\n\n[nnmod]: https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1809.04356","aeaa32ef":"Interestingly, the explained variance raises much quicker in the frequency domain than in the time domain. We would barely need 200 components to have more than 90% of explained variance in contrast to approximately 2000. Part of such difference surely lies in the fact that the frequency domain diplays half the features of the other, but the shape of the curve is much more steeper anyway. That will be our candidate in next classifications steps. Given the above graph I arbitrarily choose as many components to obtain 95% of explained variance.","833d050f":"Now I am going to create the crossvalidation instances using a stratified shuffle split. Shuffle splits were chosen so as to decide the ratio of randomly sample the stars to keep in the validation set and the number of iterations indipendently one another. Given the huge number of features, I had to use as much of the training set as possible and keep the validation set size to a minimum. Considering that there are only thirty-seven positive samples I couldn't opt for less then ten percent, though, yielding three or four positive samples for each iteration.\n\nIn addition, since <i>Scikit-Learn<\/i> estimators' fit function doesn't return a copy of the instance but <i>self<\/i> I used <i>deepcopy<\/i> to create several instances the the cross-validation one.","ab24d7bf":"Although detrending and scaling went good, and signals are now centered around zero, time representation may not be a very good candidate for classification. Next step will then be to compute the power spectrum density of each signal and filter it. The idea behind filtering is that dimmings in flux come at a certain period which can be very different in range, but each one happens relatively quickly and we must be able to capture it, hence the necessity to keep some high frequencies.\nThe filter will be an IIR bandpass butterworth filter of eighth order with cutoff frequency $0.00001 Hz$ and $0.00013 Hz$. The reason for this filter is that I prefer a less sloped transition band than ripples in the passing or stopping band (see [7][butter] and [8][cheby] for more information). The window choice is pretty standard in signal processing because the passband and stopband ripple size are not affected by the window length but by how the coefficients roll off (more at [9][kaiser]). Finally I used <i>filtfilt<\/i> function to apply the filter twice, forwards and backwards, in order to have a zero phase filter; for this reason I had to set the filtering order to four so that applied twice yieds an eighth order one.\n\n[butter]: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Butterworth_filter\n[cheby]: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Chebyshev_filter\n[kaiser]: https:\/\/www.quora.com\/Why-is-kaiser-window-superior-to-other-window-functions?share=1","adae86c0":"### Support vector machine\n\nFirst estimator that will be tried is <i>Support Vector Machine<\/i>. It is a quite popular estimator that perform pretty well in most case and it is often used for time series classification as in in the popular MatLab toolbox Brainstorm where it implemented by default [10][SVM].\n\nThere is one major problem that could ruin the accuracy of the models: the huge imbalance. Positive samples are, in fact, less than 1% in both training and test set. Unfortunately little can be done in this regard. Oversampling the positive samples may cause overfitting, on the other hand down sampling may bring to underfitting. There are also mixed technique that were not tried out because final results were overall good.\n\n<b>NOTE:<\/b> The dataset is not that huge but the number of features is, so the process will be very slow.

Measure units are not provided so it was necesarry to have a look at Kaggle discussions forum [4][disc] and Wikipedia's page about Kepler telescope [5][kepl]. From there, I was able to find the sampling time interval $1765.5 s$, from which I calculated the time span of the signals, roughly sixty-five days. Regarding the y-axis measure unit, in Kaggle it is stated it is <i>flux<\/i> without specifying any further (maybe supposing that insiders would know it precisely). Although not important as far as classification is concerned, in this context flux has units of $W m^{-2}$ [6][flux] and probably such signals are given in logarithmic scale even if I was not able to confirm it.\n\nI am now splitting the datasets based on this piece of information and converting it to a numpy array, more practical for numerical elaboration.

For centuries scientists, philosophers, and writers suspected that extrasolar planets existed, but with the technology of the time there was no way of knowing that or how similar they might have been to the planets of the Solar System. The first possible evidence of an exoplanet was noted in 1917, but was not recognized as such. The first confirmation of detection occurred in 1992 and hundreds and hundreds more exoplanets have been confirmed since then. As of May, 16 2020, 4266 exoplanets have been confirmed [1][nexo]. The discovery of exoplanets has made interest for extraterrestrial life rise up. In particular, special interest is paid to planets that orbit in a star's habitable zone, where it is possible for liquid water to exist on the surface [2][life]. In this project I am going to show some characteristics of stars with exoplanet and some possible models to classify them.\n\n[nexo]: exoplanet.eu\/catalog\/\n[life]: www.nytimes.com\/2015\/01\/07\/science\/space\/as-ranks-of-goldilocks-planets-grow-astronomers-consider-whats-next.html","4cd0cc2d":"It is clear that none of the above estimators is a reliable one, in fact they all yield very different scores on different iterations often yielding same results. This is surely due to the very small positive sample size causing very different f1 scores if only one sample is wrongly classified. This step was not useless anyway, in fact, we understood that filtering this data didn't bring anything good to classification, so I won't be using filtered signals in later processing stages."}}
