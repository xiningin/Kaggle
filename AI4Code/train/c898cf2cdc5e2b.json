It also notes that the crisis caused by the disease has increased social inequalities, exposing the inability of governments to help the poorest populations. The moment, he believes,it offers an opportunity for the left, \"because it is necessary for the state to play a greater role than before\".\n\n#What have we learned from the pandemic?\n\nWe are still learning, because the pandemic is not over yet. We learned that most countries - rich and poor - were unprepared to face the pandemic. The United States reacted especially badly. Virtually all Asian countries - democratic and non-democratic - have done a much better job than European countries. No one died of coronavirus in Vietnam. There have been very few deaths in Thailand. Taiwan, Japan and South Korea did very well. We must ask ourselves if there is anything we can learn from Asian countries. The pandemic also showed and has been showing that health systems were not prepared for the pandemic after so much austerity, lack of investment and privatization.\n\n#Why were Asian countries better prepared?\n\nHard to know. One reason is perhaps because they had to deal with the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) epidemic, which did not affect Western countries much. Asian governments, those that are and those that are not democratic, tend to be more technocratic and act more quickly. The Asian population also trusts governments more and is more willing to follow the guidelines of social isolation. A disciplined population helps.\n\n#Will the pandemic make the world even more unequal?\n\nAs the pandemic started in China six months ago, we already know that it mainly affected the poorest and the essential workers, who are most exposed to contamination. In the USA, it is very clear how the poorest people are most affected. In fact, one of the effects of the pandemic is an increase in inequality, which can easily continue to increase in the coming months, because most of the people who lost their jobs were already less skilled and low-income.https:\/\/translate.google.com.br\/translate?hl=en&sl=pt&u=https:\/\/oglobo.globo.com\/mundo\/india-tem-quase-700-mil-casos-da-covid-19-e-terceiro-pais-mais-afetado-do-mundo-1-24518158&prev=search&pto=aue\n","ccd9ca41":"#The 20 countries with the lowest gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in 2019 - Published by H. Plecher, Jun 2, 2020\n\nIn 2019, `South Sudan once again reported the lowest per-capita GDP ever`, closely-followed by Burundi and Malawi. All three countries struggle economically, because of poorly developed infrastructure and a low standard of living.\n\n\n#GDP per capita as an indicator\n\nA country\u2019s gross domestic product, often referred to as GDP for short, is a means to measure the market value of goods and services a country has produced over a certain period of time. It is an important key indicator for a country\u2019s economic status and development. GDP per capita is the breakdown of GDP to the country\u2019s total population, showing how much each of the inhabitants have theoretically obtained. GDP per capita is a popular measure of the standard of living, prosperity, and overall well-being in a country. A high GDP per capita indicates a high standard of living, a low one indicates that a country is struggling to supply its inhabitants with everything they need. https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/256547\/the-20-countries-with-the-lowest-gdp-per-capita\/","e053ee0b":"#TB Preventive Therapy\n\nThe Use of Preventive Therapy for Tuberculous Infection in the United States Recommendations of the Advisory Committee for Elimination of Tuberculosis \n\nThe appropriate use of preventive therapy played a crucial role in efforts to eliminate tuberculosis in the United States by the year 2010. When taken as prescribed, isoniazid preventive therapy is highly effective in preventing latent tuberculous infection from progressing to clinically apparent disease. In controlled trials conducted by the Public Health Service in ordinary clinical and public health settings, isoniazid preventive therapy reduced the incidence of disease by 54 per cent-88 per cent. The main reason for the variation in efficacy appears to have been the amount of medication actually taken during the year in which isoniazid was prescribed. In a trial conducted in eastern Europe among infected adults with abnormal chest radiographs, a 12-month course of isoniazid preventive therapy was 75 per cent effective among all persons assigned to the regimen and 93 per cent effective among those who were compliant with therapy. Similarly, isoniazid preventive therapy was estimated to be 98 per cent effective among children in Houston and in recently infected nursing home patients who were compliant with therapy. Isoniazid preventive therapy has been shown to be effective for long periods and to be reasonably cost-effective. https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/mmwr\/preview\/mmwrhtml\/00001643.htm","49d76890":"![](https:\/\/www.accord.org.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/accord-covid-19-infographic-10-jun-2020_4.png)\nCountry profile: The impact of COVID-19 on stability and the peace process in South Sudan, by Neyma Mildred Mahomed Ali -\naccord.org.za https:\/\/www.accord.org.za\/analysis\/impact-of-covid-19-on-stability-and-the-peace-process-in-south-sudan\/","a5e9ad3a":"Although the overall number of confirmed cases is still relatively low, the spread of COVID-19 in South Sudan is raising concerns because of limited public health facilities, an already dire humanitarian situation, an increase in communal clashes and a fragile peace process.

Today, the country relies heavily on agriculture with the majority living in rural areas, but violence, the lack of food, and inefficient water supply often cause famine and illnesses. Since South Sudan thus cannot produce and export goods efficiently and sufficiently, GDP per capita does not even reach four-figure levels, despite a quite low number of inhabitants. NGOs and government agencies are trying to improve their situation by offering funding and education, but significant improvement has yet to be seen. https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/256547\/the-20-countries-with-the-lowest-gdp-per-capita\/","dff6efa4":"#Why is Isoniazid prescribed?\n\nIsoniazid is used with other drugs to treat tuberculosis (TB; a serious infection that affects the lungs and sometimes other parts of the body). Isoniazid is also used with other drugs to treat people with latent (resting or nongrowing) TB including those in close contact with people who have active TB, a positive tuberculin skin test, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and those with pulmonary fibrosis (scarring of the lungs with an unknown cause). Isoniazid is in a class of medications called antituberculosis agents.

Two months later, there are 1 604 confirmed cases, with 15 recovered and 19 deaths. In response to the first case, a COVID-19 National Task Force was established to coordinate a government-wide response to the pandemic. A nationwide curfew was put in place, the borders were closed and restrictions were imposed on interstate travel.\n\nOne of the ways in which COVID-19 had a negative impact on the implementation of the peace process was felt when the government decided to suspend the training of the unified forces as a precautionary measure \u2013 a decision that affected 29 000 combatants. \n\nOne of the challenges facing South Sudan in its efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19 is its porous borders. Cross-border control and surveillance mechanisms have been increased in an attempt to reduce the illegal crossing of traders, especially along the country\u2019s borders with the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Uganda. Isolation centres have been established to quarantine those found to have illegally crossed the border. Instability in neighbouring countries is also resulting in refugees moving into South Sudan.https:\/\/www.accord.org.za\/analysis\/impact-of-covid-19-on-stability-and-the-peace-process-in-south-sudan\/","f4e7b230":"The spread of COVID-19 in South Sudan is adding further stress to existing humanitarian challenges. Before the advent of COVID-19, the sub-region suffered from an invasion of locusts, and projections then were that 5.5 million South Sudanese would go hungry without humanitarian assistance. The situation is compounded by the escalation of local community violence in certain parts of the country, with 450 incidents recorded between January and May 2020. The closing of borders to stem the spread of the virus has also created shortages of basic goods in some border areas between South Sudan and Sudan.\n\nAs a result of these shortages, and with South Sudan being a landlocked country, the government decided to reopen the country\u2019s airspace. The economic outlook was worsened by the drop in global crude oil prices, which is the biggest generator of revenue for the government, accounting for 98 per cent of the state\u2019s budget. However, the World Bank last month approved a grant of USD40 million to provide income security to the most vulnerable households. https:\/\/www.accord.org.za\/analysis\/impact-of-covid-19-on-stability-and-the-peace-process-in-south-sudan\/"}}
