A *function* is a **mapping between an input set and an output set**. The special condition of a function is that an element of the input set is related to exactly one element of the output set. For example, Figure below shows two sets such that an element of the output set is the square of an element that belongs to the input set.\n\n![alt text](https:\/\/yaser-rahmati.gitbook.io\/~\/files\/v0\/b\/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com\/o\/spaces%2F-M2g31CUvdCruJm660Ot%2Fuploads%2FGd8f5ONBfId4mMEQNKwv%2F957.png?alt=media&token=acce0016-1852-4b01-a32f-c95aacfb2b0c \"Function\")\n\nUsing the familiar function notation, we\u2019d write this function as $f(x) = x^2$, where $x$ is the **independent variable** quantity. So $f(2) = 4$, $f(100) = 10000$, and so on. \n\nWe refer to $x$ as the **independent variable** quantity because we\u2019re free to assume a value for it as long as that value is within its domain.\n\nFunctions can also be defined in terms of **multiple variables**. For example, $f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2$ defines a function of two variables, $x$ and $y$.\n\n## Domain and Range of a Function\n\nThe domain of a function is the set of input values that the independent variable can validly assume. The output set of a function is called the **range**. \n\n* For example, the domain of the function $f(x) = 1\/x$ is all nonzero real and complex numbers because $\/0$ isn\u2019t defined. \n* The range is formed by the set of values obtained by substituting each number in the domain into $1\/x$, so in this case it is also all nonzero real and complex numbers.","fd38db0f":"Hense, the limit of $f(x)$ at $x = 0$ is calculated as below:","5d6431cc":"We import the $Limit$ and $Symbol$ classes, as well as $S$, which is a special SymPy class that contains the definition of infinity (positive and negative) and other special values. Then, we create a symbol object, $x$, to represent $x$. We create the Limit object , passing it three arguments: \n\n* $1\/x$, the variable $x$, \n* The value at which we want to calculate the function\u2019s limit (infinity, given by $S.Infinity$).\n\nThe result is returned as an unevaluated object. To find the value of the limit, we use the $doit()$ method:","3bf354ce":"## Finding the Limit of Functions\n\nWe can find limits of functions in *SymPy* by creating objects of the *Limit* class as follows:","db4641ad":"## Finding the Derivative of Functions\n\nThe derivative of a function $y = f(x)$ expresses the rate of change in the dependent variable, $y$, with respect to the independent variable, $x$. It\u2019s denoted as either $f\u2032(x)$ or $dy\/dx$. We can find the derivative of a function by creating an object of the Derivative class. Let\u2019s use the previous function representing the motion of a car as an example:","85d0e111":"and as we approach $0$ for $x$ from the negative side, the value of the limit approaches negative infinity.

That is, the integral of a function is another function whose derivative is the original function. Mathematically, it\u2019s written as below:\n\n$$ F(x)=\\int f(x)dx $$\n\nThe **definite integral**, on the other hand, is the integral:\n\n$$ \\int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx $$\n\nwhich is really $F(b) \u2212 F(a)$, where $F(b)$ and $F(a)$ are the values of the antiderivative of the function at $x = b$ and at $x = a$, respectively.\n\nHere\u2019s how we can find the integral $\u222bkxdx$ , where $k$ is a constant term:","8ee7438e":"We call the $doit()$ method on the unevaluated Derivative object to find the derivative:"}}
