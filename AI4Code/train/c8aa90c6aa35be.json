New Jersey is growing **fast**. California and Washington seemed like they were in trouble at first, but as of today they've got around 2500 confirmed cases each, whereas NJ is closing in on 4k.

Feel free to select any period you want and see how many infected and dead there were per country.","0b7ca089":"<a id=world><\/a>\n## How is coronavirus evolving in different countries?\n\nCOVID19 emerged in China and stayed there for quite some time. It was only after weeks that it emerged to neighbouring countries like South Korea, and later to Europe (currently the epicenter) and the rest of the world. We'll have a look at different countries where COVID19 has had a considerable effect: China, South Korea, Italy, Iran, Spain, USA, and Brazil. \n\nFrom the following plots we can see that China has stabilized both the number of confirmed cases and the number of deaths. South Korea and and Iran seemed like potential problematic spots initially, but they managed to control the spread of the virus. Italy and Spain, on the other hand, are still showing an exponential growth of confirmed cases even though both countries are under full lockdown. What's worse, their citizens are dying at a higher rate. Why could that be?\n\nThe number of infected people in the US is growing quickly; in a few days it will surely surpass Italy and China. However, the mortality rates in the US are rather low. Maybe the virus hasn't had enough time to kill the infected, or maybe the US health system is better prepared. We'll see in the following days.\n\nWe included Brazil for 2 reasons: first, Brazil is a huge country, similar to the US in population and in politcal leadership, so it will be interesting to see whether Brazil will follow USA's numbers; second, Brazil's health system is knowingly worse than that of first world countries \u2013 will Brazil be able to handle this pandemic better than Italy or Spain?","d20f76ec":"Coronavirus is growing very fast in the US. If you've watched TV or read the news lately you probably think most cases come from New York. Right? Well, the data shows that only about half of the infections are from NY. Which other states are suffering from the epidemic the most?","f0051285":"The plot below shows very clearly how China was able to control the spread of the virus. We can also see how South Korea, Italy and Iran all had their first cases around the same time, but the evolution since has been very different. Kudos to South Korea and Iran for controlling the coronavirus rapidly!","60770db4":"# Interactive visualizations of coronavirus data using Altair\n\nIn this notebook we'll create some interesting graphs to gain some insight about the COVID-19 dataset.
