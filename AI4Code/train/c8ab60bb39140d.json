Be carefull with some unbalanced dataset a simple random split could cause inaccurate evaluation during the validation.","e6256cf3":"I used the [Keras Sequential API](https:\/\/keras.io\/guides\/sequential_model\/), where you have just to add one layer at a time, starting from the input.\n\nThe first is the convolutional [(Conv2D)](https:\/\/keras.io\/api\/layers\/convolution_layers\/convolution2d\/) layer. It is like a set of learnable filters. I choosed to set 32 filters for the two firsts conv2D layers and 64 filters for the two last ones. Each filter transforms a part of the image (defined by the kernel size) using the kernel filter. The kernel filter matrix is applied on the whole image. Filters can be seen as a transformation of the image.\n\nThe CNN can isolate features that are useful everywhere from these transformed images (feature maps).\n\nThe second important layer in CNN is the pooling [(MaxPool2D)](https:\/\/keras.io\/api\/layers\/pooling_layers\/max_pooling2d\/) layer. This layer simply acts as a downsampling filter. It looks at the 2 neighboring pixels and picks the maximal value. These are used to reduce computational cost, and to some extent also reduce overfitting. We have to choose the pooling size (i.e the area size pooled each time) more the pooling dimension is high, more the downsampling is important.\n\nCombining convolutional and pooling layers, CNN are able to combine local features and learn more global features of the image.\n\n[Dropout](https:\/\/keras.io\/api\/layers\/regularization_layers\/dropout\/) is a regularization method, where a proportion of nodes in the layer are randomly ignored (setting their wieghts to zero) for each training sample. This drops randomly a propotion of the network and forces the network to learn features in a distributed way. This technique also improves generalization and reduces the overfitting.\n\n['relu'](https:\/\/keras.io\/api\/layers\/activations\/) is the rectifier (activation function max(0,x). The rectifier activation function is used to add non linearity to the network.\n\nThe [Flatten layer](https:\/\/keras.io\/api\/layers\/reshaping_layers\/flatten\/) is use to convert the final feature maps into a one single 1D vector. This flattening step is needed so that you can make use of fully connected layers after some convolutional\/maxpool layers. It combines all the found local features of the previous convolutional layers.\n\nIn the end I used the features in two fully-connected (Dense) layers which is just artificial an neural networks (ANN) classifier. In the last layer(Dense(10,activation=[\"softmax\"](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Softmax_function))) the net outputs distribution of probability of each class.","c2ff41de":"<a id=\"ch3\"><\/a>\n# 3.

The higher LR, the bigger are the steps and the quicker is the convergence. However the sampling is very poor with an high LR and the optimizer could probably fall into a local minima.\n\nIts better to have a decreasing learning rate during the training to reach efficiently the global minimum of the loss function.\n\nTo keep the advantage of the fast computation time with a high LR, i decreased the LR dynamically every X steps (epochs) depending if it is necessary (when accuracy is not improved).\n\nWith the ReduceLROnPlateau function from Keras.callbacks, i choose to reduce the LR by half if the accuracy is not improved after 3 epochs.","7bfb6134":"## Feedback\n* **Your feedback is much appreciated**\n* **<b><font color='green'>Please UPVOTE if you LIKE this notebook<\/font><\/b>**\n* **Comment if you have any doubts or you found any errors in the notebook**","1b6a8bad":"In order to avoid overfitting problem, we need to expand artificially our handwritten digit dataset.

Introduction\n\nThis is a 5 layers Sequential [Convolutional Neural Network](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Convolutional_neural_network) for digits recognition trained on [MNIST dataset](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/MNIST_database). I chose to build it with keras API (Tensorflow backend) which is very intuitive. Firstly, I will prepare the data (handwritten digits images) then i will focus on the CNN modeling and evaluation.\n\n**For computational reasons, i set the number of steps (epochs) to 5, if you want to achieve 99+% of accuracy set it to 30.**\n\nThis Notebook follows three main parts:\n\n* The data preparation\n* The CNN modeling and evaluation\n* The results prediction and submission\n\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/2\/27\/MnistExamples.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\"\/>\n<br>","f83f1f0a":"For the data augmentation, i choosed to :\n   - Randomly rotate some training images by 10 degrees\n   - Randomly  Zoom by 10% some training images\n   - Randomly shift images horizontally by 10% of the width\n   - Randomly shift images vertically by 10% of the height\n   \nI did not apply a vertical_flip nor horizontal_flip since it could have lead to **misclassify symetrical numbers** such as 6 and 9.\n\nOnce our model is ready, we fit the training dataset .","14540a1d":"Let's investigate for errors.\n\nI want to see the most important errors . For that purpose i need to get the difference between the probabilities of real value and the predicted ones in the results.","263ec5fb":"Labels are 10 digits numbers from 0 to 9. We need to encode these lables to one hot vectors (ex : 2 -> [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]).","9aef90eb":"## 3.2 Set the optimizer and annealer"}}
