To my surprise, LotArea is missing\n\nThere are also other significant variables that I missed during the earlier sneakpeak and that's the beauty of **EDA**. They are:   \n***GrLivArea*** (Living Area)   \n***GarageCars*** (no of cars the garage can hold and space)  \n***1stFlrSF*** (first floor square feet, Yes of course I love a vast first floor area)  \n**FullBath** (who doesn't love a big fat bath tub and bath space to drench themselves like a hippo!!!. Moreover, I would love a surround and an audio system - Its a personal choice though)  \nYearRemodAdd (Re-modelled year else if its a new property then the value is same as the Built year for that observation)","11deb58a":"## CORRELATIONS!!!","13bb9981":"well said!!!! Everyone like to work with data when it is clean and no painstaking efforts needed to clean and transform it. In any ML project, cleaning and transforming the data takes about 70 percent of the time. However, you need to know when to say no to certain things and when not to skip a process.","2f8b7a21":"### Some findings from the correlation heatmap are as follows:\n1. It is very obvious that diagonal points of a correlation matrix are highly correlated (1 always) as it is the same column it is correlating with\n2. GarageArea with GarageCars. (it is well known that no of cars that can be parked in th garage increase with the increase in space\n3. 1stFlrSF increases as TotalBsmtSF increases(seems very logical to me)  \n4.YearBuilt vs GarageArea\/GarageCars (0.48\/0.54) (*this seems interesting to think as things modernize,spending increases, lifestyle changes and transportation and convenience changes as each individual prefer having seperate cars for their convenience, thereby requiring more space in Garage.*)\n\nSome unusual correlations that seems like a causation to me rather than a correlation are:  \n.1.TotalRmsAbvGrd vs GrLivArea (0.83)  \n2.GrLivArea vs FullBath (0.63)  \n3.TotalRmsAbvGrd vs FullBath (0.55)\n\nThe best insight that I gained is yet to come.There is multicollinearity between the square feet varibles (TotalBsmtSF and 1stFlrSF) and between the (GarageCars and GarageArea). This greatly helps in ignoring features and better feature selection, because they do not add any new variance or non-linearity to our model. This is where you are able to see through things that can never be seen or understood that easily without an exploratory study.In addition to that, I strongly suggest you to go back to the correlation matrix above and check the second row that relates OverallQual with all other variables. A groundbreaking insight that's been playing hide and seek with us now brought to light. OverallQual has strong positive correlationship with all the other 9 variables out of top 10 variables that has high positive correlationship with SalePrice.\n\nFor instance, let's consider OverallQual vs price or investment to buy or build a property. The more you spend the better the product quality will be!!!!!\n","cc88e34c":"# DATA PREPARATION","603866e8":"Last but not the least, Inorder to proceed further in data cleaning and transformations, It is always of prime importance to check the distribution of all the numeric variables involved in the study, most importantly the target variable SalePrice.

Though I was a finance graduate and have a penchant towards investment and risk management, I dont really have as much interest in Real Estate as I do have in stock markets.

I came to a conclusion that if I am going to buy a property, I would definitely be interested in the following:\n\n* area of the property?\n\n* How old or new the property is?\n\n* Is it brand new or a renovated one?\n\n* Loaction of the property - City, Town, Sub-urbs or rural. (on a broader view, however, this can be broken down further)\n\nHence, just to have a quick sneakpeak, **I proceeded further to visualize the data in Tableau in order to see if that has any correlation with the SalePrice**.
