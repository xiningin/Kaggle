Although mouse-to-mouse transmission is relatively inefficient, they still observed a significant decrease in transmission efficiency with increasing relative humidity (RH) [23] and during summer months, even when laboratory temperature and RH were controlled during experiments [24]. Lowen et al. expanded upon these experiments in the guinea pig transmission model. At 20\u00b0C, transmission efficiency of an influenza A\/H3N2 isolate displayed a bimodal dependence on RH, with airborne (i.e., droplet or aerosol) transmission being maximal at 20\u201335% RH, poor at 50% RH, moderate at 65% RH, and absent at 80% RH. At 5\u00b0C, transmission was overall more efficient than at 20\u00b0C, and the relationship between RH and transmission efficiency was montonic, with efficiency decreasing with increasing RH [25]. Transmission was abolished at high temperature (30\u00b0C), regardless of RH [26].*","0666c2d6":"<font size=\"5\"> Summary <\/font>\n\n\nIn this analysis, primary goal is to find the factors that impact transmission rate of COVID-19. \nTo be very precise, i am trying to answer the below question:\n\n***What role does temperature and relative humidity play in the transmission of COVID-19 ?***\n\nAnd the answer is:\n\n**It plays a very significant role.
