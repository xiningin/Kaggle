In [this page](https:\/\/www.sea.gob.cl\/sea\/proyectos-actividades-sometidos-eia), we can see the general categories.","e04fb72f":"Apparently they are projects that do not have major particularities. Now, we can observe the duration per major typologies.","a858245e":"We see a high number of typologies used by SEA. Using the field \"typology_des\", we can identified the meaning of the most relevant typologies. ","1516e152":"We can note there are a large number of projects throughout the Chilean territory, specially in Metropolitan Region (in the center of the country). Clearly, there is a mistake in a row due to its location appears in Argentina. We can observe specific territories. For instance, it is know that a large number of projects related to the extraction and production of marine resources take place in the south of the country. ","429cfddb":"If we compare the state of evaluations by EIA and DIA, we can find a similar proportion of approval (\"Aprobado\"). A little part of evaluations are classified as denied (\"Rechazado\"). Besides, it is interesting that a great part of evaluation processes be withdrawn. Another appealing point is the value \"No Admitido a Tramitaci\u00f3n\" which means processes which do not meet the requirements imposed by SEA and the environmental normative. The \"expired\" status indicates that the permit was approved, but the project did not come to fruition within the stipulated period. This is relevant, since the environmental permit has a certain duration. After that period, the permit expires.","118ea5d8":"Now, is easier to identify the main typologies. If we review the [SEA page](https:\/\/www.sea.gob.cl\/sea\/proyectos-actividades-sometidos-eia), we can note the the main major typologies are:\n\n* n: Projects of intensive exploitation, cultivation, and hydrobiological resource processing plants\n* o: Environmental sanitation projects, such as sewage and drinking water systems, water or solid waste treatment plants of domestic origin, sanitary landfills, underwater outfalls, liquid or solid industrial waste treatment and disposal systems","a5d11906":"We cannot identy a clear trend between these features. Apparently, the investment do not imply the getting of a permit. On the other hand, we can observe thar in the first days, many evaluation processes are withdrawn or not admitted (\"No Admitido a Tramitaci\u00f3n\"). We only plot rows with processing_days less than 2000 in order to see clearer most points.","91380703":"We can observe 26953 projects.

If we review the main URL associated to each row, we can see some projects with thousand of documents, however the most are only observations. In this plot, we see rows with less than 5000 of documents. we can see a great heterogeneity in the data.","3c118301":"We observe that the most used evaluation type is DIA. This can be due to most project are not large or not imply high impacts. On the other hand, we need to consider that many projects have been segmented in little parts. In this way, is easier to obtain the environmental permission. In the rigth plot, we see that the amount of projects by DIA had an increase during 2005 and 2012. Now, the trend is down. In the last two years a sharp decrease is evidence, which may be associated with the **social crisis** that occurred in the country added to **COVID**.","9438da47":"Overall, the evaluation process of an EIA is around 364 days, while the average time for a DIA is 183 days. In the plots, we can observe that some evaluation processes escape of the average range. Even, there are some process with a duration of more than 5000 days. Maybe, we can identify these processes.","ec7bde07":"# Analysis of projects in Chile\n\nThe Environmental Assessment Service (or SEA as its name in Spanish) is the institution responsible for authorizing the operation of projects in Chile, which could have potential impacts in the population health or the environment. When a company wants to carry out a project of a relatively large magnitude, it should present a requirement to the SEA to evaluate the correct and safety operation of that project. In this way if a project is detectable as harmful to the environment or population, the service can deny the environmental permit and thereby the start-up of a project. From the starting point of SEA in 1997, more than 15 thousand of projects have been evaluated by this service, thereby the database of SEA contains a large number of registers, which can be useful to analyze. \n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/sea.gob.cl\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/noticia_portada\/public\/imagenes\/bloque-estilo-pagina-estatica\/sea_2d8d4.png?itok=ojZ7om3H\">\n\nNotice that projects can present a environmental impact statement (DIA in spanish) or a environmental impact study (EIA). This depend on the magnitude of potential impacts to the environment or health population. DIA means a simple evaluation of impacts, while EIA corresponds to a more complex assessment. With this information, several relevant questions can be answered using these data. \n\n* How long is the average time it takes a project to get the final response from the service?\n* What is the most important industry in Chile?\n* What are the regions with most number of projects?\n* Investment is correlated with the getting of permission?\n* What is the proportion of DIA and DIA?\n* EIA are most difficult to get permission?","0095d3ea":"In general terms, we cannot observe a clear distinction between the duration of days of different categories. Only we can identify a more sharp variation between EIA and DIA. Apart from that, some categories present a wider range of days, such as **n** and **u** categories."}}
