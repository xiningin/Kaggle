The following are some important links!\n\n- Competition Page: https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/lux-ai-2021\/\n\n- Online Visualizer: https:\/\/2021vis.lux-ai.org\/\n\n- Specifications: https:\/\/www.lux-ai.org\/specs-2021\n\n- Github: https:\/\/github.com\/Lux-AI-Challenge\/Lux-Design-2021\n\n- Bot API: https:\/\/github.com\/Lux-AI-Challenge\/Lux-Design-2021\/tree\/master\/kits\n\nAnd if you haven't done so already, we **highly recommend** you join our Discord server at https:\/\/discord.gg\/aWJt3UAcgn or at the minimum follow the kaggle forums at https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/lux-ai-2021\/discussion.
