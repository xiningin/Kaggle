You will need to set up a [Cloud platform project](https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/dataproc\/docs\/guides\/setup-project) and enable billing. The project ID will be used later in R to point to this project.\n\nTo access BigQuery using R, we will use the library \u201cbigquery\u201d created by Hadley Wickham. To install the library, run the following command in R:\n"}}
