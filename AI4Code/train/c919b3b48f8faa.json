The unit of measurement is **metric tons CO2e** (carbon dioxide equivalents) using GWP-100, AR5 values for all 4 GHGs measured\n* GHG emissions from the food system are identified from each **food system stage**. There are **8 stages of the global food system**, Land, Farm, Processing, Transport, Packaging, Retail, Consumer, Waste\n* There are 128700 rows and 7 columns in the EDGAR-FOOD dataset\n* Data source <a href = https:\/\/edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu\/edgar_food#data_download>link<\/a>","871ae4e5":"### Total food system GHG emissions have been growing\nFrom 1990 to 2015, total GHG emissions were in the range of **~16 to ~18 billion metric tons of CO2e**   \nLand emissions have declined while Farm emissions have grown, and annual trends for Land emissions mirror the rise and fall of carbon dioxide emissions ","6c03c6bb":"*Expand or condense any cells throughout this notebook to explore my code!*","8563b64c":"### Yearly trends in global food system emissions\nNow that we've seen food system emissions from 1990 to 2015 in total, let's take a look at trends over time.\nLet's take a look at food system emissions in total and then we'll look per stage and GHG.","a420cb07":"### Now that we see trends emerging for food products overall, we'll dive into differences among the same food products in different production systems and commodity types \n\nWe'll specifically focus on **Cattle and chicken** global GHG emissions from the U.N.
