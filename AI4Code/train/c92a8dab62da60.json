For example. if we want to see the index of the Pokemon with highest and lowest total stats, we should write:","7a641378":"We can also use mathematical operator as a filter condition, let's say we want to see Pokemon with more than 150 speed,","ba48e220":"So now we know that the Pokemon with the highest total stats has index number of 492, while the Pokemon with lowest total stats has index number of 190.\n\nThe `pandas.DataFrame.loc()` method allows us to select a group of rows and columns by label(s) or a boolean array. For example,  `pokedata.loc[[50]]` will return the 50th row of the dataframe.

One of the easiest way to select a subset of data in Pandas is using the `square bracket []`. For example, if we want to select the data between 10th and 15th row, then we should write:","ffb8dd31":"Now we can combine the `loc` and `idxmax` methods to find the Pokemon with highest and lowest Total stats"}}
