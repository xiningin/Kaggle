Let's collapse it a little bit & get a count of how frequently we see each bigram in our corpus. ","ebf66c1e":"### The order words are used in is important\n\nThe order that words are used in text is not random. In English, for example, you can say \"the red apple\" but not \"apple red the\". The relationships between words in text is very complex. So complex, in fact, that there's an entire field of linguistics devoted to it: syntax. (You can learn more about syntax [here](https:\/\/pdfs.semanticscholar.org\/ba33\/a9656f43a6b7420a180bdeccd5be98fc05eb.pdf), if you're interested.)\n\nHowever, there is a relatively simply way of capturing some of these relationships between words, originally proposed by Warren Weaver. You can capture quite a bit of information by just looking at which words tend to show up next to each other more often. \n\n\n### What are ngrams? \n\nThe general idea is that you can look at each pair (or triple, set of four, etc.) of words that occur next to each other. In a sufficently-large corpus, you're likely to see \"the red\" and \"red apple\" several times, but less likely to see \"apple red\" and \"red the\". This is useful to know if, for example, you're trying to figure out what someone is more likely to say to help decide between possible output for an automatic speech recognition system.\n\nThese co-occuring words are known as \"n-grams\", where \"n\" is a number saying how long a string of words you considered. (Unigrams are single words, bigrams are two words, trigrams are three words, 4-grams are four words, 5-grams are five words, etc.)\n\n\n> **Learning goal:** In this tutorial, you'll learn how to find all the n-grams in a corpus & count how often each is used.","4eba318e":"I'm not a fluent Spanish speaker, but those do look like some reasonable very frequent two-word phrases in Spanish.\n\nAnd that's all there is to it! Here are some exercises to help you try it out yourself.\n\n\n### Your turn!\n\n1. Find the most frequent n-grams in another file in this corpus. You can find the other files by entering \"..\/input\/spanish_corpus\/\" in a code chunk and then hitting the Tab key. All of the files will be listed in a drop-down menu. Are the most frequent bigrams the same as they were in this file?\n2. Instead of bigrams (two word phrases), can you find trigrams (three words)?\n3. Find the most frequent ngrams in another corpus. You can find some [here](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/datasets?sortBy=relevance&group=featured&search=corpus) to start you out.","d78120c2":"Ok, now onto making the n-grams! The first thing we want to do is \"tokenize\", or break the  text into indvidual words (you can find more information on tokenization [here](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/rtatman\/tokenization-tutorial))."}}
