At a first glance, we will predict this for October 2015 in order to find the best model possible. We have to create our Dataset. Firstly, we need to compute the sum for each month for each product and shop. We need to be careful and to compute, therefore, the mean of the item price for each month. Also, we have to clip the value between 0 and 20 because the true target values are between those values (constraint from the competition rules). In order to create a model based on the results of the prediction of October 2015, I choose to add for each month the couple (shop_id, item_id) if it does not exist. Moreover, I have to fill the columns \"item_name\" and \"item_price\". For \"item_name\", I will use Label Encoder because there is to many items and OneHotEncoder is too heavy for my computer in this case. For \"item_price\", I will use SimpleImputer (mean) and adding a column describing that we have filled the NaN values.**"}}
