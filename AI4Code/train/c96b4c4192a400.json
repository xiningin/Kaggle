A key advantage of the collaborative filtering approach is that it does not rely on machine analyzable content and therefore it is capable of accurately recommending complex items such as movies without requiring an \"understanding\" of the item itself. Collaborative filtering is based on the assumption that people who agreed in the past will agree in the future, and that they will like similar kinds of items as they liked in the past.\n* Content-based filtering\nmethods are based on a description of the item and a profile of the user\u2019s preferences.\nIn a content-based recommender system, keywords are used to describe the items and a user profile is built to indicate the type of item this user likes. In other words, these algorithms try to recommend items that are similar to those that a user liked in the past (or is examining in the present). In particular, various candidate items are compared with items previously rated by the user and the best-matching items are recommended.\n* Hybrid recommender systems\nwhich is combining collaborative filtering and content-based filtering could be more effective in some cases. Hybrid approaches can be implemented in several ways: by making content-based and collaborative-based predictions separately and then combining them; by adding content-based capabilities to a collaborative-based approach (and vice versa); or by unifying the approaches into one mode. ","0028489a":"Finally, let's move to PySpark. \nThere is 2 ways to install it in Kaggle Kernels: \n* Run magic command, as in cell below\n* Or go to Packages and enter pyspark (it will take some time, but this will form your own version of docker and you'll no need to waste time while running next versions of kernel)","a36e049f":"We see that most movies are watched till the end.","94ad1a04":"# PySpark implementation","b2721f2e":"# Dataset","cc32a68c":"In my case I would like to recommend movies to users, based on dataset provided by [Megogo](https:\/\/megogo.net\/ru) and competition they hosted at [Kaggle](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/megogochallenge). \n\nI've been participated in this competiton during mlcourse and took 10th place out of 42 teams there. ","c93a2ee8":"Wow! Our RMSE improved really well!\nBut remember, if the rating matrix is derived from another source of information (i.e. it is inferred from other signals), you can set `implicitPrefs` to `True` to get better results. \n\nCould we do more? \nLet me increase `rank`, which is number of latent factor a bit. ","3c48cc41":"In summary, collaborative filtering is one of the most popular approach to build recommendation system. \nMovie recommendation task become extremely popular after [Netflix competition](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Netflix_Prize) with one million dollar prize, which push Machine Learning a lot in recommender systems field. \n\nWith PySpark, we could get great results in this task just in a few lines of code. \nIn production, new problems appeared, on of them is **cold start** problem when we have no any historical information about user, but still have to recommend something.\nBut that's more than this tutorial would like to cover.\n\nHope this small intro was useful, feel free to criticize, discuss, and maybe upvote:) ","0679f973":"Great!
