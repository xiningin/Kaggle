Time since last event\n\nThis is often difficult to do with most table manipulation frameworks, since they are designed to work with relationships across columns. As such, we've created a class to handle this type of data.\n\nWe'll define a function `get_elapsed` for cumulative counting across a sorted dataframe. Given a particular field `fld` to monitor, this function will start tracking time since the last occurrence of that field. When the field is seen again, the counter is set to zero.\n\nUpon initialization, this will result in datetime na's until the field is encountered. This is reset every time a new store is seen. We'll see how to use this shortly.","ff7294a3":"Same process for Promo dates.","73ca974f":"In time series data, cross-validation is not random. Instead, our holdout data is generally the most recent data, as it would be in real application. This issue is discussed in detail in [this post](http:\/\/www.fast.ai\/2017\/11\/13\/validation-sets\/) on our web site.\n\nOne approach is to take the last 25% of rows (sorted by date) as our validation set.","c17bf10f":"## Create features","bc1685cb":"Let's walk through an example.\n\nSay we're looking at School Holiday.

By default, we'll be doing a left outer join of `right` on the `left` argument using the given fields for each table.\n\nPandas does joins using the `merge` method. The `suffixes` argument describes the naming convention for duplicate fields. We've elected to leave the duplicate field names on the left untouched, and append a \"\\_y\" to those on the right.","8c5af055":"Now we'll merge these values onto the df.","f915fee2":"We'll do this for two more fields.","77e41f90":"To run on the full dataset, use this instead:","f52f5e1f":"Some categorical variables have a lot more levels than others.

We speculate that this may have cost them a higher standing in the competition. One reason this may be the case is that a little exploratory data analysis reveals that there are often periods where stores are closed, typically for refurbishment. Before and after these periods, there are naturally spikes in sales that one might expect. By ommitting this data from their training, the authors gave up the ability to leverage information about these periods to predict this otherwise volatile behavior.","42157e08":"It's usually a good idea to back up large tables of extracted \/ wrangled features before you join them onto another one, that way you can go back to it easily if you need to make changes to it.","58057df7":"Now we can outer join all of our data into a single dataframe. Recall that in outer joins everytime a value in the joining field on the left table does not have a corresponding value on the right table, the corresponding row in the new table has Null values for all right table fields. One way to check that all records are consistent and complete is to check for Null values post-join, as we do here.\n\n*Aside*: Why note just do an inner join?\nIf you are assuming that all records are complete and match on the field you desire, an inner join will do the same thing as an outer join. However, in the event you are wrong or a mistake is made, an outer join followed by a null-check will catch it. (Comparing before\/after # of rows for inner join is equivalent, but requires keeping track of before\/after row #'s. Outer join is easier.)","289591ce":"Next we'll extract features \"CompetitionOpenSince\" and \"CompetitionDaysOpen\".

This is a good opportunity to highlight pandas indexing. We can use `.loc[rows, cols]` to select a list of rows and a list of columns from the dataframe.
