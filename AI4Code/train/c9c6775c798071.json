Due to its technological impact, its open-source code and the possibility of installing applications from third parties without any central control, Android has recently become a malware target. Even if it includes security mechanisms, the last news about malicious activities and Android\u00b4s vulnerabilities point to the importance of continuing the development of methods and frameworks to improve its security.\n\nTo prevent malware attacks, researches and developers have proposed different security solutions, applying static analysis, dynamic analysis, and artificial intelligence. Indeed, data science has become a promising area in cybersecurity, since analytical models based on data allow for the discovery of insights that can help to predict malicious activities.\n\nWe can analyze cyber threats using two techniques, static analysis, and dynamic analysis, the most important thing is that these are the approaches to get the features that we are going to use in data science.\n\n+ **Static analysis**: it includes the methods that allow us to get information about the software that we want to analyze without executing it, one example of them is the study of the code, their callings, resources, etc.\n+ **Dynamic analysis**: it is another approach where the idea is to analyze the cyber threat during its execution, in other words, get information about its behavior, some of their features are the netflows.\n","813bdabc":"From [6] we concluded that the best network features are:\n\n+ (R1): TCP packets, it has the number of packets TCP sent and got during communication.\n+ (R2): Different TCP packets, it is the total number of packets different from TCP.\n+ (R3): External IP, represents the number the external addresses (IPs) where the application tried to communicated\n+ (R4): Volume of bytes, it is the number of bytes that was sent from the application to the external sites\n+ (R5) UDP packets, the total number of packets UDP transmitted in a communication.\n+ (R6) Packets of the source application, it is the number of packets that were sent from the application to a remote server.\n+ (R7) Remote application packages, number of packages received from external sources.\n+ (R8) Bytes of the application source, this is the volume (in Bytes) of the communication between the application and server.\n+ (R9) Bytes of the application remote, this is the volume (in Bytes) of the data from the server to the emulator.\n+ (R10) DNS queries, number of DNS queries.\n","38d31211":"# Conclusions","6ffdef0a":"Type is the label that represents if an application is a malware or not, as we can see this dataset is balanced.","3d92baf9":"**Great \ud83d\udcaa\ud83e\udd16!!**, now we have seen the two approaches to analyze a cyber threat.
