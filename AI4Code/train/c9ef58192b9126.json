I found it challenging and refreshing.","947f4a25":"As seen in the **Graph 1**, it appears that norwegian children have their language explosion in a similar manner than english speaking children. It's interesting as well to find the interquartile range of 23-28 however, but this only represent the age at which they learn the mayority of words. Not the speed of acquisition.","b4fc5521":"## References and Future Work\n\nKnowledge of the normal pattern of child development is fundamental both to our understanding of the human person as well as making interventions when atypical patterns are observed. Its important to keep studying normal child development. Studies such as that of Hansen P need to be replicated in other populations as this information is not available for most areas of the world.\n\nIt'd be interesting to follow other developmental trayectories for example phonological development of children in similar datasets.\n\nReferences:\n\n- Hansen P.
