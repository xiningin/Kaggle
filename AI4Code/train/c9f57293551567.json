Consider the model `target = weight * lag_1 + error`, where `error` is random noise and `weight` is a number between -1 and 1. The `weight` in this case tells you how likely the next time step will have the same sign as the previous time step: a `weight` close to 1 means `target` will likely have the same sign as the previous step, while a `weight` close to -1 means `target` will likely have the opposite sign.\n\n# 2) Interpret linear regression with a lag feature\n\nRun the following cell to see two series generated according to the model just described."}}
