analysis\n\n## Whats the age distribution on each group?","f8406f1e":"It seems to be no missing values, which is perfect! we'll go ahead and get familiarized with the dataset\n\n# 1. Exploratory data analysis\nThis section aims to explorate the data a bit, try to get a feel of the problem and maybe find some key insights that might be useful later on\n\nFirst of all, lets let's just see the number of people who left and who didn't","85cf82ca":"Okay so there's a lot of stuff here (maybe too much, ups) but lets break it down:\n\n1. We can see that leavers are in the younger age group (as we saw before) but we actually see that they tend to have lower sallaries then persons who stayed in the company\n\n2. As a person gets older they tend to get a higher monthly income (probably because their tenure in the company increases as well)\n\n3. It appears that receiving a salary hike above the average has no effect on making a person stay in the company since the're so many leavers with above average salary hikes\n\n4. This effect might only be noticeable for persons with higher monthly incomes (above 10000) but more investigation would be needed to say the for certain\n\nlastly let's just see the overall correlation between the variables","23031bb7":"This plot shows us that as the Age of the employee and his\/hers income increases, the probability of the employee leaving decreases (Age seems to increase the probability of an employee leaving after a certain high age).\n\n## And what about other variables such as TotalWorkingYears and YearsInCurrentRole?\n\nWe can apply the same technique for these variables to answer this question","db07e83c":"Our model is still far from production ready as it still has a some-what low precision, but if this company were to effectively retain all the true positives we identified in the test set (Which would be impossible because they we wouldn't know which ones where true-positives or false-positives, but regardless) the company could have saved **$415 614.108**! That's a good number to put in any results presentation you should to your management team :)!\n\n# What makes the employees leave?\n\nIt's good to be able to save the company money by predicting who's going to leave and who's not, but the ideal situation is to inform the company what's the most critical features that make our model think that a person is going to leave.\n\nTo do that we'll dive a bit into machine learning explainability. We'll do this in three steps:\n\n* Find out what are the features that the model payed close attetion to, using permutation feature importance\n\n* From certain features let's check how is the model affect as they vary, using partial dependence plots\n\n* Let's look at some people and see how did their features contribute to the decision of the model, using local permutation feature importance\n\n## What are the most relevant features for our model?\n\nTo find this out we're going to be using permutation feature importance. This tecnhique is used after the model is trained and the idea is that we ask: **if I randomly shuffle a column of my validation data, how would that affect the accuracy of my model?**","54789181":"This heatmap says alot about the company:\n\n1. Higher lob levels means higher monthly incomes (which is obvious)\n\n2. Theres a strong correlation between the number of years at the company and the number of years with a given manager and role, meaning that people in this company don't often change managers\/roles\n\n3. People with higher performance ratings receive higher salary hikes (which is also obvious) but when we contrast this with the previous plot where we say there where a lot of leavers with above average salary hikes, we get the sense that many of our leavers are have a good performance, which aggravates the cost of employee attrition\n\nLets move on to a different analysis other than visualizations and let's which variables have a greater impact in our outcome variable through means of feature selection\n\n# 2. Feature Selection\n\nWe'll be using a univariate filter. What this means is that for every variable we'll do a univariate statistical test and determine wether the variable is relevant to predict leaving employees or not. First we'll one-hot encode the necessary features and scale everything\n\nSome features don't need to be one-hot encoded as they have a sense of order to them (like Education or  PerformanceRating) so we wount one-hot encode these features","4db625a5":"The results are:\n\n* Overtime seems to be the most key factor for determining if a employee is likely to leave or not\n* A person being single comes next\n* Then comes the Age of the person followed by the number of years with their current manager as well as how much they're paid\n\nSo we can kind of have a feel of the type of person that leaves. Probably a young, single person who puts in alot of overtime, they may leave because they're the most attractive persons for other companies to employ them, or it might be because they're feeling unappreciated.\n\n## But how does the effect of age\/income evolve as these variables increase?\n\nIt's an interesting thing to find out. Do people tend to not leave as much as they get older? Do they stay if they have higher salaries?\nTo find this out we'll use partial dependence plots, which basically plot how the predicted probability changes as we increase a certain variable","7faa6b6f":"So there's a near 50-50 split in people who leave the company reagarding overtime, meaning some work overtime and some don't.\n\nBut the finding we can take from here is that just a small portion (around 27%) of people who stay in the company work overtime. Meaning this might be another usefull feature for our model, if an observation states that a person works overtime we'll be more inclined to say that this person is likely to leave the company (so go ahead and tell your bosses you're not working overtime because you don't want to leave the company (: )\n\nThere's many more plots we could make to answer some basic questions like these ones, but these visualizations are only one-dimensional (for each attrition group) so, although they're helpful, we might get some extra information when we see the relation between two or more variables\n\n## Age vs monthly income with salary hike controling the size\n\nThis is a good company to be in since everyone got a increase in it's salary, but some received more than others, let's look at what's the relation between the age and the monthly income and let's make the points bigger where a person received a salary hike above the average (which is around 15%)","7c62e897":"This gives us alot of information about the prediction on this particular employee.\n\nwe see that the model gave him a 19% chance of leaving, and more importantly we can see which factors contribute the most for this decision.\n\n- This particular employee has not worked overtime so this is a strong contradiction to the claim that the employee will leave the company\n- This employee does not work as a Sales Representative so this is also a contradicting argument to the claim that the employee will leave\n- He\/She is single, is young and has a farely poor income with no stock options, and this makes the employee more likely to leave\n\nWe can do this process for every employee we want and have a better understanding of the feature importance vary from employee to employee.\n\nI hope this helps you implement a similar concept in your company in order to save money, and especially, make everyone happier!\n\nCheers!","c120d772":"# 4. Interpreting the results\n\nA [2012 study by the Center of American Progress](https:\/\/www.americanprogress.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/11\/CostofTurnover.pdf) found that the median cost of replacing an employee was 21.4% of his\/hers annual salary, we'll be using this value to calculate the cost we could have reducted if we had retained the employees we predicted of leaving in the test set\n\nThe study actually segmentates the cost percentage by how much an employee receives annualy but for the porpuse of this analysis the median is a good value to use","c3e9a1c2":"This company has more men the women and so this plot shows us that men tend to leave the company more but only because they're in a larger number.

Granted not all attritions are bad, some employees are just disrupting, but in general maintining the maximum number of employees as possible is a sound strategy, as described [here](https:\/\/inventiv.io\/what-is-the-cost-of-replacing-an-employee\/), [here](https:\/\/www.employeeconnect.com\/blog\/flight-risk-signals-what-makes-employees-leave\/) and [here](http:\/\/analytics-magazine.org\/predictive-analytics-the-privacy-pickle-hewlett-packards-prediction-of-employee-behavior\/)\n\nWith this context in mind we'll try to create a model to predict who's about to leave the company so we could report it to HR and they can decid to do something about it\n\n# Table Of Contents\n 1.

Of course this only of the top of my head but at least we have an ANOVA test to back our findings :)\n\nSince we don't have many observations in our dataset, having too many features like we do might prove the learning process dificult, and so selecting features this way may be beneficial!\n\n# 3.

To do this we need **local feature importance** and one way to do this is with [LIME (Local Importance Model-Agnostic Explanations)](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/pdf\/1602.04938)\n\nThe main idea behind LIME is that every complex model is linear at a local level. Therefore we can create a surrogate model that is more interpretable than our model, and draw our conclusions from it.\n\n**Note:** It's very important that this analysis is done with caution, we might be tempted to change our features based on some examples we analyse but this might be a bad decision","872c60a6":"It appears to be so. Around 27% of people who left the company felt really dissatisfied with their jobs, while only nearly 17% of people who stayed said the same thing.\n\nIn contrast people who stay in the company seem to be, in general, satisfied with their jobs.\n\nIt's also interesting to see there's a large portion of leavers that have a level 3 of satisfaction. This might be either because of the scoring mechanism (i.e, 3 is a somewhat neutral job statisfaction level) or they're cases where a person does not leave the job because they don't like it but maybe they received a better offer\n\n## Do people who leave tend to have more overtime?"}}
