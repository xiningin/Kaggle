To do that, while they acquire new customers, they also want to make sure that the existing ones stay with them for a long term. Also, its strategically important to know beforehand whether a set of customers are planning to stop using their services (especially recurring ones like internet, cable, phone etc.). To do that, every company or business creates and tracks customer metrics which are then used to predict their likelihood of churn.\n\nCustomer Churn for a company occurs when a customer decides to stop using the services of that company. In this project, we will be using the customer data of a telecom sector company based in the US to predict the probability of churn for each of the customer.
