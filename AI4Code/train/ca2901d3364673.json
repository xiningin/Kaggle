Nevertheless, it does not come close to automating EDA. The actual, individualized work will still have to be completed manually.\n\n\n### If these kernels impress you,give them an <font size=\"+2\" color=\"red\"><b>Upvote<\/b><\/font>.<br>","a92986d7":"## <font color='blue'>EDA with Pandas Profiling  <\/font>\n### <font color='blue'>EDA of training set  <\/font>","49de990e":"#### <font color='purple'>1.

Besides, if this is not enough to convince us to use this tool, it also generates interactive reports in web format that can be presented to any person, even if they don\u2019t know programming.\n\n\n#### In short, what pandas profiling does is save us all the work of visualizing and understanding the distribution of each variable. It generates a report with all the information easily available.\n\n\n#### I chose to apply pandas-profiling to the Titanic data set due to the data\u2019s variety in type as well as its missing values. In my opinion, pandas-profiling is particularly interesting when the data is not cleaned yet and still requires further individualized adjustments. To better guide your focus during these individualized adjustments, you need to know where to start and what to focus on. This is where pandas-profiling comes in.\n","e202c21c":"## <font color='blue'>How to use pandas profiling <\/font>\n\n\n\n#### First step is to install it with this command:\n\n### pip install pandas-profiling\n\n\n#### Then we generate the report using these commands:\n","81a2ddd4":"<a href=\"#top\" class=\"btn btn-success btn-lg active\" role=\"button\" aria-pressed=\"true\" style=\"color:white\" data-toggle=\"popover\" title=\"go to Colors\">Go to TOP<\/a>","cbaac1d7":"## <font color='blue'>Pandas profiling disadvantage  <\/font>\nThe main disadvantage of pandas profiling is its use with large datasets. With the increase in the size of the data the time to generate the report also increases a lot.\n\n\nOne way to solve this problem is to generate the report from only a part of all the data we have. It is important to make sure that the data selected to generate the report is representative of all the data we have, for example it could be the case that the first X rows of data contain only data from one category. In this example we would like to randomize the order of the data and select a representative sample.","c8fcbc97":"<font size=\"+3\" color=\"blue\"><b>Table of Content<\/b><\/font><br><a id=\"top\"><\/a>"}}
