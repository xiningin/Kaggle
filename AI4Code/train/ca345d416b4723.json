(If you're just looking for the dataset created with this notebook, you can [find it here](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/jhoward\/rsna-hemorrhage-jpg).)\n\nAfter cleaning up the data and create a prototyping dataset, we will use it to train and submit a model. You can see the followup notebook that uses this data here: [From Prototyping To Submission](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/jhoward\/from-prototyping-to-submission-fastai)\n\nHere are the issues that we will address.\n\n1. Fix images with incorrect RescaleIntercept\n1. Remove some images if they have little useful information (e.g. they don't actually contain brain tissue)\n1.

In addition, in [this comment](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/jhoward\/some-dicom-gotchas-to-be-aware-of-fastai\/comments#646349) Malcolm McLean pointed out that the values in these images seem wrong.
