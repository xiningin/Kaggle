The sizes of most competitive bid and ask orders were always balanced until the very end. Couple changes at the end caused a small decrease and increase in weighted average price 1. That was the only significant contribution to current realized volatility. This time bucket became almost 20 times less volatile in next 10 minute window.","e28ba6c7":"## 3. Realized Volatility (Target)\n\nTarget is defined as realized volatility computed over the 10 minute window following the feature data under the same stock\/time_id. For every stock_id and its time_id, target is the next 10 minute realized volatility of the same stock_id and time_id. Thus, there are 10 minute gaps between provided dataset and target values, and there is no overlap between them.\n\nRealized volatility, $\\sigma$, is the squared root of the sum of squared log returns which is denoted as\n\n$\\huge \\sigma = \\sqrt{\\sum_{t}r_{t-1, t}^2}$\n\nand log return of a stock $S$ at time $t$ is\n\n$\\huge r_{t-1, t} = \\log \\left( \\frac{S_{t-1}}{S_{t1}} \\right)$\n\nwhere $S_t$ is the prize of the stock $S$ at time $t$. The price used for targets is the weighted averaged price (WAP) and it can be derived from book data. Log returns are used for realized volatility calculation because price differences are not always comparable across stocks.","17b51889":"## 5. Trade\n\nTrade data represents the aggregation of all individual executed orders for corresponding stocks and time buckets. Size is the sum of the size in each individual order, price is aggregated as a weighted averaged price of all trades and order count is the number of unique trade orders taking place. For trade data, missing seconds_in_bucket implies no trade happening within that one second window.\n\nTrade data files are named as `trade_train.parquet` and `trade_test.parquet`, and they are parquet files partitioned by stock_id column. Partitioned by stock_id means those files can both read as whole or individual stocks. However, reading them as a single file is not easy as they will consume too much memory.\n\nThere are 5 columns in every trade data partition. The columns are:\n\n* `time_id` - ID of the time bucket\n* `seconds_in_bucket` - Number of seconds passed since the start of the bucket\n* `price` - Weighted average price of all executed trades happening in one second\n* `size` - Total number of traded shares happening in one second\n* `order_count` - Number of unique trade orders happening in one second\n\nTrade data has lots of missing seconds_in_bucket as it is more sparse than order book. Besides, there are some missing time buckets in trade data which means there weren't any trades in that 10 minute window. In addition to that, seconds_in_bucket doesn't necessarily start from 0 in trade data. Trade data can be still reshaped into a fixed size by adding missing time buckets and reindexing time steps to 600 seconds. Missing values can be filled with zeros afterwards since there weren't any trades at those one second windows.","55408e19":"Trade data tells how many shares are traded at what weighted averaged price by how many unique traders for every time step. Those traded shares are the ones listed in the order book at the corresponding time step. Oscillations of trade price, size and order count might be an indicator of realized volatility of the next 10 minute window. Another important thing to consider is sparsity. Sparsity indicates that the stock is calm and there aren't any trades taking place which could be a strong indicator of low realized volatility. However, it may not be a predictor of the next 10 minute windows' realized volatility. The function in the cell below is going to be used for visualizing individual trade data time buckets and trying to find clues about their volatilities. It is important to visualize every sequence with and without zeros in order to understand both oscillations and sparsity.","251263cb":"The order book helps traders to make more informed trading decisions by showing order imbalances that may provide clues to a stock\u2019s direction in the very short term.

Traders can also use the order book to help pinpoint a stock\u2019s potential support and resistance levels. A cluster of large buy orders at a specific price may indicate a level of support, while an abundance of sell orders at or near one price may suggest an area of resistance.\nRealized volatilities increase when those moves in either directions become more frequent.

The time bucket was extremely volatile in current 10 minute window and it became the most volatile time bucket in next 10 minute window. Short-term realized volatilities are definitely correlated in this case. First of all, this time bucket is on a decreasing trend because large amount of most competitive ask sizes are always dominating most competitive bid sizes. Some traders were trying to sell lots of shares at most competitive price very frequently. In addition to that, this time bucket has more updates compared to others. Update frequency of time buckets might be correlated to realized volatility since more squared log return values greater than 0 will be summed.","7428563d":"## 2. Evaluation\n\nSubmissions are scored using RMSPE (root mean squared percentage error) which can be denoted as\n\n$\\huge \\text{RMSPE} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} ((y_i - \\hat{y}_i)\/y_i)^2}$\n\nRMSPE is very similar to RMSE. The only difference between them is, the error is divided by the actual value. Predictions closer to actual values yield errors closer to 0, so division by actual values is sensitive to larger errors. In addition to that, errors are squared before they are averaged, which makes this metric even more sensitive to larger errors. This means larger errors are not tolerable in this domain.\n\nOne pitfall of RMSPE is it can raise ZeroDivisionError if a single data point in actual values is equal to 0. Even though, there isn't any 0 target values in training set, this can be easily solved by adding a small constant to actual values. A small constant epsilon wouldn't contribute to overall rmspe and it prevents ZeroDivisionError.\n\nFor baselines, global target mean scores **1.11033**, target mean of stock_ids scores **0.789618**, and target median of stock_ids scores **0.589135**  on training set.","f768c4a9":"As expected, the most correlated features with target are realized volatilities of WAP1, WAP2 and bid_ask_price_ratio.

Prices and sizes of most competitive bid and ask orders are exteremely balanced in this entire time bucket. Sizes of most competitive bid level is shifted to a new state at the second half. That movement slightly increased the weighted averaged price 1, and that was the only thing contributed to current realized volatility. Stock 31 is very calm compared to other stocks.

Other than those two, there aren't any obvious patterns that can be seen over the clusters. ","dee02e3a":"## 4. Order Book\n\nOrder book is a list of buy and sell orders organized by price level for given stocks. An order book lists the number of shares being bid on or asked at each price point. Order books help to improve market transparency as they provide information on price, availability and depth of trade.\n\nOrder book data files are named as `book_train.parquet` and `book_test.parquet`, and they are parquet files partitioned by stock_id column. Partitioned by stock_id means those files can both read as whole or individual stocks. However, reading them as a single file is not easy as they will consume too much memory.\n\nThere are 10 columns in every book data partition. The columns are:\n\n* `time_id` - ID of the time bucket\n* `seconds_in_bucket` - Number of seconds passed since the start of the bucket\n* `bid_price1` - Highest buy price after normalization\n* `ask_price1` - Lowest sell price after normalization\n* `bid_price2` - Second highest buy price after normalization\n* `ask_price2` - Second lowest sell price after normalization\n* `bid_size1` - Number of shares on the highest buy price\n* `ask_size1` - Number of shares on the lowest sell price\n* `bid_size2` - Number of shares on the second highest buy price\n* `ask_size2` - Number of shares on the second lowest sell price\n\nValues in order book are the last snapshots of each second. Some of the seconds are not available because there weren't any related market activities during those seconds, thus order books are not updated. Normally, given order books last 600 seconds for every time bucket. Values of the missing seconds are the values at the last updated second, so the book data can be reindexed to 600 seconds for every time bucket and missing values can be forward filled for every field. Forward filling and sorting order books by time_id and seconds_in_bucket doesn't change the extracted features but these functionalities can be added for private test set as a sanity check.","a9b5f2aa":"Aggregations on bid_ask_price_ratio are either extremely left or right skewed because lots of values are clustered around 0 or 1. However, there is a slight relationship between target and bid_ask_price_ratio aggregations.

Standard deviation of raw sequences and weighted averaged prices would be useful because it tells the amount of variation. Finally, distributions of WAP1 and WAP2 realized volatilities are very similar to distribution of target which suggests that they are correlated with next 10 minute window realized volatility.","e18d78dd":"Distribution of target is highly right-skewed and there are extreme outliers since some of the stocks are very volatile.

Stocks\n\nAs mentioned in the introduction, there are 112 stocks across different sectors and their ids are between 0 and 126. Those stocks are different from each other in many aspects but they are clustered based on their realized volatilities in this section. Even though the stocks are independent from each other, cross-stock relationship features might be useful for the models. Besides, deep learning models can also learn distances between two stocks in n-dimensional space which could also be a useful information.","8a362d3e":"Each stock is very different in terms of volatility. Stocks are displayed below from most volatile to least volatile. They are ranked by their mean target value across multiple time_ids.

This phenomenon can be explained by time_ids not being sequential, and there aren't any temporal dependencies between them.","abb66137":"## 6. Feature Engineering\n\nFeature engineering is very important in this competition because it won't be easy to use neural networks directly on time buckets. Previously, realized volatilities of current 10 minute window were extracted from WAP1 and WAP2, but the same aggregation can be applied to any sequence since it tells the total amount of movement happened in it. Other simple aggregations like mean, standard deviation, min and max can also be used for feature engineering.\n\nA very simple feature bid_ask_price_ratio is created while iterating over order books. Multiple aggregations on that simple feature might yield valuable information about realized volatility of the next 10 minute window. Aggregations on simple features like that or aggregations on raw sequences is the most straightforward way of feature engineering. Before moving forward to advanced features, simple feature aggregations should be fully explored.","f1c98a36":"As mentioned, realized volatilities are calculated from the weighted averaged price in order books of every stock.

Trade price without zeros is almost perfectly correlated with weighted averaged price from the order book and trade price with zeros shows that there are trades taking place very frequently. Size shows that there are some extreme amounts of shares traded at certain times by one or multiple traders. Finally, order count shows that there are large number of unique trade orders from time to time regardless of the total size and price.","24f88655":"The least volatile 10 time buckets are also visualized and they can be seen below.

Introduction\n\nThis competition's objective is predicting short-term volatility for 112 stocks across different sectors. Dataset consist book and trade data of the stocks for multiple time buckets.

Thus, there are 428,932 rows to predict in it. Since this is a code competition, public test set is hidden and private test set will be real market data collected in the three-month evaluation period after competition ends. There are 3 columns in training set and 2 columns in placeholder test set.\n\n* `stock_id` - ID of the stock\n* `time_id` - ID of the time bucket\n* `target` - Realized volatility of the next 10 minute window under the same stock_id\/time_id (doesn't exist in placeholder test set)","c748234e":"Realized volatilies derived from trade price are used as baseline predictions.

Realized volatility of the next 10 minute window for this time bucket is 0.039 which is roughly greater than %99.994 of other target values. In this case, this time bucket became less volatile in next 10 minute window and that suggests it is really hard to tell whether the realized volatility will be more or less in short-term, but it is expected to be closer to current realized volatility. This stock was extremely volatile in this time bucket because large amount of sell orders at most competitive prize dominated buy orders in first quarter and the opposite happened in second quarter.
