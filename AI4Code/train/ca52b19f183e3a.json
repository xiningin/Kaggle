The key is to select only rows that link main dataframe on SK_ID_CURR column.","79883f09":"# Modeling\n\nJust to see if this tool added some benefit, we'll run already introduced feature selection and see if we improved the score of benchmark model.","c42683f8":"## Reduce number of features\n\nThe idea here is to fit simple model with in-built feature importances (Random Forest) and drop all columns that have lower significance than random columns added in preparation step.","1856d9e4":"# Conclusion\n\nAdded features didn't seem to improve the score pre and post selection by importance. This of course does not mean that the tool is useless, because most of the time feature engineering is just adding the same basic primitives and transforms - counts, sums, means, etc. Remember, we have not considered all tables available in the data, perhaps they contain more signal. Also, featuretools were run with default presets, which could be tinkered with, so definitely looks like something to add in the toolset, to inrease productivity, especially when building PoCs.","b2a9ead8":"## Create entity set\n\nFirst we need to create entity set - list all dataframes and their ids. We'll create an index for bureau balance data because it doesn't have one and it is required by featuretools.\nThere's an inbuilt plotting function to check entity set before proceeding.","795138a1":"## Create relationships\n\nOnce we have our entity set, we need to establish relationships between entities (tables\/dataframes).  As it was shown (see diagram in the beginning of the notebook) application data is the main table, which links to bureau data via `SK_ID_CURR` column. Each `SK_ID_CURR` can have multiple records in bureau table, which has `SK_ID_BUREAU` unique identifier that subsequently links to records in bureau_balance table.","fbb59f75":"## Preprocessing","eb4940b4":"![image](https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/kaggle-media\/competitions\/home-credit\/home_credit.png)","43a892ec":"## Application data","2e5464ab":"Application data is of considerable size both in terms of rows and columns, has mixed data types, some missing values and inbalanced target classes.  \nSince automated feature generation is quite resource intensive process, we need to downsample, preprocess and reduce dimensionality before creating more features.","3601d168":"## Bureau balance data","100b8505":"## Create features\n\nAutomating feature creation is as simple as calling a on-liner with established entity set and pointing to a dataframe, where features should be added. Depending on data size, entity set complexity, chosen primitives, transforms and depth (see more on https:\/\/featuretools.alteryx.com\/en\/stable\/getting_started\/afe.html) this might take a while to run.","ef964471":"Since this table has higher granularity, we cannot perform feature reduction in the same way like we did with application data and it has just 17 columns anyway, also there's no need to add random features when processing.","c9523b0d":"# Feature engineering\n\nOk, now that data is ready, let's see what featuretools have to offer.","81ebdb78":"## Balance target classes","a58fc4fb":"Featuretools created more than 200 features out of our entity set with default primitive and transform configurations, of course not all of them make sense or add signal, so we have to perform selection again.","782a8534":"Neat!
