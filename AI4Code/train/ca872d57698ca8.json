You'll also specify a logical order for the categories, which will be useful for future exercises.","0150bb70":"> **Comparing drug and search rates**\n> \n> As you saw in the last exercise, the rate of drug-related stops increased significantly between 2005 and 2015. You might hypothesize that the rate of vehicle searches was also increasing, which would have led to an increase in drug-related stops even if more drivers were not carrying drugs.\n> \n> You can test this hypothesis by calculating the annual search rate, and then plotting it against the annual drug rate. If the hypothesis is true, then you'll see both rates increasing over time.","7b623170":"### Using proper data types","3d44c4de":"### Does gender affect who is frisked during a search?","c717c488":"> **Plotting the temperature**\n> \n> In this exercise, you'll examine the temperature columns from the weather dataset to assess whether the data seems trustworthy. First you'll print the summary statistics, and then you'll visualize the data using a box plot.\n> \n> When deciding whether the values seem reasonable, keep in mind that the temperature is measured in degrees Fahrenheit, not Celsius!","c3d03919":"> **Plotting stop length**\n> \n> If you were stopped for a particular violation, how long might you expect to be detained?\n> \n> In this exercise, you'll visualize the average length of time drivers are stopped for each type of violation. Rather than using the violation column in this exercise, you'll use violation_raw since it contains more detailed descriptions of the violations."}}
