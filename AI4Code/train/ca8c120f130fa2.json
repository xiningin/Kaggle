This document examines and shows the delay and cancellation causes in several aspects.\n\nI have come up with tableau data visualisation to show case the delay of flights using 366,000 observations of the dataset and provide a holistic destination map data visualisation in tableau.    \n\nPlease feel free to play around with different flight combinations to observe the visualisations\n\nThe following visualisations comprises of \n\n#### 1.
