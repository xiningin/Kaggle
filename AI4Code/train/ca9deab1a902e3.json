Essentially, the ranking is transformed into a pairwise regression problem. The algorithm compares pairs of items and comes up with the optimal ordering for that pair, iterating through the different pairs to extrapolate with the final ranking of all items.\n\nThe business metric is the rank, not the MAE. Unfortunately, I've found the LGBM lambdarank implementation quite confusing and was unsuccessful at using it. As such we will optimize our algorithm using an MAE objective.\n\nLimitations using MAE:\n- The predictions are not bound, as such we can have some predictions falling above\/below our percentile range\n- The predictions are not going to be unique, you could have several players\/teams assigned same scores\n\n\n**Target variable:** Percentile\n\nIn a  game of PUBG, each team gets assigned a percentile value so there should approximatly be the same cout of 0s, 0.5s, 1s etc. (there might be irregularities in the distribution due imbalance in team sizes or number of teams). We should expect to see a uniform distribution for all percentile scores value, and a gaussian distribution with mean 0.5 for the average percentile score per match.

But atleast they deal with some damage","e636b7f7":"We\u2019ll be using data collected by Kaggle via the [PUBG Developer API](https:\/\/developer.pubg.com\/). The dataset comprises of 65,000 games worth of anonymised player data, split into training and tests sets. For the purposes of this exploratory analysis we\u2019re only going to be looking at the training data set.\n\nThe training set comes in the form of a .CSV file. This file contains 113,290,736 individual data points in 26 columns and 4,357,336 rows.\n- **groupId** - Integer ID to identify a group within a match. If the same group of players plays in different matches, they will have a different groupId each time. \n\n(**Think:** *Will groupID add any value in our prediction?)*\n- **matchId** - Integer ID to identify match. There are no matches that are in both the training and testing set.\n\n(**Think:** *Why matchID won't add any value in our prediction?)*\n- **assists** - Number of times you helped your friend when he killed an enemy\n- **boosts** - Number of boost items used.\n\n**What is it ?** Boost may refer to Energy Drink,Painkillers, Adrenaline Syringe\n\n**About:** The boost bar is a thin white line visible above the health bar. It is cut into 4 sections, which fill up when the player uses a boost item. The first section of the boost bar lasts for 1 minute and will heal 1% health every 8 seconds, for a total of 7% health.\n- **damageDealt** - Total damage dealt. Note: Self inflicted damage is subtracted.\n- **DBNOs** - Number of enemy players knocked\n\n**What is it?** Stands for 'Down But No Out'. During Duo or squad play, when you lose all your hit points(HP), you get into this mode. In this mode, your duo or squad members can heal you and that is why we don't count this as an out.\n'Revive State' is a feature in BATTLEGROUNDS that can be used to revive downed squad mates. Once your HP reaches 0 you will go into a DBNO state. You can only crawl and drop items, but you cannot shoot or use items while in this state.\n- **headshotKills** - Number of enemies you killed with headshots.\n- **heals** - Number of healing items used.\n\n(**Think:** *Will heals add any value in predicting finish placement?)*\n\n**About:** There are three basic health items in PUBG: Bandages, First Aid Kits and Med Kits. These all restore your health bar. \n- **killPlace** - Your ranking in match in terms of number of enemy players killed.\n- **killPoints** - Kills-based external ranking of player. (Ranking where only winning matters).\n- **kills** - Number of enemy players killed.\n- **killStreaks** - Max number of enemy players killed in a short amount of time. A Killstreak is earned when a player acquires a certain number of kills in a row without dying.\n- **longestKill** - Longest distance between player and player killed at time of death. This may be misleading, as downing a - player and driving away may lead to a large longestKill stat.\n- **maxPlace** - Worst placement we have data for in the match. This may not match with numGroups, as sometimes the data skips over placements.\n- **numGroups** - Number of groups we have data for in the match.\n- **revives** - Number of times you revived your teammates.\n- **rideDistance** - Total distance traveled in vehicles (measured in meters).\n- **roadKills** - Number of enemy killed while travelling in a vehicle.\n- **swimDistance** - Total distance traveled by swimming (measured in meters).\n- **teamKills** - Number of times you are killed your teammate.\n- **vehicleDestroys** - Number of vehicles destroyed.\n- **walkDistance** - Total distance traveled on foot (measured in meters).\n- **weaponsAcquired** - Number of weapons picked up.\n- **winPoints** - Win-based external ranking of player. (Ranking where only winning matters).\n- **winPlacePerc** - The target of prediction **(Target Variable)**. This is a percentile winning placement, where 1 corresponds to 1st place, and 0 corresponds to last place in the match. It is calculated off of maxPlace, not numGroups, so it is possible to have missing chunks in a match.","1dd5de5e":"Is it even posssible to snipe (kill) someone from a distance > 1Km in this game?\n\nLet's take a look at the players who took these shots.","d1e9e42e":"# Getting prepared for Machine Learning <a id=\"8\"><\/a>","cc25dae1":"Let's take a look at the players who make these shots.","b284d805":"##Removing variables with high correlation between them","99419bbd":"![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/hxbfBFI.gif)","9d05f7f2":"### 100% Headshot Kills\n","e7642283":"##Loading the Data","fefa0a37":"There are a few matches with less than 75 players that cannot be displayed here.

Players (**Id**) can be on teams (**groupId**) which get ranked at the end of the game (**winPlacePerc**) based on how many other teams are still alive when they are eliminated. During the game, players can pick up different amunitions, revive downed-but-not-dead (knocked) teammates, drive vehicles, swim, run, shoot, and experience all of the consequences -- such as falling too far or running themselves over and eliminating themselves.\n\nThe team at [PUBG](https:\/\/www.pubg.com\/) has made official game data available for the public to explore and scavenge outside of \"The Blue Circle.\" This workshop is not an official or affiliated PUBG site. Its based on the data collected by Kaggle and made available through the [PUBG Developer API](https:\/\/developer.pubg.com\/).\n\nYou are provided with a large number of anonymized PUBG game stats, formatted so that each row contains one player's post-game stats. The data comes from matches of all types: solos, duos, squads, and custom; there is no guarantee of there being 100 players per match, nor at most 4 player per group.\n\n**Goal:** \n\nPerform the PUBG data analysis and answer the following questions:\n\n- Does killing more people increases the chance of winning the game?\n  - **Hint:** Use the correlation between the match winning percentage and number of kills to determine the relationship\n\n- How do we catch the fraudsters in the game?\n - **Hint:** Use various logical conditions based on game knowledge to determine fraudsters in the game\n\n- Can we predict the finishing position of a player in the game?\n - **Hint:** Regression Problem: Train and test a model using regression algorithm to predict the final position of the player at the end of the game. Create a model which **predicts players' finishing placement** based on their final stats, on a scale from 1 (first place) to 0 (last place).\n\n\n\n\n![](https:\/\/thumbs.gfycat.com\/SlimyInsignificantDolphin-max-1mb.gif)","6cd8351e":"## Defining function for calculating Mean Absolute Error (MAE)","479c9cf9":"#Check correlation of the feature with Winning Percentage","4d23dcdc":"#PUBG: Battle Royale - Finish Placement Prediction","dc8e19bd":"###Killing without Moving\nIdentify the fraudsters who can making kills without even moving.

Some of the characteristics of this anomalous data include the following:\n\n- Many kills without moving\n- Many roadkills while driving a very short distance\n- Suspiciously high number of kills\n- Suspiciously long range kills\n\nWe can have a debate on whether to drop this data or not; however, hackers and custom games exist in the test set, so we decided that it is valuable information when training our models.\n\n**Corrupt Data:** Due to issues with the API, there is a bug with the groupID column. When a player leaves a match and rejoins, their groupID is reassigned, which causes the creation of larger groups than a gamemode would allow. A squad match only allows 4 people per team. In other words there should be at most 4 of the same groupID\u2019s per team. But because of the bug, we found examples violating this rule in the data. This creates issues when creating team related features as it makes difficult to distinguish the teams.\n\n**Useless Data:** Some features like matchId is only useful for feature extraction such as for finding total players in a match. Because matchId is a hex identifier string, it is not ordinal and has very high unique value count, so we cannot one hot encode it as a categorical. We also found that matchID has very little predictive performance on its own.","8f7e2818":"Some rows in our dataset have weird characteristics.
