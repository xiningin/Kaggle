Today I'm going to explain you basic commands and topics about matplotlib. So let's begin.\n\nMatplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose GUI toolkits like Tkinter, wxPython, Qt, or GTK+.Matplotlib graphics can be edited very elegantly, but here we will focus on the basic features. We have an Iris dataset here. Now we're going to apply matplotlib and see some of basic topics like \"line plot\", \"scatter plot\", \"bar plot\", \"subplot\" and \"histogram\".","e58ecce8":"Subplot shows piece by piece ->","115db77f":"First of all we should write data's path.  ","8b421eb8":"With .info() we can easily see basic informations about data frame.","6a732adb":"Pyplot is used for visualising.
