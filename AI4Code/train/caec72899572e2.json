Most attributes with missing values are categorical attrbiutes, and it is legitimate for some houses to not to have a pool\/basement\/garage\/perk\/alley access\/fence so I'm going to fill those missing categories with \"No Feature\" (but drop GarageYrBlt since there is no point in filling the year)\n2. For 'Electrical', just delete the missing record - not worth the effort to deal with it\n3. For 'LotFrontage' and 'MasVnrArea, I'll check the scatterplot and decide if there is a relationship with sales price","1ca813a0":"How about perks? I'd be willing to pay a little more rent if there are gyms or pools in the building. Same pattern observed in this data set, especially those with a second perk.","7c8f3be8":"There is not an obvious trend when looking at sold year-month, but there are price spikes for houses built before 1900 and around 1930. It's a bit counterintuitive that older houses have the same price as newly built houses, and there may be something else that dominated the price but manifested through YearBuilt. What about correlations between top numeric features?","06836b48":"Differences in housing style and zones have impacts on price ranges \n<br>\nFor example, newer dwelings are more expensive than older dwellings of the same age, and low density residences have higher median price than medium to high density residences","26e9629c":"Top attributes related to sales price: OverallQual, MasVnrArea, YearBuilt\/YearRemodAdd, TotalBsmtSF\/1stFlrSF, GrLivArea, FullBath, TotRmsAbvGrd, Fireplaces, GarageCars, GarageArea.

I'll fill the missing values with medians of the column (not to disrupt the distributions) and decide on what to keep when doing grid search in model training","3a74e01b":"How about quality? It certainly affects prices since nobody wants to spend a lot on a broken home and even more to fix it. Looks like there are price gaps between excellent\/good conditions and other conditions, but nothing too much if falling under excellent\/good.","aa339646":"Let's take a look at attributes with missing values and decide what to do with them. A few things I would consider when making those decisions:\n1. Is it legitimate to have missing values? For example if the house doesn't have a pool, then it is fine to have PoolQC as NULL. If it is OK to have missing values, and if there is not an indicator in the dataset, maybe it's a good idea to add one\n2. Is it related to other variables that are not missing? If so just keep the one without missing value and drop the one with it\n3. What's the impact of missing data on the analysis? This can be assessed by looking at\n    * What's the percentage of missing records compared to the total # of records? If it's small enough, just delete the records with missing values\n    * How likely the attribute will affect the target variable? If it is a useless attribute anyway, let's just exclude it\n4. How to backfill the important missing values? \n    * Do we want to fill them with some statistics (average, median, most frequent)?\n    * Do we want to infer them using some rules or even more advanced modeling techniques? (usually rules are good enough)"}}
