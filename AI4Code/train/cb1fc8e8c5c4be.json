As we can see, players overall in FIFA 19 are follow a normal distribution where the mean is 66.24. As a FIFA players who most of the time play Real Madrid, I'm quite surprised by this mean ('cause if I have a player with the overall 66.24, I will totally sell them).\n\nIn the box plot, we can see that the median of players overall is around 66, which is not too far from the mean. There are some outliers too on the upper and bottom whiskers. A player like Messi or Ronaldo or Lewandowski of course are not just regular player (somewhere between 25th and 75th percentile), they definitely is the upper outliers.
