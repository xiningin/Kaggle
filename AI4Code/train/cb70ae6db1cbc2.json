start using a Machine Learning Model, it needs to be effectively deployed into production, so that they can provide predictions to other software systems.\n\n\u25cfTo maximize the value of the Machine Learning Model, we need to be able to reliably extract the predictions and share them with other systems.\n\n\n**Research Environment**\n\n\u25cfThe Research Environment is a setting with tools, programs and software suitable for data analysis and the development of machine learning models.\n\n\u25cfHere, we develop the Machine Learning Models and identify their value.\nIts done by a data scientist : i prefer work on jupyter for this phase .\n\n**Production Environment**\n\n\u25cfThe Production Environment is a real-time setting with running programs and hardware setups that allow the

CRISP-DM stands for Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining. It is an open standard guide that describes common approaches that are used by data mining experts. CRISP-DM includes descriptions of the typical phases of a project, including tasks details and provides an overview of the data mining lifecycle. The lifecycle model consists of six phases with arrows indicating the most important and frequent dependencies between phases. The sequence of the phases is not strict. In fact, most projects move back and forth between phases as necessary. It starts with business understanding, and then moves to data understanding, data preparation, modelling, evaluation, and deployment. The CRISP-DM model is flexible and can be customized easily.\n## Buissness Understanding\n\n    Tasks:\n\n    1.Determine business objectives\n\n    2.Assess situation\n\n    3.Determine data mining goals\n\n    4.Produce project plan\n\n## Data Understanding\n     Tasks:\n\n    1.Collect data\n\n    2.Describe data\n\n    3.Explore data    \n\n## Data Preparation\n    \n    Tasks:\n    \n    1.Data selection\n\n    2.Data preprocessing\n\n    3.Feature engineering\n\n    4.Dimensionality reduction\n\n            Steps:\n\n            Data cleaning\n\n            Data integration\n\n            Data sampling\n\n            Data dimensionality reduction\n\n            Data formatting\n\n            Data transformation\n\n            Scaling\n\n            Aggregation\n\n            Decomposition\n\n## Data Modeling :\n\nModeling is the part of the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) process model that i like best.

In this dataset, you are provided the sender and recipient of a transaction as well as whether transactions are tagged as fraud or not fraud. Your task is to build a fraud detection API that can be called to predict whether or not a transaction is fraudulent.\nYou can download the dataset here:https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/bannourchaker\/frauddetection\n    \nYou are expected to build a REST API that predicts whether a given transaction is fraudulent or not. You are also to assume that the previous API calls are to be stored in order to engineer\nfeatures relevant to finding fraud. The API calls will include the time step of the transaction, so you can assume that a transaction happens sequentially within the same time step.\nFor example, if I make the following transactions in the same time step:  \n    \n    \nThe first transaction is unlikely to be fraudulent, since anon is initiating a normal transfer.\nHowever, multiple successive transfers of the same amount in the same hour is potentially fraudulent, since anon\u2019s account might have been taken over by a fraudster. On the first API call,your model is unlikely to classify the transaction as fraudulent. However, on the fifth call, it\u2019s likely that it will be tagged as fraudulent.\nThe REST API only has 1 endpoint \/is-fraud that takes in a POST request:\n    \nThe body is expected to receive the following fields(which are also the fields that can be found in your dataset:\nThe following is a sample body when making a POST request to your\n    \n    \n            {\n        \"step\":1,\n        \"type\":\"PAYMENT\",\n        \"amount\":9839.64,\n        \"nameOrig\":\"C1231006815\",\n        \"oldbalanceOrig\":170136.0,\n        \"newbalanceOrig\":160296.36,\n        \"nameDest\":\"M1979787155\",\n        \"oldbalanceDest\":0.0,\n        \"newbalanceDest\":0.0\n        }\n    \n    \nYour API is expected to return a JSON object with a boolean field isFraud. You may find a\nsample response below:\n    \n    {\"isFraud\": true}\n    \n**summary:**\nwe are expecting the following:\n    \n- 1. Deployed REST API:\n    \n    a. As mentioned above, we would need an API that takes in a POST request for the\n    \/is-fraud url and returns a prediction on whether or not a transaction is\n    fraudulent.\n    \n    b. Your REST API should be public for us to call the API and evaluate the accuracy\n    of your model\n    \n    c. Given the nature of the data, your REST API will likely need to take into account\n    previous transactions, so make sure it is able to take note of transactions from\n    your training dataset as well as previous API calls.\n\n- 2. Model\n    \n    a. We are expecting a machine learning model that can correctly classify whether or\n    not a transaction is fraudulent.\n\n**What is the objective of the machine learning model?**\n\nWe aim to predict  the real transactions fraud  and the fraud estimated by our model. We will evaluate model performance with the:\n\n   - F beta score\n    \n   - ROC AUC score\n    \n   - PR AUC score | Average precision\n    \n    \n## Step 1: Import helpful libraries","e78cb8ad":"# What should we do for each colmun\n\n**Separate features by dtype**\n\nNext we\u2019ll separate the features in the dataframe by their datatype.

Appending .columns to the end returns an Index list containing the column names.

That is, data sets with high kurtosis tend to have heavy tails, or outliers. \n\n\u00b7 Kurtosis describes the peakedness of the distribution.\n\n\u00b7 If the distribution is tall and thin it is called a leptokurtic distribution(Kurtosis > 3). Values in a leptokurtic distribution are near the mean or at the extremes.\n\n\u00b7 A flat distribution where the values are moderately spread out (i.e., unlike leptokurtic) is called platykurtic(Kurtosis <3) distribution.\n\n\u00b7 A distribution whose shape is in between a leptokurtic distribution and a platykurtic distribution is called a mesokurtic(Kurtosis=3) distribution. A mesokurtic distribution looks more close to a normal distribution.\n\n\u00b7 Kurtosis is sometimes reported as \u201cexcess kurtosis.\u201d Excess kurtosis is determined by subtracting 3 from the kurtosis. This makes the normal distribution kurtosis equal 0.\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n\u00b7 Along with skewness, kurtosis is an important descriptive statistic of data distribution. However, the two concepts must not be confused with each other. Skewness essentially measures the symmetry of the distribution, while kurtosis determines the heaviness of the distribution tails.\n\n\u00b7 It is the sharpness of the peak of a frequency-distribution curve .It is actually the measure of outliers present in the distribution.\n\n\u00b7 **High kurtosis** in a data set is an indicator that **data has heavy outliers**.\n\n\u00b7 **Low kurtosis** in a data set is an indicator that **data has lack of outliers.**\n\n    The kurtosis of a normal distribution is 3.\n    If a given distribution has a kurtosis less than 3, it is said to be playkurtic, which means it tends to produce fewer and less extreme outliers than the normal distribution.\n    If a given distribution has a kurtosis greater than 3, it is said to be leptokurtic, which means it tends to produce more outliers than the normal distribution.","c247fddd":"# Visual Exploratory","3da3350b":"**Num Features**\n\n","8737e47f":"# Reduce Memory: \nBe aware for high resolution features don't use it ","81014fe4":"<a id=5><\/a>\n<h3 class=\"list-group-item list-group-item-action active\" data-toggle=\"list\" style='color:white; background:#1777C4; border:0' role=\"tab\" aria-controls=\"home\">\n<center>Evaluation<\/center><\/h3>\n\n# Model accuracy scoring\n\nThe easiest way to analyze performance is with accuracy. \nIt measures how many observations, both positive and negative, were correctly classified.\n\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t use accuracy on imbalanced problems. Then, it is easy to get a high accuracy score by simply classifying all observations as the majority class. For example in our case, by classifying all transactions as non-fraudulent we can get an accuracy of over 0.9.\n\n**When to use it:**\n\n    When your problem is balanced using accuracy is usually a good start. An additional benefit is that it is really easy to explain it to non-technical stakeholders in your project,\n    When every class is equally important to you.\n\n# Confusion Matrix\n\n**How to compute:**\n\nIt is a common way of presenting true positive (tp), true negative (tn), false positive (fp) and false negative (fn) predictions. Those values are presented in the form of a matrix where the Y-axis shows the true classes while the X-axis shows the predicted classes.\n\nIt is calculated on class predictions, which means the outputs from your model need to be thresholded first.\n\n**When to use it:**\n\n    Pretty much always. I like to see the nominal values rather than normalized to get a feeling on how the model is doing on different, often imbalanced, classes.\n\n\n\n# ROC Curve\n\n\nIt is a chart that visualizes the tradeoff between true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR). Basically, for every threshold, we calculate TPR and FPR and plot it on one chart.\n\nOf course, the higher TPR and the lower FPR is for each threshold the better and so classifiers that have curves that are more top-left side are better.\n\nSince we have an imbalanced data set, Receiver Operating Characteristic Curves are not that useful although it's an expected output of most binary classifiers.\nBecause you can generate a pretty good-looking curve by just simply guessing each one is the non-fraud case.\n\n**When to use it:**\n\n    You should use it when you ultimately care about ranking predictions and not necessarily about outputting well-calibrated probabilities (read this article by Jason Brownlee if you want to learn about probability calibration).\n    You should not use it when your data is heavily imbalanced. It was discussed extensively in this article by Takaya Saito and Marc Rehmsmeier. The intuition is the following: false positive rate for highly imbalanced datasets is pulled down due to a large number of true negatives.\n    You should use it when you care equally about positive and negative classes.. If we care about true negatives as much as we care about true positives then it totally makes sense to use ROC AUC.\n    \n# ROC AUC score   \nAUC - ROC curve is a performance measurement for the classification problems at various threshold settings. ROC is a probability curve and AUC represents the degree or measure of separability. It tells how much the model is capable of distinguishing between classes. Higher the AUC, the better the model is at predicting 0 classes as 0 and 1 classes as 1. By analogy, the Higher the AUC, the better the model is at distinguishing between patients with the disease and no disease. The ROC curve is plotted with TPR against the FPR where TPR is on the y-axis and FPR is on the x-axis.\n\n**When to use it:**\n\n    You should use it when you ultimately care about ranking predictions and not necessarily about outputting well-calibrated probabilities (read this article by Jason Brownlee if you want to learn about probability calibration).\n    You should not use it when your data is heavily imbalanced. It was discussed extensively in this article by Takaya Saito and Marc Rehmsmeier. The intuition is the following: false positive rate for highly imbalanced datasets is pulled down due to a large number of true negatives.\n    You should use it when you care equally about positive and negative classes. It naturally extends the imbalanced data discussion from the last section. If we care about true negatives as much as we care about true positives then it totally makes sense to use ROC AUC.\n\n# Recall    \nIt measures how many observations out of all positive observations have we classified as positive. It tells us how many fraudulent transactions we recalled from all fraudulent transactions.\ntrue positive rate\n\nWhen you are optimizing recall you want to put all guilty in prison.\n**When to use it:**\n\n    Usually, you will not use it alone but rather coupled with other metrics like precision.\n    That being said, recall is a go-to metric, when you really care about catching all fraudulent transactions even at a cost of false alerts. Potentially it is cheap for you to process those alerts and very expensive when the transaction goes unseen.\n    \n# Precision\n\nIt measures how many observations predicted as positive are in fact positive. Taking our fraud detection example, it tells us what is the ratio of transactions correctly classified as fraudulent.\npositive predictive value\n\nWhen you are optimizing precision you want to make sure that people that you put in prison are guilty. \n\n**When to use it:**\n\n    Again, it usually doesn\u2019t make sense to use it alone but rather coupled with other metrics like recall.\n    When raising false alerts is costly, when you want all the positive predictions to be worth looking at you should optimize for precision.\n    \n\n\n**Precision vs. Recall for Imbalanced Classification:**\n\nYou may decide to use precision or recall on your imbalanced classification problem.\n\nMaximizing precision will minimize the number false positives, whereas maximizing the recall will minimize the number of false negatives.\n\n    Precision: Appropriate when minimizing false positives is the focus.\n    Recall: Appropriate when minimizing false negatives is the focus.\n\nSometimes, we want excellent predictions of the positive class. We want high precision and high recall.\n\nThis can be challenging, as often increases in recall often come at the expense of decreases in precision.\n\n    In imbalanced datasets, the goal is to improve recall without hurting precision. These goals, however, are often conflicting, since in order to increase the TP for the minority class, the number of FP is also often increased, resulting in reduced precision.\n    \n    \n# PR AUC score | Average precision\n\nSimilarly to ROC AUC score you can calculate the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve to get one number that describes model performance.\n\nYou can also think about PR AUC as the average of precision scores calculated for each recall threshold [0.0, 1.0]. You can also adjust this definition to suit your business needs by choosing\/clipping recall thresholds if needed.\n\n**When to use it:**\n\n    when you want to communicate precision\/recall decision to other stakeholders\n    when you want to choose the threshold that fits the business problem.\n    when your data is heavily imbalanced. As mentioned before, it was discussed extensively in this article by Takaya Saito and Marc Rehmsmeier. The intuition is the following: since PR AUC focuses mainly on the positive class (PPV and TPR) it cares less about the frequent negative class.\n    when you care more about positive than negative class. If you care more about the positive class and hence PPV and TPR you should go with Precision-Recall curve and PR AUC (average precision).\n    \n# F beta score\n\nSimply put, it combines precision and recall into one metric. The higher the score the better our model is. You can calculate it in the following way:\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen choosing beta in your F-beta score the more you care about recall over precision the higher beta you should choose. For example, with F1 score we care equally about recall and precision with F2 score, recall is twice as important to us.\nF beta by beta\n\nWith 0<beta<1 we care more about precision and so the higher the threshold the higher the F beta score. When beta>1 our optimal threshold moves toward lower thresholds and with beta=1 it is somewhere in the middle.  \n\n**When to use it:**\n\n    Pretty much in every binary classification problem. It is my go-to metric when working on those problems. It can be easily explained to business stakeholders.\n    \n for more details see this article:[https:\/\/neptune.ai\/blog\/evaluation-metrics-binary-classification](http:\/\/)    \n \n==>Complete evaluation will be done when we train the model on all data that we have and with the best tuned model.","1ec382ef":"# Duplicates Data ","cbf8cefb":"\n<a id=2><\/a>\n<h3 class=\"list-group-item list-group-item-action active\" data-toggle=\"list\" style='color:white; background:#1777C4; border:0' role=\"tab\" aria-controls=\"home\">\n<center>Data Understanding<\/center><\/h3>\n\n\n### Explore the data\/Analysis \n\nWe will analyse the following:\n\n    The target variable\n    \n    Variable types (categorical and numerical)\n    \n    Numerical variables\n        Discrete\n        Continuous\n        Distributions\n        Transformations\n\n    Categorical variables\n        Cardinality\n        Rare Labels\n        Special mappings\n\n    Null Data\n\n    Text data \n    \n    wich columns will we use\n    \n    IS there outliers that can destory our algo\n    \n    IS there diffrent range of data\n    \n    Curse of dimm...","7700625b":"\n\nIt's clear tat there is a clear relation betweenamount and step  variables and target.\n\nNow Exploring correlation between all numerical variables.
