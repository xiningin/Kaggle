Which age group people are using facebook most?\nAnalysis : Age 18 group people are most facebook users\n2. Which age group is using facebook from long period of time?\nAnalysis : Considering age groups having 2000+ user, 28 aged group people are using facebook from long period of time\n3. Which age group people have maximum no. of friends?\nAnalysis : 103 aged group people has 1044 users with average friends 462\nwhere as 16 aged group people has 3086 users with average friends 351.\nOut of two observations, considering more no. of users in each age group, 16 aged group of people have highest no. of friends in facebook\n4. In the most used facebook age group,is it male or female used most?\nAnalysis : 18 age group people are most facebook users, in which male count is 3159 and female count is 2037.\nTherefore, in highest facebook users age group also male users are more.\n5.
