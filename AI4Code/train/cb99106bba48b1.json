Engineering**","18e9e094":"Based on our model's prediction - features like getting the first champion kill, early dragon kills and killing more champions in the first 10 minutes of the game increases the chances of a team winning that game.\n\nAll these strategies are true based on the first 10 minutes of the game but may change drastically if we are able to analyze data which has stats for the entire duration of the game.","acce5d1e":"It's clear from the above charts that the blue team won 63% of the time where they had more minion kills in the first 10 minutes of the game.\n\nHowever, there are 37.7% games where the blue team had less number of minion kills but still managed to win the game. \nIt would be interesting to probe more in these games to see what strategy did the blue team adopt to win the game. Since this dataset has only first 10 minutes of the game data, our exploration scope is restricted and can't look at the team strategy in the later part of the game.","a60c2dac":"### Feature Scaling and Selection","fec32cf4":"As per the above list of features selected by Lasso Regression, championkilldifference feature has been alloted the highest coefficient value showing that the it has a high impact on the team wins. This was also evident in our initial data exploration.\n\nSome other interesting features that have come up are dragon kills and first blood. Let talk about these in detail as to why the model is considering these features would impact the winning chances of a team.\n\n1. Dragons killed - Dragons are elite monsters found in the jungle. Depending on which dragon the team kills, they granted some power ups like increase attack or movement speed, etc. Our lasso regression model has selected this feature to impact the winning changes, which ideally makes sense. If the team secure early dragon kills in the game, they get different power ups which in turn help them kill more opposite team's champions and earn more gold.\n\n2. Red First Blood - First bloods are the first champion killed by a team at the start of the game. In this case its Red First Blood and is negative, which means if the red team secures the first blood at the start of the game, it decreases the winning chances of the blue team.\n","5e6fb0d3":"It's evident from the above chart that the more champions you kill, the more you increase your chances of winning. 72.4% of the game were won by the blue team, where had more champion kills in the first 10 minutes of the game.\n\nAgain, there are exceptions, where 31.2% of the games were won by blue team even after having lesser number of champion kills than the red team","832a5494":"Lets focus our analysis on few metrics of the game, which would help the blue team increase their chances of winning in the first 10 minutes of the game. We would be focusing on following metrics and see how they increase blue team's winning chances - \n* Number of minions or creeps killed more than the red team\n* Number of chapions killed more than the red team\n* Number of wards placed more than the red team\n\nWe don't have attributes which show the count difference between the above attributes for the 2 teams. So lets create these attributes in the given dataframe","fe4e3223":"## **Prediction using Logistic Regression**","fab796d0":"* The dataset has a total of 9879 rows and there seems to be no value missing for any attributes.\n* There are a total of 38 attributes in the dataset.\n* The Bluewins is the target variable, which we will be predicting","fa8442b3":"* There is no imbalance in the wins and loss values of the target value"}}
