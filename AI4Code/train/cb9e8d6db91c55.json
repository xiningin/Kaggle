It is hard to draw any conclusion from the graphs above: they all look very similar and we don't have enough data for the plots to  look more smoothly. Though, the Math graph seems to be slightly more shifted to the left when comparing it to other graphs, but it is almost unnoticable. Let's immerse ourselves further into the dataset to explore more interesting correlations!","ee79d4a9":"To be fair, the scores seem to be linearly related to each other, i.e. when someone scores high in maths he is likely to score well in other exams. The are no discrete clusters in the dataset when presented the graph above.","90137e93":"### Exam scores based on the previous education  \nNext question is if the education level of parents can affect the exam scores. Personally, I think that it does have a statistical impact, but let's verify that! ","90f839da":"Surprisingly enough, there is a huge disproportion between students who have a **free\/reduced** lunch when compared to those having **standard** lunch. There might be a sociological reason for that, if you have an idea what is the reason let me know in comments! ","2f38e0eb":"### K-Means\nOnce the data has been preprocessed, we can apply the K-Means algorithm. I used the [Elbow Method](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Elbow_method_(clustering)) to find the optimum number of clusters(it is 5). For the clarity, I won't put that part of the code here, but you can refer to my [Github](https:\/\/github.com\/KacperKubara) page for the full code.","e52e56ae":"We should change the labels of \"some high school\" to \"high school\" and \"some college\" to \"college\".","47481c86":"### Preprocessing\nThere few obstacles to remove before using K-Means algorithm, namely:\n* Numerical scores has to become categorical features\n* Data has to be labelled and one hot encoded\nSince the exam scores are integer values **0-100%**, I had to assign labels for certain value range. For example **0-35%** score becomes **very poor**, **35-55%** becomes **poor**, etc. Once it was done, data was labelled and one hot encoded using modules from sklearn.","39aea0d8":"### Exam scores based on the lunch type  \nIt might be amusing to think that type of lunch students have is correlated to their exam scores. On the other hand, we can see from the dataset that there are two types of lunch: **standard** and **free\/reduced**. So it depends on the parents' financial situation rather than on the type of the dish. There might be some correlation be here, so let's try to visualise the problem.\n","ecce60e4":"## Summary & Conclusions  \n We started analysis from exploring how the features affect the exam scores in the dataset. We could see some obvious relations such as men tend to score better in maths whereas women tend to do well in reading an writing, or students who didn't do the test preparation course scores **5-10%** worse than students who completed the course. There were also some non-obivious relations (the most interesting ones!), such as the fact that education level of the parents affects the exam scores of their children, or lunch type (effectively related to the financial situtation of family) also have an impact on exam scores.  \n  To score well in exams, the social background of the student does have a statistical impact on their academic performance (at least in this dataset). Though, we can observe that students who put more time in the preparation (by doing test preparation course) have much better scores, and one can exceel in the exams just by putting an effort to prepare well!\n   I hope you enjoyed reading my Kernel.

It is time to plot some bar graphs to see the scores' distribution.","356f42ed":"### Exam scores based on the gender  \nIt will be interesting to see how the exam scores differ when we divide the exam results based on gender.","acf14c6b":"  ## Introduction\n  Using the [Students Performance in Exams Dataset](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/spscientist\/students-performance-in-exams) we will try to understand what affects the exam scores. The data is a bit limited, but with a good visualisation it will be fun to spot any relations. After exploring the data, I will apply K-Means algorithm to see if there any clusters in the dataset based on the exam scores. It is my very first Kernel but I will try my best to provide you with some interesting observations from the dataset. For the full code please visit my [Github profile](https:\/\/github.com\/KacperKubara\/Students_Exam_Performance). \n  \n  ## Exploring the data  \n  Let's import the libraries and display first few rows of the dataset to see how the data looks like!  ","20f0cfc3":"### General distribiution of exam scores\nThere are 5 features which might affect the scores of each exam. First thing to analyse would be to see how the scores are distributed within each exam (Maths, Reading, Writing). We will plot histograms to see if there any differences in the scores' distribution","9b21f39b":"### Visualisation \nNow, we can plot the clusters on the 3D plot!","a58f3554":"Hmm... It is hard to spot any differences by looking on bar graphs. But we still can display the mean values as a table or a heatmap.","12a0ffb0":"### Exam scores based on the test preparation course  \nThe last thing I want to explore in this dataset is to determine how the completion of the test preparation course affects the exam scores. There are only two categorical variables: **none** and **completed**. This time, following [Occam's razor principle](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Occam%27s_razor), I will display only the simple table of the means.","b7ea3d3a":"Indeed, it seems that a lower parental level of education has a negative impact on the exam scores. Children of parents whose the highest education level was college or high school have noticeably lower exam scores than their peers. Similarly, parents with master's or bachelor's degree have children who scores much better in the exams.","2af9c751":"## Clustering the data with K-Means\nMy idea was to cluster the dataset to see whether there any similarities between certain groups of students. For example, if there is a particular group of students who scores well in maths but poorly in reading and writing. To do that, I had to preprocess the data and use K-Means algorithm for clustering. I thought about using [PCA](http:\/\/sebastianraschka.com\/Articles\/2014_pca_step_by_step.html), but since I will use only exam scores for the clusters I can easily put the data points on the 3-D scatter plot. ","35934700":"And let's see the mean of each exam score","026f22a7":"Something interesting here! It seems that in this particular dataset women are better in reading and writing, whereas men scores better in maths! It is an interesting observation, in fact you can find a lot of information in the Internet exploring this topic. It also seems that women have more similar results to each other (smaller variance), whereas men's results tend to differ more . "}}
