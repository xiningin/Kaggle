It differs from rainwater harvesting as the runoff is collected from drains or creeks, rather than roofs. It can also include other catchment areas from man made surfaces, such as roads, or other urban environments such as parks, gardens and playing fields.\n\n* A main challenge stormwater harvesting poses is the removal of pollutants in order to make this water available for reuse. Stormwater harvesting is practiced across the United States in Texas and other States as a way to address rising demands as populations rise. Internationally, Australia has been a country also active in stormwater harvesting.\n\n* Water that comes in contact with impervious surfaces becomes polluted and is denominated surface runoff. As the water travels more distance over impervious surfaces it collects an increasing amount of pollutants. https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Stormwater_harvesting","94f45f6e":"* A-HA - CRYING IN THE RAIN (Official Video)\n* I'll never let you see\/The way my broken heart is hurting me\/I've got my pride and I know how to hide\/All the sorrow and pain\nI'll do my crying in the rain\/If I wait for cloudy skies\/You won't know the rain from the tears in my eyes\/You'll never know that I still love you\/So though the heartaches remain\/I'll do my crying in the rain\/Raindrops falling from heaven\/Will never wash away my misery\/But since we're not together\/I'll wait for stormy weather\/To hide these tears I hope you'll never see\/Someday when my crying's done\/I'm gonna wear a smile and walk in the sun\/I may be a fool\/But till then, darling, you'll never see me complain\/I'll do my crying in the rain\/I'll do my crying in the rain\/I'll do my crying in the rain\/I'll do my crying in the rain\n* Source: LyricFind\n* Songwriters: George Edward Chandler \/ Jimmy Chambers \/ Jimmy Helms \/ William Russell Henshall\n* Crying in the Rain lyrics \u00a9 Warner Chappell Music, Inc\n","b1e7c6e2":"Image zimmerman.com.nz","13f05ac3":"Image ascelibrary.org - Using Storm Transposition to Investigate the Relationships between Hydrologic Responses and Spatial Moments of Catchment Rainfall"}}
