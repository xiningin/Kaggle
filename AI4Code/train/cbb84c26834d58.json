CORD-19 is a resource of over 200,000 scholarly articles, including over 100,000 with full text, about COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and related coronaviruses. This freely available dataset is provided to the global research community to apply recent advances in natural language processing and other AI techniques to generate new insights in support of the ongoing fight against this infectious disease. There is a growing urgency for these approaches because of the rapid acceleration in new coronavirus literature, making it difficult for the medical research community to keep up.","12fa9594":"## Importing and Installing Libraries","fa38e822":"### Loading Json Data","b235bde8":"Reference for some of the code in this section: [COVID EDA Initial Exploration Tool](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/ivanegapratama\/covid-eda-initial-exploration-tool)"}}
