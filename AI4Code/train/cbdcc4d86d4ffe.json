The following query will pull the year and type of each crime recorded, and count up how many records appear for each year and type. We create a table to display the data, ordered by year and then by the number of incidences of each crime, and then use `matplotlib` to plot it.","34a915bb":"The code snippet below gives bq_helper the name of the dataset we're interested in, and loads just the first 3 rows to give us an idea of what it looks like.","1cff7e04":"There's a huge amount more to explore inside the Chicago Crime dataset, the purpose of this notebook is just to give a few examples together with some sample code for various SQL queries and various plots. ","2f264f4e":"It's worth noting initially that several of the columns are redundant, e.g. there's no need to call the `year` column if we're calling the `date` column, and there's no need to call `latitude` or `longitude` if we're calling `location`. ","658f47b1":"In this notebook we'll take a look at using SQL commands to access large data sets, together with some simple visualisation techniques for crime data. \n\nWe'll first import some packages we'll need. In order to handle SQL queries we'll use `bq_helper`.","a3a405fd":"![https:\/\/image.ibb.co\/gCh1aK\/thiry.png](https:\/\/image.ibb.co\/gCh1aK\/thiry.png) ","1571177e":"It doesn't look like the narcotics or criminal damage categories vary much, but certainly the other three seem to increase over the summer months, so simply scaling up the data based on how much of the year is remaining is not a good idea. \n\nInstead, we'll compare the data for the first 8 months of 2017 with the data for the first 8 months of 2018. For each of the five crimes we're interesed in we can compute a ratio telling us how much the incidence of that crime has gone up or down so far in 2018, and use that to extrapolate from the 2017 data. We'll use a dashed line on our plot to indicate that the final data point is just a forecast of what to expect.\n\nIn the SQL query below, in order to make sure we're only taking the same chunk of records from 2017 as we have for 2018, we use the `UNIX_SECONDS` function to convert the date to seconds and require that more than a year lies between any record pulled from 2017 and the most recent record in 2018.","d6a31055":"While we've got a good global overview of the crime trends in Chicago, we can also study local trends within the data. Each crime report is associated with a particular ward of the Chicago police department, of which there are 50.\n\nDespite the downward trend above, there seems to be an uptick in assault and theft between 2016 and 2017, and this seems to persist in our 2018 forecast. We'll focus on these two categories in more detail, to see if these increases are confined to particular wards or not. \n\nBelow we create a scatter plot of the percentage change in assault and theft for each ward between 2016 and 2017. The size of each circle corresponds to the total number of assaults and thefts recorded in that ward. In order not to crowd the plot, we only label the points with unusually large increases\/decreases in incidence. ","5ff0499f":"If you're not interested in SQL, you can go ahead and load the whole dataset into memory as a pandas dataframe with the following: \n\n`myquery = \"\"\"SELECT * FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_crime.crime`\"\"\"\ndata = chicago_crime.query_to_pandas(myquery)`\n\nWe're going to use SQL throughout however, as one of the goals of this notebook is to practice for much larger datasets where loading everything into memory isn't an option. \n\nOne of the advantages of SQL is that you can be very precise about what data you want to query, and it's considered good practice to only query what you actually want. In order to do this, let's take a look at how the data is formatted:","3216ef6f":"Our data also comes with precise geographic information, and the natural way to plot data with geographic information is on a map. \n\nWe'll do this with the `bokeh` library, which allows us to pull map data from Google Maps and plot whatever we like on top in just one or two lines of code. Unfortunately kaggle does not allow notebooks to make web queries so this won't work in-browser, but I'll provide the code used below together with an image of the resulting plot. \n\nWe'll take a look at where the most common places for narcotics violations were in 2017. Marking each location clearly on the map would cover the city. Instead we choose a low alpha-value for our marks so that the locations with the most narcotics violations are immediately clear.","434de96a":"While there's a general downward trend among all five categories, what stands out most is the sudden downturn in 2018. This is because we only have partial data for 2018! In order to make a more accurate plot, we could simply not include the 2018 data. But we could also make a forecast about what to expect in 2018. \n\nOne way of doing this is simply to scale up our 2018 figures according to how much of the year we don't have data for. But there's an implicit assumption here that the crime rate doesn't vary over the course of the year. So before we go with this option, let's check the data. The following query pulls records between 2011 and 2017, groups the number of crimes by month, and then plots the data, with a line for each crime of interest."}}
