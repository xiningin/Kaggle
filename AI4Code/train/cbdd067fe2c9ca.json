Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the pricing of cars in the American market, since those may be very different from the Chinese market. Essentially, the company wants to know:\n>- Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a car\n>- How well those variables describe the price of a car\n\nBased on various market surveys, the consulting firm has gathered a large dataset of different types of cars across the American market.\n\n# \ud83c\udfaf Business Goal\nYou are required to model the price of cars with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the independent variables. They can accordingly manipulate the design of the cars, the business strategy etc. to meet certain price levels. Further, the model will be a good way for the management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.\n\n# \ud83d\udcbe Data Preparation\nThere is a variable named CarName which is comprised of two parts: the first word is the name of 'car company' and the second is the 'car model'. For example, chevrolet impala has 'chevrolet' as the car company name and 'impala' as the car model name. You need to consider only company name as the independent variable for model building.\n\n\nThe solution is divided into the following sections: \n1. Data understanding and exploration\n2. Data cleaning\n3. Data preparation\n4. Model building and evaluation","bd64bc18":"# \ud83d\udd0d Data understanding and exploration","3abb9fc6":"# \u2714\ufe0f Correlation Analysis","1ef6e632":"The heatmap shows some useful insights:\n\nCorrelation of price with independent variables:\n- Price is highly (positively) correlated with wheelbase, carlength, carwidth, curbweight, enginesize, horsepower (notice how all of these variables represent the size\/weight\/engine power of the car)\n\n- Price is negatively correlated to ```citympg``` and ```highwaympg``` (-0.70 approximately). This suggest that cars having high mileage may fall in the 'economy' cars category, and are priced lower (think Maruti Alto\/Swift type of cars, which are designed to be affordable by the middle class, who value mileage more than horsepower\/size of car etc.)\n\nCorrelation among independent variables:\n- Many independent variables are highly correlated (look at the top-left part of matrix): wheelbase, carlength, curbweight, enginesize etc. are all measures of 'size\/weight', and are positively correlated \n\n\nThus, while building the model, we'll have to pay attention to multicollinearity (especially linear models, such as linear and logistic regression, suffer more from multicollinearity).","7122a7e4":"## **`car_ID`**"}}
