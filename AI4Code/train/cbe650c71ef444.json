However, distplot is a deprecated function and will be removed in a future version. Alternatively, we can use the `histplot()` and set the kde to True.","d5faaeab":"A boxplot shows the distribution of categorical data in a way that facilitates comparisons. The box corresponds to the area in which the middle 50% of the data lies. It is therefore bounded by the upper and lower quartiles. Outliers are displayed as dots.","bc58a646":"So we basically have\n* total_bill: the total amount spend\n* tip: the tip given\n* sex: the sex of the guest who gave the tip\n* day: the weekday\n* time: the daytime\n* size: the number of guests at this meal\n\nNote that our tips dataset is a pandas DataFrame.","0eca5c86":"# Visualizing with Seaborn\n\nWith this notebook I want to gain some experience with Seaborn. Seaborn is interesting beacause it builds on top of matplotlib and integrates pandas data structures and is therefore a good link between these libraries. We will do some simple visualizations using the tips dataset. The goal is to learn some key functions of seaborn and to show the variety of plots.\n\nFirst, we import the necessary libraries.","3d7f79f5":"The distinction in categorical variables can also be integrated into the jointplot. For example, lets distinguish between the sex and smoker variables.","63028152":"With a barplot we can aggregate categorical data of a function. For example, we can distinguish between sex in the total_bill variable.","8a62d8cd":"Similar to boxplots are stripplots, which represent categorical variables as a scatterplot.","fd95f2d8":"An easy way to plot subsets is using the `FacetGrid.map()` method.
