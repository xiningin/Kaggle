A low energy EDM song which you can't dance to is unlikely to be popular enough for Spotify's Top 50. Perhaps you can find it in \"Relaxing Studying Music\" playlists instead?","85ae0f34":"From the above graph it seems like low speechiness on pop songs does not affect their popularity (maybe when the song is more music and less lyrics). However, when the speechiness increases, the song popularity goes up (maybe because of easy to sing lyrics), and then falls down (maybe because excess lyrics mean less catchiness of the song).","e23ad59b":"A lot of these genres are variations of the 'pop' genre. It would be easier to just club them all together into one genre called 'pop'","afdaf8b3":"### If you liked this notebook, please leave an upvote and\/or a comment! Thanks for reading!","10dbfd47":"It seems like catchy pop songs that are easy to sing or fun to dance to will continue to dominate the Top 50 charts on Spotify. For other genres such as EDM, high energy or high danceability is a must if they wish to gain a spot on the top charts, while facing fierce competition form reggaetton songs, which are usually very high on danceability levels.","aacf3580":"### Features\n\n* **Danceability** = Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity.\n* **Energy** = Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy.\n* **Liveness** = Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live.\n* **Loudness** = The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks. Loudness is the quality of a sound that is the primary psychological correlate of physical strength (amplitude).\n* **Speechiness** = Detects the presence of spoken words in a track.","0fda0dc6":"Low energy songs like Senorita may also have a higher danceablity factor, while catchy songs like Ariana's 'boyfriend' may have high energy and low danceablity. We shall combine these two attributes into a feature called **\"Usability\"**, i.e. is someone likely to sing or dance to  this song.","0f82fdec":"Let's look at the graph for Speechiness vs Popularity for these pop songs","f5f9d3c4":"# I love Spotify.\nThe Top 50 playlist is one I visit often when I need to find new music. About half the time, I end up liking a song from the playlist a lot, otherwise I simply detest it. Now, my music taste varies between alt-pop and I generally prefer songs that are almost happy but sad at the same time. But does the whole world share the same views as me, or am I just an outlier? \nLet's check out this dataset to find out further."}}
