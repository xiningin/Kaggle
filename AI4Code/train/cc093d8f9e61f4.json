to be the general consensus here. As mentioned previously, the high unemployment rates caused by COVID-19 have resulted in many people trying their hand at freelancing. Moreover, due to the tough economy, the increase in competition has also been matched by more companies outsourcing as a cheaper alternative to hiring someone full-time.","56e23d74":"# **Freelancer Survey Analysis - From Clients to Coconuts**","a5921e1b":"*If 52% of freelancers wish they had a more stable salary and 55% hope to have better business stability, perhaps it is about a quarter of all freelancers who don't seem to be crushing it (yet, at least). It might be a better move to drop the desired for complete \"freeeeeedooooom!\" and go back to the day job. That would fulfill both of the hopes, wouldn't it? Freelancing is not for everyone.*\n\nI can agree that freelancing isn't for everyone, it's a lot of work and you need to be good at motivating yourself. As a freelancer, there's no boss guiding you to make sure you're performing at your best; something which some people need. However, one of the best things about freelancing is that even though it's hard work, you're working hard for yourself. When you couple this with doing something you love, it can be easy to feel like you aren't doing any work at all. Despite this, it's essential to look after yourself freelancers, so if you're in the 'What Chrismas break?' category, then take that holiday time you've been thinking about!","d5b441f1":"Welcome! This notebook contains the results and insights from 50 polls taken on LinkedIn, which were aimed at freelancers.\n\nThe results were gathered by [Dr. Mikko J. Rissanen](https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/mikkor\/), a freelancer working primarily in the AR\/VR space. The polls were taken to help give him an insight into the average freelancer, enabling him to produce higher quality content on his website [CoachLancer](https:\/\/www.coachlancer.com\/). CoachLancer aims to assist anyone on the freelancer journey, with advice ranging from getting more clients to general pro tips. You may also know Mikko as 'that coconut guy from LinkedIn'.\n\nAs a freelance data scientist, I thought it would be cool to build upon Mikko's work, compiling the survey results here on Kaggle where others can dissect the data as they see fit. I also thought that it may be helpful to visualize the data so that anyone interested can quickly analyze the data and find their own insights. This data gives a window into the life of a freelancer. As a result, it is primarily aimed at anyone currently working as a freelancer or interested in becoming one. If you're not in that boat but would still like to dig into the findings, please feel free to continue! If you'd like to discuss my conclusions further or offer any suggestions\/insights of your own, please feel free to drop me a message [here](http:\/\/https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/alfie-grace-b285ab161\/) on LinkedIn. Otherwise, you can drop a comment right here on Kaggle.\n\n*Mikko has provided some of his own insights to contribute to the article. You can recognize Mikko's contributions by looking for any blocks of italicized text, similar to this one!*\n\n**The questions have been split into 6 core themes:**\n\n* The Clients - Choosing a Boss\n* The Journey - From Beginner to Veteran\n* The Marketing - Generating Leads for a Freelance Business\n* The Execution - From Leads to Happy Clients\n* The Finances - Picking the Right Price\n* The Fun Stuff - Coconuts, Lifestyle and Everything Else","846d6c60":"## **The Fun Stuff - Coconuts, Lifestyle and Everything Else**","9b2558f8":"The impression I've gotten from various sources is that different freelance sites can be suitable for different types of services. That being said, I can see why Upwork is doing so well. They've been killing it recently!","528111ad":"## **The Execution - From Leads to Happy Clients**\n\nThis section is dedicated to the day-to-day of freelancer life, looking at some of their key challenges and how freelancers like to work.","97090bb0":"I'm glad to see that it's just a minority falling into the 'Don't know, don't care!' category. The reality is, when talking about your contract history with potential clients, it can be beneficial to understand whether your ex-clients make money business-to-business (B2B) or business-to-customer (B2C). Unfortunately, I haven't worked with anyone on the business-to-coconuts model just yet, so I can't quite comment on that one.","ef3ea7e0":"*When asked about their freelancing philosophy, 28% of freelancers say their COCONUT IS HALF FULL. 0% think it is half empty (as nobody should think). Fortunately, though, 62% prefer to finish the coconut, then get another, which is the right way to freelance. Sadly, 10% don\u2019t give a ****, because it\u2019s just a fruit (but at least now they know coconut is technically not a nut at all, it is indeed a fruit).*\n\n*42% of freelancers say their FAVORITE COLOR IS COCONUT GREEN. Coconut brown came second (20%), coconut yellow third (7%). Blue was the wrong answer, even if 31% thought the opposite. Obviously, it\u2019s just wrong, no matter what Monty Python says. Needless to mention any other colors as they are simply not well-suited for freelancers*","33a14c94":"It's no surprise at all to see such a considerable portion of new freelancers. It's no secret that the high unemployment rates caused by COVID-19 have resulted in a massive influx of new freelancers eager to try out a new way of working.","5e05c387":"It seems that the main priority for most respondents is to get more clients; for the most part, more clients = more money, so it makes sense this is something that a lot of freelancers are focused on.\n\nBuilding a freelance business on Upwork can be challenging, but it's definitely doable. If it was easy, then everyone would do it!\n\n*51% of the freelancers think Upwork is either very or insanely hard for building a freelance business. No surprise there. That place is tough.*","e2dd0027":"*46% believe that the best way to start #freelancing is to join a freelance site. Think again! For instance, half of the people joining Upwork never see a penny!*","2320b695":"It makes sense that an overwhelming majority of the respondents have selected 2 to 3 clients in parallel as their preferred working style. Freelancing can be a risky business, but you reduce the damage that losing a single client can have on your finances by diversifying your income sources. Unfortunately, contracts reach a natural end all the time. With multiple clients part-time, you only need to replace the income from one client when this happens, resulting in far fewer sleepless nights!\n\nOn the other hand, it's surprising that 14% of the respondents work with 6 clients or more. The most amount of clients I've ever worked with concurrently is four and I found that a lot of juggling was involved to ensure I was keeping them all happy. So 6 seems like it would definitely be a struggle, although I suppose it also depends on what kind of services you're offering.\n\nDon't quote me on this, but the 34\/30\/22\/14 split on client types could be related to the experience distribution of the freelancers surveyed. Generally speaking, only the most experienced freelancers have access to those big-ticket corporate clients that pay by the bucketload, whereas everyone has access to individual clients.","f80ceae1":"Interestingly, only a slim majority of respondents thank that actually doing the work is the easy part; maybe looking for more challenging gigs will result in clients that pay better!\n\nChanging requirements is definitely a struggle and it's easy to see why a lot of the freelancers surveyed would agree. There's not much that's more demoralizing than when you're ready to wrap up on a project only for the client to change their expectations at the last minute. ","e45bc6de":"It's hard to put an exact price on your services. Theoretically, clients should be paying for the value that a freelancer adds to their business. However, in reality, freelancing can be very competitive, so you also need to be aware of the going rate for your services, especially when you haven't got the pedigree to demand those coveted top-tier rates.","f822b4b2":"The majority here is in the 'Not very, I need more clients!' boat. One of the main joys of freelancing is working with new people on fun new projects, so it makes sense that even well-established freelancers are already looking for the next client. Personally, it's been three months since I've taken on a new client, so maybe it's time I put myself back out there.","ab903d46":"I can see why most respondents would favor a mixture of both contract types. Fixed-price contracts are outstanding if you can do them quickly, resulting in a nice lump sum and putting a dent in your targets. On the other hand, if you don't plan your time well, fixed-price gigs can very quickly result in you not getting much bang for your buck. The great thing about hourly contracts is that regardless of how long a project takes you, you're going to be reimbursed for your time. However, some freelancers have a problem with hourly gigs because as you become more skilled, you can also get jobs done quicker. This results in less billing time.","dc476fd1":"## **The Finances - Picking the Right Price**\n\nClients, marketing and strategy all lead towards one thing - making money! As a result, it's essential to ensure that your freelance business is geared towards making all the hard work worth your while. This section explores how respondents go about pulling in the correct prices for their services.","7319b227":"From a financial standpoint, it's understandable that 'Long-term, part-time' is the winner here. With 2 or 3 long-term\/part-time contracts under your belt, you've got a steady source of income for the foreseeable future.","94585d0e":"*Only 9% say it is coconuts. This result is highly disappointing to me, personally. Don\u2019t all freelancers want true success?*","a8b2ff19":"## **The Clients - Choosing a Boss**\n\nArguably, the most essential part of freelancing is the clients. It doesn't matter how good your skills are without someone who will pay you to use them. This section will cover clients, aiming to assess freelancer views on client numbers and client interaction.","6acd651b":"*Not having a strategy is close to business suicide. How else would you plan to stay competitive as the world changes constantly?*\n\nMost respondents are looking to learn more about branding, marketing and sales. This desire is understandable, you need to build your skills to earn higher rates, but you also need the marketing know-how to advertise those skills to clients.","e1f0758f":"*An alerting number of 35% of freelancers didn\u2019t have ANY SAVINGS to cover their living expenses when they started #freelancing! But fortunately, 47% say they had savings enough for the recommended period of at least 4-6 months or even more. Dudes, EVERY BUSINESS needs an initial capital. In the case of freelance businesses, it can be very small, though.*","34886168":"Personally, I've never had to join any organizations or work with sales partners to help get more business. That being said, I know that many people struggle with finding clients at first, so I can see why they'd perhaps try a different approach at times.\n\n*I find it very interesting that some manage their sales without interfacing with the client directly!*","764a8017":"Sorry Mikko, it looks like #coconuts hasn't taken off just yet!","1051f152":"I'm stunned to see that a whopping 50% of respondents have complete trust in their favorite freelance site; it takes a lot to have full confidence that your primary source of income won't hang you out to dry under certain circumstances. The general consensus that I've seen is that it's best to diversify your income sources. That way, if one website cuts you off for whatever reason, you've got a backup plan in place.","fb44e8f7":"## **The Journey - From Beginner to Veteran**\n\nEvery business needs a plan to be successful; this includes freelance businesses too! One particular area which should be near the forefront of every freelancer's business plan is growth. If you're not landing those big-ticket clients just yet, that's ok, but you should have a roadmap for how to get there. Alternatively, maybe you're already one of those big fish that Mikko mentioned in the previous section, but if you'd like to stay on top, you still need a growth plan to keep on top of the latest technologies. So whether you're a beginner wondering how to get started in the world of freelancing or if you're someone more experienced that wants to get to the next level, then you may find this section pretty helpful.","fbaa4a2a":"*I would encourage people to be the BIG FISH in whatever pond they choose. Be the Go-To who nearly owns a niche or two, particularly, if you do things online. The world is big enough for a one-person business to work on a very specific niche. Also, that is by far the best way to start on freelance sites.*","89df05be":"Freelancing is the same as most things in life because what you get out of it is equivalent to what you put in. As a result, the amount of time it takes to start bringing in an adequate income is directly related to how much hard work you're willing to put into building your reputation and your portfolio.\n\n*I think change is good just for keeping things interesting, if for no other reason.*","27015fd5":"## **The Marketing - Generating Leads for a Freelance Business**\n\nYou could be the most talented data analyst, graphic designer or copywriter out there, but it doesn't matter if you can't land a gig. Marketing is one of the most critical areas of freelancing, so read on to see what some of our respondents had to say about how they go about hunting for leads.","d571705b":"*57% plan to freelance for life! Supposedly, they are those who have got things going very sweet, are perhaps based out of an island of #coconuts, sipping drinks on a beach while working, etc. That is a VERY NICE PERCENTAGE!*\n\nBuilding upon my previous point about the effect that COVID-19 has had on freelancers, it's also no shock to see that most respondents believe it's better to build a freelance business online. The pandemic has shown employers that you don't need someone to be physically sat in the same building to get results. For freelancers, this is excellent news as it opens up a global marketplace of opportunities.","7188ac8d":"*Hmm\u2026 would it not be too much like having a boss after all? I personally get exhausted in long-term projects if they start to repeat anything I could call a routine. I learn nothing new from routines.*","a1dc91cf":"I'm shocked to see that approximately 35% of respondents have never fired a client. Personally, I fall into the 'Yes, just once' column on this one and I believe it isn't a decision to be taken lightly, but sometimes a client just has to go! Perhaps some freelancers are just luckier than others with their clients?\n\n*Firing freelancers is a sadly common phenomenon, but it works the other way round also. 20% of the freelancers report having FIRED A CLIENT once. 37% say they\u2019ve done it several times! Way to go, guys!*","b58bc9b7":"Likely, these results are highly correlated to the types of jobs that freelancers do. Some gigs just don't require more than one pair of hands to take care of, so, understandably, many freelancers don't require collaborators or subcontractors."}}
