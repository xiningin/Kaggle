make assumptions and prove them later. Also, the fact that this plot is for all languages and all the 1000 channles combined makes it hard to visualise.\n\nWe can make an assumption that the correlation between Followers and Stream Time is really less atleast when accounting for all languages combined.\n\nWe can assume that more Stream Time usually means less followers,since we can see from the plot that from 200000 minutes of Stream Time, the followers decreased slightly which could probably mean slight negative correlation. We can check this soon. \n\nThe point that seemed like a outlier to me is the point which represnts almost 8000000 followers but the stream time is in between 0 to 100000 stream time because the other channels in this range usually have 4 times less followers than this particluar channel.\n\nLets compare this channel with a similar channel to see if we can find any interesting information at the end","acd3f4d3":"Lets see the plot with Maturity as a hue to find some insights.","a259b64c":"This English channel named TimTheTatman is the most popular mature channel out there. It has a fairly impressive Watch Time of 2834436990 minutes with 5265659 people following his account.

This plot is more equally distributed than the Watch time column against other languages. We can clearly see that the stream time in all languages are kinda equally spread from 0 to 200000 minutes. From there, there are really few channels whose stream time has exceeded 200000 minutes. \n\n2. Japanese channels are the most striking ones because of the fact that there are a very few channels in th language and none of their stream time is not overlapping in the least.\n\n3. English has the most number of channels which has their stream time more than 500000 minutes while 4 other languages have one channel exceeding 500000 minutes stream time (It will be interesting to see their reach compared to similar english channels)\n\nLets move on now.","038b6298":"We can clearly see that the Stream Time overall is slightly negatively correlated with number of followers as a whole.","e1725d58":"Inferences:- \n\nThis plot has some interesting characterstics which are quite obvious after seeing the plot. A major cluster of the total 77 odd channels have their total watch time under 0.5le9 minutes which a few exceeded that watch time. As the watch time increased, we can see a small growth in followers too barring 2 anamolies.\n\nOne particluar channel, even though has watch time in the range of 0.5 to 1 like others, had the followers count more than any other channel while the channel having watch time more than 2 has less followers. Lets take a look at these channels to see if we can find something.","bed2ea25":"## Now lets move onto Outlier detection and Cleaning after which we can create a target column ","513bf558":"## If you did like my analysis of this paarticular dataset, please drop a like and send some suggestions in the comments section","9630deef":"This....is a rather interesting plot. Lets dive deeper into this plot to see what we can find.\n\nThe first thing we observe is that there is one extreme outlier point whose Stream Time is quite less compared to all other channels but it has the highest number of followers which doesn't sound quite good.This might be the case of a celebrity posting less content but has highest followers.\n\nComing to the rest of the plot, we can see that there's almost 0 correlation as the number of followers are being constant irrespective of the Stream Time ranging from 0 to highest value. Infact, the highest Stream Time channel has the lowest number of followers. Really Strange","8b2a8efc":"Now, let's once again take the languages of Korean,English and Japanese to see how the Stream Time affects the followers based on these specific languages","2c749bdb":"Let us look at few of the most popular languages to see if their watch times and followers are correlated. \n\nI'm taking English, Korean and Japanese as example.","a55b6c6c":"Now let us compare the above plot with the plot between Language of Channels and Stream Time","0c0926c6":"We can see that the Stream Time has -2% negative correlation with Followers in Japanese compared to the -10% correlation overall.","048cc191":"### We can observe that Peak viewers has a correlation of 58% with watch time while Average Viewers has correlation of 47%","ffb77afd":"## The End","0a04979d":"Inferences :-\n    \nSince, there are quite less number of channels in Japnese, we can clearly see the contrast between each channel which is not possible for English.\n\nAs a whole, we can see that the Stream Time is slightly less negatively correlated in the case of Japanese language wherein as the Stream Time increases, the number of followers increased too (except for some outliers) which is quite opposite to the negative correlation displayed as a whole.","afb8155e":"# Creating the Target Column","649aee0c":"### Now lets move on to the followers column to analyse it before moving on to creating a target column and making some predictions","4d9bccd0":"From this, we can observe that\n\n1.

Next we obtain the InterQuartile Range or iqr by subtracting these two quartiles followed by calculating the lower and upper bounds by using a formula.\n\nOnce we get a hold of the Lower Bound and Upper Bound values, any data point which is less than the Lower bound and higher than the Upper Bound is an outlier so we remove them to balance the data","84d1229c":"The Japanese channels seem stable with respect to the number of followers they have based on their watch time of their videos.

Its hard to visualise the impact of English language on Watch time and Followers but we saw earlier in other plots that it has the largest watch time of all languages and even in this plot compared to the previous plot, we can see a large portion of graph is English itself.

This can imply that the viewers of these particluar channels are limited in number\n\nEven though the stream time of Korean Channels are quite varying, except for some channels, the watch time is almost close to one another.
