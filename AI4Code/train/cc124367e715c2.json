If you plan to not use Jupyter Notebooks or any other programming language, please see our [Github](https:\/\/github.com\/Lux-AI-Challenge\/Lux-Design-2021). The following are some important links!\n\nCompetition Page: https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/lux-ai-2021\/\n\nOnline Visualizer: https:\/\/2021vis.lux-ai.org\/\n\nSpecifications: https:\/\/www.lux-ai.org\/specs-2021\n\nGithub: https:\/\/github.com\/Lux-AI-Challenge\/Lux-Design-2021\n\nBot API: https:\/\/github.com\/Lux-AI-Challenge\/Lux-Design-2021\/tree\/master\/kits\n\nAnd if you haven't done so already, we highly recommend you join our Discord server at https:\/\/discord.gg\/aWJt3UAcgn or at the minimum follow the kaggle forums at https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/lux-ai-2021\/discussion. We post important announcements there such as changes to rules, events, and opportunities from our sponsors!","344a0cce":"## Create a submission\nNow we need to create a .tar.gz file with main.py (and agent.py) at the top level. We can then upload this!","ebed99d2":"## CLI Tool\n\nThere's a separate CLI tool that can also be used to run matches. It's recommended for Jupyter Notebook users to stick with just this quickstart notebook, and all other users including python users to follow the instructions on https:\/\/github.com\/Lux-AI-Challenge\/Lux-Design-2021\n\nThe other benefit however of using the CLI tool is that it generates much smaller, \"stateless\" replays and also lets you run a mini leaderboard on multiple bots ranked by various ranking algorithms","faa41ca1":"## Submit\nNow open the \/kaggle\/working folder and find submission.tar.gz, download that file, navigate to the \"MySubmissions\" tab in https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/lux-ai-2021\/ and upload your submission! It should play a validation match against itself and once it succeeds it will be automatically matched against other players' submissions. Newer submissions will be prioritized for games over older ones. Your team is limited in the number of succesful submissions per day so we highly recommend testing your bot locally before submitting.","855551c0":"## Additional things to check out\n\nMake sure you check out the Bot API at https:\/\/github.com\/Lux-AI-Challenge\/Lux-Design-2021\/tree\/master\/kits\n\nThis documents what you can do using the starter kit files in addition to telling you how to use the annotation debug commands that let you annotate directly on a replay (draw lines, circle things etc.)\n\nYou can upload repaly files like the JSON file created earlier to the online replay viewer https:\/\/2021vis.lux-ai.org\/\n\nFor a local (faster) version of the replay viewer, follow installation instructions here https:\/\/github.com\/Lux-AI-Challenge\/Lux-Viewer-2021"}}
