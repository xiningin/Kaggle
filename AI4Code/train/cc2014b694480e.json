Was your idea too easy? Too hard? Just right?\n* If you had unlimited time, what would you add to this project?","f1828404":"## Project Instructions\nWrite a program that asks the user for categories. For each category, ask the user for a number of things in that category. You should print something for each category that states the category and the three things in that category.\n\nHere is what running your final program should look like:\n\n```\nWould you like to do another category? Yes\nEnter a category: animals\nHow many would you like to list? 3\nEnter something in that category: cheetah\nEnter something in that category: pelican\nEnter something in that category: red panda\nanimals: cheetah pelican red panda\n\nWould you like to do another category? Yes\nHow many would you like to list? 3\nEnter a category: noises\nEnter something in that category: vroom!\nEnter something in that category: whirrr!\nEnter something in that category: whooosh!\nnoises: vroom! whirrr! whooosh!\n\nWould you like to do another category? Yes\nHow many would you like to list? 2\nEnter a category: programming languages\nEnter something in that category: Python\nEnter something in that category: Java\nprogramming languages: Python Java\n\nWould you like to do another category? No\n```\n\nNote: You will need to use NESTED control structures\n\nWant to make it better?\n* Use Python output formatting tools\n* Add functionality that allows users to put in an element, and the program responds with which category it is in.\n* Anything else!","52083142":"# Make a Plan"}}
