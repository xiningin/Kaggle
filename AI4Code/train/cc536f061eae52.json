Entree were crab and pork, both amazing dishes full of flavor. I understand what others have said in their reviews re: portion size, however; the skill involved in making these dishes deserves somebody to savour it and not rush it. Mains were the wagyu, and the lamb. Despite both being meat dishes, I couldn't say which one I liked more despite trying both as they were so different. Full of flavours, expertly cooked. The wagyu was tender and the flavours amazing, the lamb was perfect and all the accompaniments were expertly suited. Dessert was a chocolate mousse, you only need a little bit because it's so rich. The whole experience was amazing. A special mention to Ashe who had the most amazing\/funny\/professional table manner when serving, he's a true asset to the establishment. Unfortunately cash flow has been tight this month for good reasons, but it meant we weren't able to tip after receiving the bill. Despite this, we hope to return again and will make up for our evening last night on our next visit.\"\"\"\nthree_star_review = \"\"\"We had heard good things about this place, but it has let us down twice. The first time it was busy and we gave up waiting for service after about 20 minutes. So, yesterday we tried again with 6 friends who were visiting the 'Mountains.' Sadly, the waiter seemed unaware of almost anything on the menu, got four orders wrong and failed to even place one order at all! He then went home and another server had to deal with the mistakes. Four of us were disappointed with the food and the other four thought it was just okay. The location is great but this cafe needs a real shake-up.\"\"\"\none_star_review = \"\"\"The location was spectacular, the fireplace created a beautiful ambiance on a winters day. However the food was a lot to be desired. My friend had been previously with her husband and enjoyed the meals, however what we got was disgusting! We ordered sausages from the local butcher with polenta....well Coles cheap beef sausages are a lot tastier and moist, they looked like they boiled them and put them on a plate, absolutely no grill marks, the polenta was so dry I gagged. My other friend ordered their homemade pie that was stuck in a microwave oven to be heated and ended with soggy pastry. Sorry but definitely need someone new in the kitchen. The staff, well the first lady that took us to our table was lovely, but the second person we ordered our coffees with was so upset that we were going to delay her from leaving work on time.
