A well-known color constancy method is based on the gray-world assumption which assumes that the average reflectance of surfaces in the world is achromatic. In this paper, we propose a new hypothesis for color constancy namely the gray-edge hypothesis, which assumes that the average edge difference in a scene is achromatic. Based on this hypothesis, we propose an algorithm for color constancy. Contrary to existing color constancy algorithms, which are computed from the zero-order structure of images, our method is based on the derivative structure of images. Furthermore, we propose a framework which unifies a variety of known (gray-world, max-RGB, Minkowski norm) and the newly proposed gray-edge and higher order gray-edge algorithms. The quality of the various instantiations of the framework is tested and compared to the state-of-the-art color constancy methods on two large data sets of images recording objects under a large number of different light sources. The experiments show that the proposed color constancy algorithms obtain comparable results as the state-of-the-art color constancy methods with the merit of being computationally more efficient.","4ae5eba7":"# Lets begin remembering how GANs work:\n\nThe idea behind GANs is that you have two networks, a generator $G$ and a discriminator $D$, competing against each other. The generator makes \"fake\" data to pass to the discriminator. The discriminator also sees real training data and predicts if the data it's received is real or fake.\n\nThe generator is trained to fool the discriminator, it wants to output data that looks as close as possible to real, training data.\nThe discriminator is a classifier that is trained to figure out which data is real and which is fake.\nWhat ends up happening is that the generator learns to make data that is indistinguishable from real data to the discriminator.\n\n![](https:\/\/i.ibb.co\/jkZPNyz\/ref.png)\n\nThe general structure of the GAN that we are using here is shown in the diagram above. The latent sample is a random vector that the generator uses to construct its fake images. This is often called a latent vector and that vector space is called latent space. As the generator trains, it figures out how to map latent vectors to recognizable images that can fool the discriminator.\n\nOnce the generator has trained, we can throw out the discriminator after we are done with training.
