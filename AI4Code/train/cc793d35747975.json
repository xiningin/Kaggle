If treated so, then Under the hypothesis that all the random variables $X_1,...,X_n$ have the same distribution $\\mathbb{F}_X (x)$, the expected value of $\\mathbb{F}_n (x)$ is $\\mathbb{F}_X (x)$.\nFurthermore if $X_1, X_2, ..., X_n$ are mutually independent then $var(\\mathbb{F}_n (x)=\\frac{1}{n} F_X (x) [1-F_X (x)]$\n\n3) As a consequence of Note 2, we get that for large samples the empirical distribution converges in mean-square to the true distribution function.
