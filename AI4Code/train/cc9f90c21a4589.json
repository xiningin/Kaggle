It is designed to be compatible with many existing CPU tools, such as Pandas, scikit-learn, numpy, etc. It enables **massive** acceleration of many data-science and machine learning tasks, oftentimes by a factor fo 100X, or even more. \n\nRapids is still undergoing developemnt, and as of right now it's not availabel in the Kaggle Docker environment. If you are interested in installing and riunning Rapids locally on your own machine, then you shoudl [refer to the followong instructions](https:\/\/rapids.ai\/start.html).\n\nThe first successful install of a Rapids library on kaggle was done by [Chris Deotte](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/cdeotte) in the follwiong [Digit Recognizer kernel](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/cdeotte\/rapids-gpu-knn-mnist-0-97). An improved install version that uses a Kaggle Dataset for install can be found [here](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/cdeotte\/rapids-data-augmentation-mnist-0-985).  In this kerenl we'll follow that approach.\n\nThe purpose of this kernel is to showcase the speedup that one gets with t-SNE algorithm between the SKLEARN version and the Rapids version. The Sklearn version can be found [here](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/tunguz\/mnist-2d-t-sne)","e1e93aff":"So we get five seconds instead of three hours! That's a really substantial speedup. A speedup of over 2000X in Kaggle Kernels!\n\nNow let's visualize to see what the output looks like. We'll have to retrain t-SNE on train features only, because we want to see how the embeddings correspond to different digits. ","21c295ce":"Various colors corrrespond to various digits. We see that same digits are fairly well clustered together, which is probably one of the main reasons why this problem is relatively easy for ML models to do. "}}
