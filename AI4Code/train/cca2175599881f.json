The fare prices often included train tickets to the ports of embarkation, but were based mainly on a certain base price for each class of passengers. There is greatest variability among the fares for the first class passengers, some of whom paid for additional accomodations like balconies and so on. There is only one of missing fare and because the passenger missing his fare is from the third class, we will simply impute this from the rest of the fare information from the third class. ","0d25cc0a":"There are very few features in this model, so its unlikely that removing any will improve the model. On the other hand, the fare column is, as previously mentioned, merely a function of what class the passenger belongs to plus additional prices for train rides to the point of embarkation. It seems odd that this column contributes about as much to the model as the passenger class does. We attempt therefore to build the model without the fare data. ","602c5454":"As it turns out, this is not quite right. There are 67 passengers in first class who have a missing value for `Cabin`.  Moreover, there are 23 passengers in second class and 16 passengers in third class with a Cabin assigned. Note here that should we choose to impute the information in this column, we would be filling in about 3\/4ths (well 1014\/1309, to be precise) of the data in this column.

The `Embarked` column, which tells us which port the passenger embarked on the Titanic, has only two missing entries. More interesting is `Cabin`, which has 1014 (out of 1309) missing entries.
