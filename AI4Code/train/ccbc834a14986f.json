Zooming in gives you a better visualization of the individual streets, and you'll notice some streets have more redspots than others; that indicates those streets have more collisions than others. Given the information I know, this heatmap doesn't tell me a whole lot as certain roads may have more accidents because they just have more traffic. If someone more familiar with the actual streets of Denver knows a particular intersection is ill-designed, this visualization could provide that person with supporting evidence. Combined with other traffic datasets, more meaningful conclusions can be drawn.","63408b48":"The above graph breaks down the all-other-crimes category and shows how those crimes trended over the years. of note is that criminal trespassing is trending upwards, which may be expected given Denver's constantly increasing population.","9eac1b41":"Some offense codes have multiple extensions as indicated by the blank spaces in the OFFENSE_CODE column, but every offense code and extension pair has exactly one offense type id.

First and formost, it seems like most crimes occur betwwen 8 AM and 8 PM with a noticeable dip in crime from 1 AM to 5 AM. Different types of crimes seem to be prevalent at different times of the day. aggravated-assualt, robbery, and other-crimes-against-persons seem to be most common late at night, betwen 10 PM and 2 AM. Auto-theft, theft-from-notor-vehicle, and larceny seem to be most common from 9 AM to 5 PM, which is also when people are at work. Since thefts have increased significantly over the past five years, reminding people to lock their cars and possessions before going to work may help address some of this crime. the crimes of murder and arson are too infrequent to come up with a meaningful trend statement.","b934024e":"Based on the above output, many of the columns have identical numbers of non-null data. this suggests that the places with null values were left so intentionally. Upon further investigation, it seems that the geographical locations are smetimes left null for privacy reasons and the Last Reported Date column is sometimes left null because the crime occurred at a known time. There don't to be any truly missing values in the dataset, which is good news\n","4aca9c72":"<font size=3><b>Appendix<\/b><\/font>\n\nIn this section, I'm including a handful of graphs that I couldn't fit into the report, but still found interesting and may turn out useful","19ae08f2":"<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<font size=3><b>Preliminary Analysis<\/b><\/font>\n\nNow that the data's been primed, I will begin my analysis. To start, I'll get a general overview of Denver's crime trend over the past few years. For the record, I'll be using the REPORTED_DATE to timestamp all crimes since that is when the crime comes to a police department's attention.\n<br>","fceaa245":"This distribution shows how crimes break down by type within each district. the data is organized differently from the district graphs earlier in the report, but they contain the same information. This orginization may be more useful to the individual police departments though; they may want a graph showcasing the crime trends in their district only.","c7d66ba8":"Next let's take a look at what types of crimes are being committed in Denver.","81e590ec":"other-crimes-against-persons seem to primarily composed of assualts, with a bit of spying and flashing mxed in. Given it's composition, this category will be most influenced by the number of assualts within it, so I'd personally consider the category elated to aggravated-assualt.","80e7d570":"<br>\nThere are a total of 19 columns in this dataset. I reached out to the city of Denver and received clarification on several of the columns. I will briefly describe each column below. I will go slightly out of order to provide a more cohesive explanation\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>OFFENSE_ID<\/b> is a unique identifier for each offense. It is generated by concatanating (combining) the INCIDENT_ID, OFFENSE_CODE,and OFFENSE_CODE_EXTENSION. It provides a unique identifier for each offense, as the INCIDENT_ID is duplicated if multiple offenses are committed at once, and OFFENSE_CODE and OFFENSE_CODE_EXTENSION will repeat whenever a particular type of offense is committed\n\n<b>INCIDENT_ID<\/b> is a unique identifier for an occurence of offenses. most OFFENSE_ID's have unique INCIDENT_ID's, but when a person commits multiple offenses at once, e.g. liquor possession and heroine possession, multiple OFFENSE_ID's will be generated from the INCIDENT_ID\n\n<b>OFFENSE_CODE<\/b> is a unique identifier for a particular type of offense. things such as criminal mischief, trespassing, larceny, etc. all have different OFFENSE__CODE values to identify them\n\n<b>OFFENSE_CODE_EXTENSION<\/b> are used to describe a subset of another type crime. for example criminal_mischief- motor vehicle and criminal_mischief-other have the same OFFENSE_CODE but different extensions to differentiate them\n\n<b>OFFENSE_TYPE_ID<\/b> provides the actual name for the offense in lamens terms. each combination of OFFENSE_CODE and OFFENSE_EXTENSION reference a unique crime. contents of this column include things such as theft-shoplift, criminal-trespassing, and threats-to-injure\n\n<b>OFFENSE_CATEGORY_ID<\/b> provides a more general categorization for crimes. for example, theft-shoplift and theft-from-bldg are both forms of larceny\n\n<b>FIRST_OCCURENCE_DATE<\/b> is the first possible date\/time of the offense. if the time of the offense is known, the LAST_OCCURENCE_DATE will have value NaN. if the time is not known, FIRST_OCCURENCE_DATE will note the first possible time for the offense, and LAST_OCCURENCE_DATE will be last possible time of the offense. This commonly occurs with burglaries, where the exact time of the offense may not be known, but a range of time is known\n\n<b>LAST_OCCURENCE_DATE<\/b> will be NaN if the exact time of the offense is known and will be an actual time if only a range of possible times is known. in the latter case, it will be the last possible time the offense could have occured.\n\n<b>REPORTED_DATE<\/b> is the time at which the offense was reported to the police\n\n<b>INCIDENT_ADDRESS<\/b> provides the location of the offense. not all entries have a value for this column for privacy reasons\n\n<b>GEO_LON<\/b> and <b>GEO_LAT<\/b> are the latitudes and longitudes of the location of the offense\n\n<b>GEO_X<\/b> and <b>GEO_Y<\/b> are the state plane (city of Denver standard projection) for the offense location. functionally simlar to GEO_LON and GEO_LAT\n\n<b>DISTRICT_ID<\/b> is the district in charge of handling the offense\n\n<b>PRECINCT_ID<\/b> is the precinct in charge of handling the offense\n\n<b>NEIGHBORHOOD_ID<\/b> is the neighborhood the offense occurred in\n\n<b>IS_CRIME<\/b> states whether the offense was a crime\n\n<b>IS_TRAFFIC<\/b> states whether the offense was a traffic incident\n\n\n","aedc01be":"<font colors=black, size='5'> Analyzing Denver's Crime Data<\/font>\n\n### Neil Oza\n<\/font>\n\n","b8d0d46b":"<font size=3><b> Crimes Viewed through Various Timeframes<\/b><\/font>\n\nNow that I have an overview of the data, I'll begin looking at the data through various time frames. Specifically, I want to see if crimes are seasonal and if certain types of crimes have become more common over time. Let's start by breaking down each type of crime over the last five years.","ed81998a":"Districts 6, 3, and 1 are the largest, while district 7 is the smallest by a large margin. Crime seems to be trending upward over time in every district wih the exception of district 4 and possibly district 2, though in the latter case the data isn't conclusive.\n\nNext let's take a look at the prevalence of different types of crimes in each district. We would expect those distributions to be similar to the above distribution. If that turns out not to be the case it would suggest that the crime is dispraportionately represented in that district.","52d7f3b8":"In this final section, I will generate some heatmps to help visualize the physical locations of crimes in Denver. In addition, I will create a function that will let you generate your own heatmaps as you see fit! I will first create the function I use to generate the heatmaps, then create several heatmaps myself, and then convey how you could create your own heatmaps!"}}
