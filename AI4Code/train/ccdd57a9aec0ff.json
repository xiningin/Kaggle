","99b5643e":"I opted to extract from the data paragraphs from the text. This is a common approach in handling large documents, not just for compute but also as we assume that each paragraph contains some idea which addresses a research question which a researcher may be looking for.  Splitting the articles into paragraph also prevents documents mapping to too many topics, as an article may address many research ideas and as a result may make estimation of its topic challenging.  This is also true for Word-vector-level Document Embeddings where averageing over too many words can render embeddings uninformative as they tend to the corpus mean. ","54a8d4f8":"While Document Embeddings provide a valuable extension to the word2vec algorithm, many practitioners opt to aggregate word vectors in order to represent documents.

Using this Dataset is may be difficult to brainstorm how best to extract value from this Dataset for those in Biomedical Research.  The three main objectives I see many taking on in this competition may be document summarization, indexing, question-answer and possible in topic modelling to better navigate the state of research and where possible gaps exist in the literature.  \n  \nIts been a while since last I worked on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and it has been amazing to see how far the tooling and methodologies have developed.  The main aim of this notebook is to create an easy to follow structure exploring some techniques for those unfamiliar with NLP and to provide easy to use and integrate pipeline for people to extend on in other work.  \n\nKaggle and their partners must really be commended for compiling a data of such high quality in as short a time-frame as they have.  I have no doubt this will not just keep Data Hobbyist occupied during this time, but also provide valuable insights to researchers hoping to extract value from this corpus. \n\nThe two main methodologies I aimed to focus on where Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Document Embedding.  Using these approaches, I aimed to explore the structure of ongoing research to get a sense of how spread research interests appear at the current moment. For visualization, I opted to explore the use of UMAP to learn a 2D embedding from these Topic Probabilities and Document Vectors to map from their original space of varying density to a lower-dimensional space of uniform density so exploratory clustering could be performed using DBSCAN.  The pipeline of using TSNE\/UMAP with DBSCAN is a common pattern in Data Science pipeline as DBSCAN relies on the assumption that clusters have a similar density in order to threshold on eps.  It is also a common pattern for exploratory analysis as it a method by which to easily discover an appropriate number of cluster in the data, provided your hyperparameters are set sensible and visualize complex high dimensional data which may lie on some manifold.

What may be interesting to investigate is whether our smaller cluster represents a true cluster in the data or whether it represent some artefact such as a disclaimer or copyright used in these articles.

","7f569f7a":"Document Vectors are learning using negative sampling by comparing a documents vector to proposed learned word vectors which may or may not appear in its text.  This negative sampling trick is the magic behind word2vec and any2vec algorithms and makes for fast and scalable non-contextual word-vector embeddings. Using this approach, we aim to learn embeddings for our paragraph, which we may again embed into a 2D space using UMAP using the cosine angles between these vectors and cluster using DBSCAN. "}}
