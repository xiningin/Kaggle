This means we cannot estimate how nervous\/anxious\/on edge someone is feeling based on how their number of working hours have changed. **This means that it would be difficult to know if a mental health initiative created specifically for individuals whose working hours have changed had an influence on their feelings of nervousness\/anxiety and therefore may not be worth pursuing as a mental health initiative.**\n\nThe survey responses that had the highest associations were those asking about the frequency of feelings associated with anxiety. This means that, for example, feelings of not being able to control worrying were moderately associated with having trouble relaxing. Considering that each of these particular questions were related to feelings of anxiety, it isn't surprising that there is an association between their responses. We also see small to moderate associations for the responses to the multiple questions related to depression. Associations like these likely aren't very helpful in creating targeted mental health initiatives or modifying current initiatives so they better suit individuals with needs that have arose as a result of the pandemic since the feelings of anxiety and\/or depression aren't associated with any life changes that arose due to the pandemic.\n\n## Comparison of Survey Responses based on Province\nAs of June 24, the three provinces with the highest number of total cases were Quebec (>54,000 total cases), Ontario (>34,000), and Alberta (>7000). Note that these are raw counts and do not account for the proportion of people living in each of these provinces. Despite this, the responses to the survey questions and the mental health needs of people living in these provinces may differ compared to when the entire country is considered. To investigate this further, visualizations of the proportions of the possible responses for the following questions for Quebec, Ontario, Alberta, and Canada-wide were created:\n\n- Q5 : How worried are you about the impact of COVID-19 on your personal financial situation?\n- Q7 : How worried are you that you or someone close to you (close relative or friend) will get ill from COVID-19?\n- Q8x1 : P2W frequency - Feeling nervous, anxious or on edge\n- Q20x1 : In the PAST 7 DAYS, how often have you felt depressed?\n- Q20x3 : In the PAST 7 DAYS, how often have you felt hopeful about the future?\n\n\n","4d04f4ee":"We can see there are questions related to **personal exposure\/experience with the virus itself**, **employment**, **mood**, **alcohol and cannabis consumption**, **living situation**, as well as **education and income**.

To investigate this further, the same confidence interval exercise described above (for the responses from the participants living in different provinces) was completed for these two groups (living with kids, living without kids). The same five survey questions as those considered in the investigation of the provinces are considered here. Unlike the immediately previous section, plots have been omitted.","12b0bcfb":"These confidence intervals indicate that there is a significantly greater proportion of negative survey responses from those living without children for two of the five survey questions considered. **This suggests that people living without children may benefit from targeted mental health services.**\n\n# Conclusions\nThis notebook used survey data from CAMH and Delvinia to identify associations between Canadians' moods\/feelings of depression and anxiety and changes to their everyday lives as a result of the pandemic. The associations were weak, suggesting that it would be difficult to tell if mental health initiatives specifically targeted to individuals experiencing specific life changes (for example, a reduced number of paid working hours) have any impact on their mental health. This notebook also used the survey data to determine if the feelings\/needs regarding mental health varied across provinces, with consideration given to the three provinces with the most confirmed COVID-19 cases. No significant differences were found between provinces with regards to the number of most negative responses to five of the survey questions, suggesting that the offering of mental health services can be equally prioritized country-wide, regardless that some provinces have many more confirmed cases than others. There was a significant difference between participants living with children and participants living without children with regards to the proportion of most negative responses for two of the survey questions, suggesting that adults living without children may benefit from targeted mental health initiatives.\n\n\n# Limitations and Other Considerations\nA limitation of this notebook is that the survey didn't include questions about whether the participant was using\/seeking mental health resources prior to the pandemic so it is difficult to evaluate how mental health challenges have shifted since the start of the pandemic; the only data we can compare to is the first round of the survey responses (not included in this notebook). Also, at the time of these surveys, aids such as CERB had already been made available to Canadians. The responses to the survey questions may have been different if the survey were released prior to when these aids were made available. It would be interesting to compare the responses between these times (pre-CERB and post-CERB, for example) and see how mental health challenges had shifted in this short time period. The survey was also not exhaustive in that no questions that could shed some light on why people were feeling depressed\/anxious at the time of survey completion were included (for example, abuse in the home, not being able to physically meet with people outside of the household, etc.). However, it is acknowledged that events related to the pandemic happened very quickly and that people are more likely to complete a survey with as few questions as possible compared to a more extensive survey; given the circumstances, the results give us an idea of shifts in mental health in Canada throughout the pandemic.\n\nA final limitation is that the analysis presented in this notebook is by no means exhaustive. While I tried my best to present new information and not just repeat the summary report created by CAMH\/Delvinia, there is opportunity for more analyses. Now that this dataset is in the Kaggle community, I hope more insight and investigation regarding shifts in mental health throughout the pandemic comes of this. \n\n\n# Acknowledgments\nThanks to CAMH\/Delvinia for collecting the survey data and making it available to the public.

The data used are survey data from two surveys released by CAMH and Delvinia. The purpose of this notebook isn't to reiterate the conclusions provided by CAMH\/Delvinia (found [here](https:\/\/www.camh.ca\/en\/health-info\/mental-health-and-covid-19\/covid-19-national-survey)) but is instead intended to identify any correlations and differences across provinces among the answers to the different survey questions to better design and target mental health services in Canada. How the task criteria has been addressed is as follows:\n\n1.Scientific rigor: the data used are survey data from two surveys released by CAMH and Delvinia. For both surveys, over 1000 Canadians submitted responses.\n\n2.Scientific model\/strategy: the **uncertainty coefficient** was used to quantify associations between categorical responses to survey questions. **95% confidence intervals for difference in proportions** were used to determine if there were any differences in responses between participants living in different provinces, including those with the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases. 95% confidence intervals for difference in proportions were used to determine if there were any differences in responses between participants living with children and participants living without children.\n\n3.Unique and novel insight: this is the first Kaggle notebook that makes use of the CAMH\/Delvinia data (to the best of the author's knowledge). New information (i.e. different from what was presented by CAMH\/Delvinia) is presented in this notebook - see point number 2.\n\n4.Market translation and applicability: this notebook uses a data-driven approach to determine whether certain individuals\/populations among Canada should have specific mental health services\/initiatives targeted towards them.\n\n7.Ability of user to collaborate and contribute to other solutions within the Kaggle community: prior to this notebook, the CAMH\/Delvinia survey data was not on Kaggle.","4edcc40e":"# Survey 2 Results\nSurvey 1 took place from May 8-12, survey 2 took place from May 29-Jun 1. To see differences in survey response questions between the two survey periods, please see the [survey summary dashboard](https:\/\/www.camh.ca\/en\/health-info\/mental-health-and-covid-19\/covid-19-national-survey). The results from survey 2 will be considered here since they are the most up-to-date results.\n## Data Overview\nTo understand who completed the survey, let's load the data and see the survey questions. The questions and participants were the same for both surveys.","8765ff26":"Approx. 99% of survey participants identified as being either a woman or a man, 70% stated they were white (European, North American), and 56% were living in either Ontario or British Columbia at the time of survey completion.\n\n## Correlations Between Employment\/Finances, Mood, and Living Situation (Canada-wide)\nSince some of the survey questions have categorical rather than numerical responses, we can't use tools like Pearson's R to quantify correlations between the responses to the survey questions. Instead, we can use the **Uncertainty Coefficient**. The Uncertainty Coefficient is the degree of association between two categorical variables, x and y, and is a value between 0 and 1 (0 meaning that feature y provides no information about feature x's value, 1 meaning that feature y provides full information about feature x's value). Associations between the responses to some of the categorical-response questions can be seen below. These associations use all data from survey 2.\n","2563c54d":"To better understand these plots, consider the last plot (*Responses - how often have you felt hopeful about the future (past 7 days)*). About 3% of participants from Quebec responded \"Most of the time\", between 40-45% responded \"Occasionally\", a little less than 20% responded \"Rarely\", and over 30% responded \"Sometimes\".\n\nAlthough it is best to have a proactive\/preventative approach to any health treatment, considering that for each of these questions there was more than one response for the most negative possible answers, treating individuals who had these responses should be prioritized. For example, considering the last question, those who responded \"rarely\" and \"sometimes\" should be addressed before those who responded \"occasionally\" or \"most of the time\". To take it one step further, within those responses to the most negative possible answer, the province that had the greatest proportion of these responses should be prioritized. To determine if there was a statistically significant difference between the proportions of the most negative responses across the the three provinces and the country as a whole, 95% confidence intervals for a difference in proportions were computed as seen below. From these confidence intervals, a decision at a confidence level of 95% could be made as to whether the proportions of participants that responded most negatively to the survey questions under consideration were the same. These decisions are also provided below."}}
