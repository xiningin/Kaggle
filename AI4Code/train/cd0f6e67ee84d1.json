We would have to investigate. Now, let's look at the big outlier in the 'Maisonneuve_3' lane.","b3ec91fe":"We notice some outliers. Some really high values out of nowhere and some lanes that it's range of values don't include low values, meaning they should have regular activity throughout the whole year (like Saint-Laurent U-Zelt Test). That seems odd so let's take a closer look at those cases.","357967ca":"Let's filter that specific event ","5179e079":"We can see the rise of activity in the warmer months of the year. Montreal is a cold city!. Let's try now to plot all of the lanes together and add a legend to the plot.","80ad21c4":"So, it looks like either there was a massive event, like a race of some sort, or some sort of technical problem. We would have to investigate that too, but for now let's get ride of that lane, and of all the lanes that contain missing values, and move on with our overview.","f0416f4b":"We can't really get much information from this graph. Let's see if we can get better insights by using a boxplot.","850d2ea6":"As we could have guessed from the name, this lane seems to be undergoing a test so it only has activity recorded since the end of September.
