Any inputs regarding the same would be most welcome.","61e5f30a":"Hello, everyone.\nI had hosted a few kaggle InClass competitions for the Machine Learning course in my university. While grading, I needed the results of the private leaderboard. \nHowever, kaggle directly allowed me to only get the public leaderboard scores in a csv. \nI tried several complicated ways to get a simple csv file of the private leaderboard scores.\nIn the end, pandas came to the rescue in what was a very easy and simplistic method.\nI thought I'd just share it in case someone else needs it in the future.\n\n","ee1123d4":"That's it now you can just select the Team Name and the Score and export it as a csv!\n\n"}}
