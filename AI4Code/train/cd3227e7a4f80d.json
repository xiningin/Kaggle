Cancer starts when cells begin to grow out of control. Breast cancer cells usually form a tumor that can often be seen on an x-ray or felt as a lump. \n\nDepending on the types of cells in a tumor, it can be:\n\n1. **Benign** - The tumor doesn\u2019t contain cancerous cells.\n2. **Malignant** - The tumor contains cancerous cells.\n\n![](https:\/\/gotalktogetherdotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/cancerbenignmalig1.jpg)","04733709":"Now, lets quickly go through the data types of each columns","3cd0a380":"Storing main data set in to another vairiable for our record.","2a095717":"From above sample of code, we can understand that, \"diagnosis\" column is having 2 unique categorical fields.

Now let's move on to our model.\n\nLet's describe data once more","f4a525f9":"And here is the accuracy","ea3e2055":"Looking at the above plaot, we can verify the presence of **multicollinearity** between some of our variables. For instance, the **radius_mean column** has a correlation of **1** and **0.99** with **perimeter_mean** and **area_mean** columns, respectively. This is probably because the three columns essentially contain the same information, which is the physical size of the observation. Therefore we should only pick one of the three columns when we go into further analysis.\n\nAnother place where **multicollienartiy** is apparent is between the **\"mean\"** columns and the **\"worst\"** column. For instance, the **radius_mean** column has a correlation of **0.97** with the **radius_worst** column. In fact, each of the 10 key attributes display very high (from 0.7 up to 0.97) correlations between its **\"mean\"** and **\"worst\"** columns. \n\nThis is somewhat inevitable, because the **\"worst\"** columns are essentially just a subset of the **\"mean\"** columns; the **\"worst\"** columns are also the **\"mean\"** of some values. Therefore, I think we should discard the **\"worst\"** columns from our analysis and only focus on the **\"mean\"** columns.\n\nIn short, we will drop all **\"worst\"** columns from our dataset, then pick only one of the three attributes that describe the size of cells.\n\nSimilarly, it seems like there is **multicollinearity** between the attributes **compactness**, **concavity**, and **concave points**. Just like what we did with the size attributes, we should pick only one of these three attributes that contain information on the shape of the cell. I think **compactness** is an attribute name that is straightforward, so we will remove the other two attributes.\n\nWe will now go head and drop all unnecessary columns.","20bb8850":"# Breast Cancer Dataset Attributes Information:\n\n1st column - ID number,\n2nd column -  Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign),\n3rd to 32nd column -  10 real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:\n\n1. radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)\n2. texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)\n3. perimeter\n4. area\n5. smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)\n6. compactness (perimeter\u00b2 \/ area \u2014 1.0)\n7. concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)\n8. concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)\n9. symmetry\n10. fractal dimension (\u201ccoastline approximation\u201d \u2014 1)\n\nThe **\"mean\"**, **\"standard error(se)\"** and **\u201cworst\u201d** or largest (mean of the three largest values) of these features were computed for each, resulting in 30 features. \n\nFor instance, field 3 is Mean Radius, field 13 is Radius SE, field 23 is Worst Radius.","a659ef9c":"Now,let's explore the data","97dcdcf5":"All columns are having numeric data types except \"diagnosis\".
