Are these fields even, in fact, male-dominated? This analysis aims uses a Kaggle dataset of over 20,000 responses from October 2020 of participants working in positions ranging from  data analyst to machine learning engineer. It aims to answer the following questions:\n\n\nWhat is the ratio of male to female employees and students in the data-related fields?\nIs there a discrepency in type of experience needed depending on the gender of the employee?\nAre there any sub-sectors that feature more than one gender or another? \nWhat are some descriptive statistics of women working in data in the US?\n","38bb6de0":"As we can see from the graph above, women working in data in the US earn more than their male counterparts in the 100-125 thousand USD range and in the 80-100 thousand USD range. However, they learn less in nearly every other category and no takers of the suvey that were female earned more than 200,000. ","9d33a236":"As we can see from the graphs of above, more men hold only a bachelor's degree but there is not major discrepency between the level of education needed by either gender. ","747d3388":"## Exploration","48e69001":"Here, we can already see that there are 3,878 women and 15,789 men who completed the survey. That means that for every women, there are 4 men.\n\nBut, how does this fare depending on the country? \nLet's take a look at the US.

","4a4bf972":"We can see here that each of the major position in the surveys has severe discrepency with software engineering featuring the greatest discrepency and data analyst featuring the least. ","baeb8ef2":"Let's narrow our analysis down by looking at women working in data within the US. \n\nIt would be interesting to look at salary differences but it's difficult to compare these two categories since there are a lot fewer women who took the survey than men. Let's keep these features, but convert some values into percentages to get a clearer picture. ","347be0b8":"First we begin by importing the dataset and checking out some of the features that are present. ","8811df5f":"# Women in Data  ","d766ae5a":"We can see here that each of the major positions in the surveys has severe discrepency with software engineering featuring the greatest discrepency and data analyst and student positions featuring the least.

","6e891313":"Here we can see that in the US,  the discrepency is not as intense since for every women in the field there are 3.5 men. What if we are curious to see how this ratio fares throughout all of the countries listed on our survey? We will visualize this later, but first let's clean up this column a bit. Since we can see that Nonbinary genders and unknown genders make up only about 2% of all of our observations, we can take them out without severely affecting out analysis. "}}
