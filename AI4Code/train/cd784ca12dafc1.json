Nearly a century to achieve parity?!!!\n\nAt the dawn of the 2020s, building fairer and more inclusive economies must be the goal of global, national and industry leaders. To get there, instilling gender parity across education, health, politics and across all forms of economic participation will be critical.\n\nOver the past 14 years the Global Gender Gap Index has served as a compass to track progress on relative gaps between women and men on health, education, economy and politics. Through this annual yardstick, stakeholders within each country are able to set priorities relevant in each specific economic, political and cultural context.\n\nThis year\u2019s report highlights the growing urgency for action. Without the equal inclusion of half of the world\u2019s talent, we will not be able to deliver on the promise of the Fourth Industrial Revolution for all of society, grow our economies for greater shared prosperity or achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals. At the present rate of change, it will take nearly a century to achieve parity, a timeline we simply cannot accept in today\u2019s globalized world, especially among younger generations who hold increasingly progressive views of gender equality. https:\/\/reliefweb.int\/report\/world\/global-gender-gap-report-2020","0cd5bc85":"#High, Upper-Middle and Lower-Middle Incomes\n\nKaggler's Countries are divided according to their income Group: High, Upper-Middle and Lower-Middle Incomes.
