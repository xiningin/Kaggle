I was expecting that a platfrom such as Kaggle would potentially foster a decent population of the informally educated. Especially with the recent rise of MOOCs and free online learning platforms, I figured there might have been more representation of those who either chose or are choosing to forgo a formal university education. It appears however, that this is a much smaller subset than I initially expected. \n\nBeing as I've been in the job hunt without finishing my own college education, I've found myself looking for career advice on blog posts. The issue with blog posts though is you're looking at ancedotal cases. There's no way to know if these stories are weighed down by suvivorship bias, and at the end of the day, what the author is stressing might feel valuable to them, but it very easily might not have been an influencing factor on how they landed where they did.\n\nThe goal of this Kernel is two-fold, one to tell a story of the college-dropout and informally educated Kaggler out there, and two hopefully provide some data based insights on what are the best routes for approaching a data focused career without having completed an undergraduate program.","9bdb2981":"## 2.21 Unemployed Without a Degree, What's the Difference\nWe've went through quite a few different survey questions to begin to understand how those Kagglers who are unemployed stack up against those who are unemployed with a degree. Let's try to paint a picture.\n\nBoth those who are unemployed with and without degrees tend to do some things very similairly.\n* Both groups have the same views on the value of indepedent projects compared to academic achievement.\n* Both groups feel similairly about bootcamps and online education compared to a traditional education.\n* Both groups tend to spend similair amounts of time on tasks when approaching a data project.\n* With the exception of the portion learned from university, both groups gained their data science knowledge in similair manners.\n* Both groups feel similairly about whether or not they are data scientists.\n\nThere some differences though.\n* Those with degrees on average knew more languages, more frameworks, used more types of data, used more data sources, and utilzed more online learning platforms.\n* Those without degrees on average had more favorite data science media sources.\n* A larger proportion of those with degrees were more likely to report Python or R as a primary language.\n* A larger proportion of those without degrees were more likely to report a web language as a primary choice.\n* A significantly larger proportion of those with degrees reported knowing scikit-learn, keras, and randomForest.\n* A significantly larger proportion of those without degrees reoprted knowing PyTorch.\n* Those with degrees tended to have more experience in both coding with data and machine learning.\n* A significantly larger proportion of those without degrees were more likely to report not knowing how to code, or machine learning methods along with no desire to learn.\n* A significantly larger proportion of those with degrees reported having worked with tabular, numerical, catagorical, and time-series data.\n* A significantly larger proportion of those with degrees reported using a coursera course.\n* A significantly larger proportion of those without degrees reported using a fast.ai course.\n* A significantly larger proportion of those with degrees report using a data agregattor as a data source.\n\nThe unemployed degreeless Kaggler is arguably already at a disadvantage, with well not having a degree. While their unemployed peers with a degree would tend to argue that other resources are more important, as well as admit they only learned a fraction of their data science knowledge from a university setting, their peers aren't making the hiring descions. On top of this those without a degree tend to be slightly less exposed, both in time and volume in coding, machine learning, and types of data. There is a sizeable chunk who have expressed no concern for learning these skills as well. Those without a degree have tended to use less resources, but are more exposed to the great resource that is fast.ai. Those without degrees however appear to consume more data science media. Those without degrees are also more likely to do work in web languages.\n\nIt's not a large difference compared to those who are unemployed with degrees, but it does look like a disadvantage beyond just the degree. There's bound to be exposure issues in self-teaching, so what things should you be focusing on if you're an unemployed degreeless Kaggler? I'd reccomend a few:\n\n1.  If you reported not wanting to learn coding or machine learning methods and would like to work in the data science sector, be open to learning.\n2. Start using Python or R more often than something like Javascript or PHP.\n3. Utilize Kaggle's datasets! This site is a great resource for those underrepresented data types.\n4. Take a peek at scikit-learn, a large chunk of those coming out of college have this framework under their belts.\n5. Keep reading those media sources. You're probably invested in the world of data science and machine learning in your free time, and that's great!","d77ff969":"Here we have our first shift. Those without a degree report having significantly more favorite data science media sources. On top of that those without a degree report the Fastai forums, Cloud AI Adventures, and the Data Skeptic Podcasts as their favorite sources significatntly more often. \n\nThis is a point that we should make note of, that those without a degree tend to be more in touch with data sceince media.","428f1c4c":"## 2.5 Comparing Machine Learning Frameworks and How Many\nSimilair to the reported languages used in the past 5 years, let's look at the machine learning frameworks both groups reported using.\n\nQuestion 19:\n\n>\tWhat machine learning frameworks have you used in the past 5 years? ","79b49626":"The average distributions for the groups appear to be significantly different. I would argue that the driving significant difference comes from the fact that, not surprisingly, the average fraction of learning that comes from university for those without a degree is nearly zero.\n\nI'm going to stop here however and point out some interesting things that are going on here. I find it surprising that on average, those with a degree only attribute about 15 percent of their machine learning and data science learning coming from a university. That number is almost identical to the fraction of learning that comes from Kaggles. Go Kaggles! Almost two thirds of the knowledge for both groups comes from online courses and self teaching. ","2a868034":"From here on we're going to not include students in the degree holding group, but we're going to simply refer to the group as degree holding, even if it does exclude graduate students.\n\nWe can now see that there is a flip between Data Scientist and Software Engineer between being the first and second most popular career options. We can also see that Research Scientist is a postition that has popped up, and those unemployed seems lower.","034085ba":"## 2.8 Comparing Machine Learning Experience\nSimilair to above, let's look at the total amount of years working with Machine Learning methods.\n\nQuestion 25:\n\n> For how many years have you used machine learning methods (at work or in school)?","95261ed6":"The only real difference we see here is that there is a greater frequency of 22-24 year olds with a degree than without. We can probably chalk this up to the fact that most individuals in the age of 22-24 who have a degree likely just finished it.","563100bf":"## 2.15 Comparing Online Courses Utilized\nSince we found that for both groups, the majority of their learning comes from online courses, let's see if the courses chosen, and the number of courses differ between the two groups.\n\nQuestion 36:\n\n> On which online platforms have you begun or completed data science courses?

The gap of unemployed Kagglers however is suprisingly narrow in a good number of countires regardless of degree.","4b700a1b":"There's an interesting trend here even if it's not significant. Those with degrees report working in Python and R higher frequency. Python and R are very often the languages people first point to when data science comes to mind. On a more engineering side, those with degrees also report working in C\/C++ and Java more often than their degreeless counterparts. C\/C++ isn't the first choice for any unemployed Kaggler without a degree.\n\nKagglers without degrees however report using web based langauges as their primary language than their degree holding counterparts. Those without degrees more often report using Javascript, PHP, and Ruby than their degree holding counterparts.\n\nI'd say this is a trend that while not significant, we should definetlely make note of.","f7a6845b":"Again these two groups don't appear to value bootcamps much differently.","309e6214":"Right off the bat there's something that sticks out. Kagglers overwhelmingly appear to be current students. For the sake of comparing Kagglers with and without Bachelor's degrees, I'm going to choose to remove the students from the degree holding dataset. The sake of this Kernel was to explore how Kagglers without a formal college education stack up against those who have one. I feel to make this comparison we're okay to throw out our students. This means throwing out PhD and Master's students as well, as arguably these options would be completely off the table for those who haven't completed undergrad yet.\n","96e4a8c6":"We can see that Software Engineering appears to be the most popular career position for those who don't have a Bachelor's Degree.

Kaggle and other data aggreagtors I would argue are some of the easiest sources to come across as well. \n\nAgain this is something to take note of.","66a88006":"Like the number of languages, those with a degree have on average used more machine learning frameworks than those without a degree. On top of that there are some surprising results here as well. Scikit-learn, keras, and randomForest are significantly more frequently reported with those who have a degree than those who don't. While I've used R in the past, I haven't used randomForest, so I can't comment much on that difference. I will say the significantly more with a degree using scikit-learn and keras surprise me. Scikit-learn and keras both feel like very good starting points, so while I can understand why a formal course would perhaps introduce these, I would have also assumed these would have been the frameworks that those wihtout a formal education would have stumbled on first.\n\nEven more suprirsing to me is that those without a significantly more frequently report using PyTorch as their main framework. I'll be honest I had never considered PyTorch as a main driver before, and I'm wondering if there are any MOOCs that are potentially designed around teaching PyTorch. Again, let's make note of that, and maybe come back and see why PyTorch appears to be more popular amongst those without a degree.","2899f0ef":"## Two Mean T-Test\nThis function will output a table that shows whether or not it appears that two means are signifcantly different.\n\nIt takes in two arrays that you wish to compare the means for, as well as their corresponding labels and the title for the test.\n\nIf the p value is less than the significance level (default 0.05) it will specify which of the two groups appears to have the greater mean.","fb532775":"## Single Multiple Choice Question\nThis function is here to observe the the total counts for each choice for a single subset, and optionally plot a bar graph of the counts.
