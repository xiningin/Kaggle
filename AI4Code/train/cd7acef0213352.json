We are also only including 1996-2019 drafts since the dataset only includes stats for those seasons and not any seasons before. Then, we will create a new dataframe and find the averages of all of these stats. Finally, we will plot them in a segmented bar graph.\n","5d98801f":"We will now try to see this effect on one player. We will use Kobe Bryant as an example.","f160107d":"The graph above is a bit difficult to read as there are so many NBA players from different countries. I was not able to make it larger using the figure function. \n\nFrom reading the graph though, we see that the US Virgin Islands, Bahamas, and Germany all have the highest points per game average. The data can be skewed to look like this as there are only a few players in those countries and they just happened to be high scoring players. Since there are so many players from the USA, the average is lower because we are factoring in low scoring players. Virgin Islands is also very high because the dataset has a typo error in which there are two. One includes Tim Duncan which is a high scoring and high rebounding player.\n\nIf we take a look at rebounds, we can see that Congo and  is very high. This is because a lot of Centers and Power Forwards are from the Congo. Such as Dikembe Mutombo. \n\nTaking a look at assists, we see that Spain is the highest. This may be because of players such as Jose Calderon and Ricky Rubio which are well-known as Spanish point guards with great passing ability. ","d9a0adcd":"Here we can see that there is a fluctuation in scoring per season. There seems to be an increase in 2008-2010, but then a decline until another peak in 2018-2020. With the increase in efficient scoring and 3 point shooting in modern basketball, we expect to see an increase, however this is a bit slower of a pace than expected.  ","d3acdc2e":"We can see that at around 6 and half feet tall is where most high scoring happens. Over 7 feet and below 6 feet, there are not too many high scoring players.","5a6a7a5a":"Here we can see a similar pattern to the scatterplot above. Kobe's points per game peaked around 26 years old at 35+ PPG, then started to decline. ","192388fe":"***With the advancement of 3 point shooting and efficient scoring, how are players points per game being affected? ***\n\nHere we will create a bar graph to visualize the averages of points per game from 1996-2019 seasons. We will first take the averages of all the points per game stats on each player. Then we will plot these averages per season from 1996-97 to 2019-20 seasons. This will show us if there is any trend of increase or decrease in scoring.","dac52a87":"**Conclusion\/Directions for Future Work**\n\nAll in all, this project was both exciting and challenging for me as it did answer some interesting questions about the NBA. Being an NBA fan, I was able to compare different relationships such as players points per game and how it changes out of their prime. I was also able to relate certain outcomes to my knowledge of the NBA. The challenging part of it was definitely sorting through the data to set up the plots. Once I figured out how to use functions such as \"where\" and \"groupby\", the analysis became easier to create.\n\nFuture work would consist of diving more deep into the weight and height analysis. I simply made a scatterplot showing the relationship but it is hard to tell what weight and height perform the best as there is such a large group of players with similar heights\/weights. A regression analysis can also be done for the age vs pts plots, we can use it to predict a current players points per game throughout their entire career.  ","0e8dc675":"**Analysis**\n\nWe will start by taking a look at the data:","433a6468":"# Mini Project 1B: Summarizing an NBA dataset\n\n**Overview**\n\nFor this project, I plan to answer multiple questions I am interested in through a series of visualizations.\n\nThese are some of the questions I would like to answer:\n* How does age affect a players performance? What age on average is a normal players' \"prime\"? What about an all star player? \n* At what height and weight do players score the most points on average? \n* What countries' players perform the best? \n* What draft class from 1996 to 2019 performed the best? \n* With the advancement of 3 point shooting and efficient scoring, how are star players points per game being affected? \n\n\n**Data Profile**\n\nThe data set features multiple entities that may be extracted. For example, height, weight, player name, college, country, points per game, rebounds per game etc. Most of the data I decide to extract will depend on the questions I hope to answer.\n\nSome possible limitations of using the data is that some of the data contains strings and integers in the same columns. For example, some players were undrafted instead of given a draft position (1, 2, 34, 29 etc.). This isnt necessarily a limitation but it does remind me that I have to be careful with converting the data when I do my analysis. ","ca9d0200":"Here we can see each draft class from 1996 to 2019 and each of their main stats on average. We see that 1996 is the highest scoring draft class. This makes sense since high scoring players such as Kobe Bryant and Allen Iverson were drafted in 1996. Note that the later year draft classes are relatively low since those players have not hit their prime yet. ","b56aea0f":"***At what height and weight do players score the most points on average?***\n\nNow we will look at heights and weights of all players and compare this with points per game to see at what height or weight are players scoring the most points.","b7639388":"It seems that at 190 to 240 lbs players score the most points. There are quite a few exceptions however with players over 300 lbs sscoring just as many points. This scatterplot does not give us an accurate representation as most players are around the 180-250 lb range anyway.","abf31d2a":"***How does age affect a players performance? What age on average is a normal players' \"prime\"? **\n*\n\nHere we attempt to create a scatterplot using age vs. points to visually see where players tend to peak and how the decline looks like.","a1037af9":"***What countries' players perform the best?***\n\nFinally, we will look at each countries average stats in each country from the dataset.\n","7af21ab7":"We can see here that players generally peak in points per game at around 26-29 years old, then they start to decline as they get older."}}
