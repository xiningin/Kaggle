According to a study, EDA takes around 30% effort of the real-world ML\/Data Science projects.\n\nIn the business environment (even more then in scientific once), the time pressure is one of the factors to drive real-world ML and Data Sciene projects. You have to deliver the results not just of a good-enough (or, event better, of excellent) quality but also within a reasonably limited time frame. \n\nTherefore compressing the EDA time without draining its quality could be one of the benefitial ways to improve the overall ML project performance. That's where hte promise of automated rapid EDA tools starts to sound attractive. \n\nTypically, EDA can be decomposed into two principal parts.\n\n- finding the project-specific insights (this will always require substantial domain expertise to delve into as well as project-specific engineering to visualize data as well as do other EDA activities)\n- doing the routine checks of the data features (statistical checks, missing values, distributions, feature pair interactions etc.)\n\nThe second area is where we can really expect to achieve significant time savings by leveraging appropriate EDA automation. \n\nIn this case study, we are going to demonstrate the benefits and pitfalls of automating routines of EDA for Drug Mechanisms of Action data with the specialized Python packages for rapid EDA below\n\n- Sweetviz\n- Autoviz","299fbdc6":"As we can see, AutoViz does not consider any of the c-features to be significant.

So the EDA results shall set the relevant stage to do it effectively.\n\nIn this EDA, we will try to find patterns in the data, interactions between the drugs in both scored and nonscored datasets and the relationship between drugs and their target genes.\n\nThe first glimpse on the data with the domain expertise in mind draws the following indicators\n- the dataset contains 876 features totally\n- the features which name starts with 'g' signify gene expression data\n- the features which name starts with 'c' signify cell viability data\n- *cp_type* indicates samples treated with a compound\n- *cp_time* and *cp_dose* indicate treatment duration (24, 48, and 72 hours) and dose (high or low). \n\nAs for *cp_type* categories, they are are as follows\n- *trt_cp* indicates the samples treated with the compounds (medicine).\n- *cp_vehicle* (or with a control perturbation (*ctrl_vehicle*) indicate the control samples (control perturbations) that had no MoAs (since there were not any treatment there).\n\nAlso, the subject matter expertise helps us to see we have a multi-label classification problem. Therefore the correlation between the labels is also important and the model selection should be based on the labels correlation. \n\nSo we will have to investigate the patterns not just in the train data but also in the multi-label target data.\n\nAt a first glance, however, we can notice that some of the MoA labels (like *atp-sensitive_potassium_channel_antagonist,    erbb2_inhibitor, antiarrhythmic* etc.) are displayed positively in a really tiny fraction of observations (less then 10 per a MoA label in fact). Therefore predicting them could be tricky as the models may consider them to be a noise (even if the appropriate re-sampling techniques applied to the training set before feeding the data into an ML algorithm).                   \n\nThe above-mentioned rapid EDA packages are nowhere near to help us with the discoveries\/insights of this sort. Only the manual and subject matter-based analysis would capture them.\n\nHowever, the rapid EDA tools can really add value in the routine data quality and variable interaction checks (as displayed in the sections below).
