The data set can be accessed by the link: https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/nobelfoundation\/nobel-laureates\nAs the website showed, the data is from The Nobel Foundation. It contains 969 rows and 18 columns, mainly ordered by year. However, as there is a long history of the Nobel Prize, some of the data in this data set are not updated, like some country or area is changed their name by history reason. A small part of laureates\u2018 information is missing, including the birth date, birth location, and gender information. I tried to filter the missing information and also corrected the location name before visualization. Overall, the data set is had high usability.\n\n"}}
