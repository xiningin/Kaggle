If we plot a graph of the loss w.r.t any individual weight or bias element, it will look like the figure shown below. An important insight from calculus is that the gradient indicates the rate of change of the loss, i.e., the loss function's [slope](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Slope) w.r.t. the weights and biases.\n\nIf a gradient element is **positive**:\n\n* **increasing** the weight element's value slightly will **increase** the loss\n* **decreasing** the weight element's value slightly will **decrease** the loss\n\n![postive-gradient](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/WLzJ4xP.png)\n\nIf a gradient element is **negative**:\n\n* **increasing** the weight element's value slightly will **decrease** the loss\n* **decreasing** the weight element's value slightly will **increase** the loss\n\n![negative=gradient](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/dvG2fxU.png)\n\nThe increase or decrease in the loss by changing a weight element is proportional to the gradient of the loss w.r.t. that element.

Usually, we write programs that take some inputs, perform some operations, and return a result. \n\nHowever, in this notebook, we've defined a \"model\" that assumes a specific relationship between the inputs and the outputs, expressed using some unknown parameters (weights & biases). We then show the model some know inputs and outputs and _train_ the model to come up with good values for the unknown parameters. Once trained, the model can be used to compute the outputs for new inputs.\n\nThis paradigm of programming is known as _machine learning_, where we use data to figure out the relationship between inputs and outputs. _Deep learning_ is a branch of machine learning that uses matrix operations, non-linear activation functions and gradient descent to build and train models.
