used for classification and regression. In both cases, the input consists of the k closest training examples in the feature space. The output depends on whether k-NN is used for classification or regression:\n\nIn k-NN classification, the output is a class membership. An object is classified by a plurality vote of its neighbors, with the object being assigned to the class most common among its k nearest neighbors (k is a positive integer, typically small). If k = 1, then the object is simply assigned to the class of that single nearest neighbor.\nIn k-NN regression, the output is the property value for the object. This value is the average of the values of k nearest neighbors.","26096088":"# 3) Data Exploration","f25030cc":" Using this function describe() we can analysis between the numerical values contained in the data set.

Like all regression analyses, the logistic regression is a predictive analysis.  Logistic regression is used to describe data and to explain the relationship between one dependent binary variable and one or more nominal, ordinal, interval or ratio-level independent variables.","a79717b8":"Heart disease describes a range of conditions that affect your heart. Diseases under the heart disease umbrella include blood vessel diseases, such as coronary artery disease; heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias); and heart defects you're born with (congenital heart defects), among others.\n\nThe term \"heart disease\" is often used interchangeably with the term \"cardiovascular disease.\" Cardiovascular disease generally refers to conditions that involve narrowed or blocked blood vessels that can lead to a heart attack, chest pain (angina) or stroke. Other heart conditions, such as those that affect your heart's muscle, valves or rhythm, also are considered forms of heart disease.\n\n\nWe have a data which classified if patients have heart disease or not according to features in it. We will try to use this data to create a model which tries predict if a patient has this disease or not. We will use logistic regression (classification) algorithm."}}
