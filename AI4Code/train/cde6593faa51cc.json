Inspect the daily vaccinations and COVID-19 case of Egypt.\n* At the first, Egypt has the peak number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 on 19 June 2020, with the largest outbreak number of 1 774 cases. Then, it was starting to decrease gradually untill 02 July 2020, with the number of 1 485. Fortunately, this number was starting to drop down dramatically after this period untill the minimum number of 05 August 2020, to 112 cases, then to the lowest one with 103 cases.  \n* This number seems to be a little stable until another second outbreak number from 23 October 2020, with 170 cases, to 1 418 cases in 21 Decemeber 2020. Luckily, the amount was dropping quickly 509 in 06 February 2021, while the vaccination was taking place on 25 January 2021, with the number of vaccinations 219. \n* However, even the vaccination has been starting over the months, the confirmed cases of COVID-19 are still graudally increasing to another third peak with the number of 1 203 cases on 15 May 2021 while the vaccination number are 40 894 cases. \n* After that, we can see that the number of vaccination keeps increasing the 62 025 cases on 25 May 2021 and the cases of COVID-19 are decreasing to 1 151 on 23 May 2021. \n* It seems like the vaccinations are starting to take the effect after 25 May 2021 and I hope that this confirmed cases of COVID-19 can still keep their reducing numbers because of the increasing number of vaccination.","3545ccde":"## 3. Define the global ranking of Egypt in term of the total number of cases and the total vaccinations per number of people","8743c935":"As we can see in this analysis, Egypt has the daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported around 1 145 cases on May 23 2021 while vaccination numbers are 62 000 on May 25 2021. And the global value in term of fully vaccination is 0.31, which is really quite low comparing to other nations. ","17b35abe":"## 1. The Selected Country\nThe country that I chose to perform this analysis is Egypt sine I heard there are a lot of cases in this country and I am not really familiar with this country as well.","39e774fd":"## 5. Dicuss about the way that the national government of the country is addressing the issue by summarizing from the news.\n\nThe Egyptian government implemented a national lockdown and social distancing measures to control the spread of COVID-19 starting in March 2020. The highest level of central government were responsible for executing the country's policy and institutional response, which was coordinated through the Higher Committee to Combat Coronavirus chaired by the prime minister. The Ministry of Health and Population has played a key role in overseeing the government's ongoing health response, releasing daily briefings on total confirmed cases, recoveries, and death rates across the country. Other state organizations, including the armed forces and state enterprises, have been mobilized to support the governement's response ot the crisis. \n    \nThe government rapidly launched an online portal through the Crisis Management Unit within the Cabinet\u2019s Information and Decision Support Center, which publishes and communicates a wide array of COVID-19-related information to the public through various media channels. The government launched a 24-hour hotline and a smartphone application to enable general access to resources and information on COVID-19. More recently, testing capacity\u2014a challenge in the early months of the outbreak\u2014has been expanded to include 57 laboratories nationwide, as well as mobile drive-through testing facilities. Moreover, the Ministry of Planning and Economic Development has launched an online COVID-19 policy tracker, which provides an interactive platform with details on the 432 COVID-19 policy response measures implemented by 77 government entities to date.\n\nEgypt\u2019s ongoing Economic Transformation Program has been credited with facilitating the government\u2019s accelerated spending on the health sector response, as well as the various economic support measures and programs put in place since the start of the pandemic. The International Monetary Fund revised its initial real gross domestic product (GDP) growth forecast for Egypt\u2019s 2020 fiscal year from 2.0 percent to 3.55 percent \u2013 higher than all Middle East and Central Asia economies and among the few countries globally with a positive growth rate. Given the ongoing impact of the pandemic and anticipated measures to contain a second wave of infections, the country is expected to grow by 2.75 percent in the 2021 fiscal year.\n\n","5cc68180":"## Colored Tables\nCreate colored tables"}}
