The esports industry is continously growing and the future seems to be promising. The number of viewers watching these tournaments is increasing every year and a lot of kids are no longer interested in traditional sports but are dreaming of becoming a professional gamer.\n\nI used this dataset to practice my pandas and numpy skills while gaining additional insight into an industry I am personally interested in.\n\n**Number of peak viewers for esports tournaments in 2018**\n\n![PeakViewers](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/96EWnfq.png)\n\nSource: https:\/\/escharts.com\/2018\n"}}
