","a2351054":"The above three tree diagrams all use area to indicate circulation, and color to indicate sales. Looking at the figures, we can see that game themes are divided into 12 categories, and the market has a high degree of tolerance for each theme. In terms of total distribution and total sales, action games have a higher market share. In terms of excellent works, shooting and platform games are even better, but in general, the distribution and sales of games with different themes The difference is not extreme, and the top ten games in sales involve seven different themes, which shows that the success of a game will not be limited by the theme itself. ","8e12924c":"By comparing the sales of different platforms and combining the above three distribution charts, we can find that the operating strategies of different game platforms are diverse. Taking the top five platforms with higher sales as an example, PS2 and DS mainly focus on volume to win, and High game circulation maintains the continuous operation of the platform. In contrast, X360, Wii and PS3 pay attention to game quality while maintaining the basic circulation, which can also bring fame and fortune.

The first level is all the observations after deleting the missing values, through which we can know the general composition and development trend of the game market. The second level is the top 100 games in the world, and this article regards them as excellent in the game market. The third level is the top 10 games in the world. This article regards them as classics in the game market. When investigating game-related variables, we will analyze these three levels separately, and draw more diverse conclusions through the differences shown by the data at different levels.

For example, Electronic Arts is more popular in Europe and North America. Welcome. In Japan, sales are extremely low. Ubisoft is more popular in Japan, but its business is poor in North America and Europe. ","99fec63f":"View the proportion of total sales in each market through the pie chart: ","defa82cd":"However, the co-occurrence matrix can not only find the most closely related word through a word, but also actively discover the hidden IP names in the game by searching for the largest co-occurrence frequency in the entire matrix. By simply obtaining the ten phrases with the highest co-occurrence frequency, the following IPs can be found by combining the Internet search: ","89a0045f":"From the perspective of the total game market, there are about 31 electronic game distribution platforms. The DS and PS2 platforms have the highest total game distribution. The remaining platforms have successively decreased and more continuous distribution without any gaps, indicating that each platform is no monopoly on game share. ","15b220a2":"It can be seen from the wind rose chart that different platforms have selectivity in the subject matter of the game. For example, the Wii and PS2 platforms mainly publish sports-themed games, while the PS3 and DS platforms are mainly action games. The distribution of games of various themes in the X360 platform is relatively even. ","e8dca304":"It can be seen from the figure that in 2008 and 2009, the distribution of electronic games was the largest, and the sales of published games were also the highest, which can be regarded as the golden age of electronic games. The total sales volume of games in a given year is generally proportional to the number of games released. However, in 2004, although the number of games released was lower than that of the previous two years, the total sales volume of games exceeded the previous two years. High or the emergence of a hot game, by checking the game sales data in 2004 in detail, it is finally judged that the reason is the former. In addition, before 1995, although the number of games issued each year was extremely low, the total sales volume was relatively not low. It may be that the games gradually gained collection value as the years grew,and then purchased by the player.

","66252aab":"Focusing on the third level, you will be surprised to find that half of the top ten games sold are from the Wii platform, which shows the dominance of the Wii platform among excellent games. It is also worth noting that both the GB platform and the NES platform have two games shortlisted in the top ten sales, and their circulation in the first level is only 98 and 97 respectively. At first glance, it seems that the two platforms have high requirements for the quality of their own published games. But after a closer look at the games on these two game platforms, I found that their release time was concentrated in 1983-2001. There are many masterpieces with a total sales value of 10 or more. The platform's game consoles were all discontinued around 2000, and the reason for the discontinuation was that they were replaced by platforms with higher comprehensive performance. Once a smash hit, it will inevitably become a thing of past, which is unavoidable. At the same time, it can be seen that the game industry is deeply affected by technological development, and the most popular game platform will gradually be eliminated with technological innovation.

Based on the three levels of the game, it makes a multi-dimensional comparison of the different values of the above game attributes. After that, the market is segmented and analyzed whether different regional markets have different preferences for the attributes of video games. Finally, based on the idea of text analysis, text mining is performed on the game name. By studying the frequency of a single word and the co-occurrence matrix of two words, it is found that the game name usually involves the game IP. Brief analysis of the relationship between.

For example, the GBA platform has high sales in the North American and European markets, but the sales in Japan is not good. The PS3 platform has high sales in North America and Japan, and the sales in the North American market. The sales volume is relatively low, and the PS2 platform has achieved better results in all three markets. ","43e58f7a":"A total of 17 platforms have issued the games of the second level. X360 and Wii platforms have emerged at this level. Looking back at the first picture, these two platforms belong to the second echelon in terms of total circulation. The comparison shows that they are not forgetting the pursuit of game quality while focusing on market size. ","27d5cec5":"Through the first-level word cloud, we can see that the high-frequency words are \"star\", \"super\", \"dragon\",\"Game\", \"heroes\", \"pro\", etc., just judge the first five words with animation and game color, so it is widely used in game titles, and \"pro\" means professional, and is often placed at the end of the game's original name, indicating a professional version of the game, so it appears more frequently. Looking at the word cloud of the second-level game name, the high-frequency words are \"Pokemon\", \"Mario\", \"Wii\", \"call\", \"duty\". The first two words are translated into Pok\u00e9mon and Mario respectively, which are electronic Characters that often appear in games, and \"Wii\" as the name of the game platform, appears in the game name to indicate the Wii version of the game, and its high frequency is also understandable. But the remaining two words and the \"duck\" and \"blue\" in the third-level word cloud not only fail to understand the reason for their high frequencies from the meaning of the word alone, but they are also not proper nouns. I guess whether they are related to \"Pokemon\". \"The same is a special game IP, but after consulting, it is not found that these single words have the same name of the game IP. The author further guessed whether they may be IP formed by the combination of words, and the word segmentation operation separates the IP and cannot be found. ","968ef255":"By observing the first graph, we can see that the number of games with a total sales value of 0-1 is extremely high. By observing the second graph, we can see that the top-selling game is 40 units higher than the second. Combining the two figures, it can be found that the number of games with a total sales value of more than 10 is relatively small, and the sales value of most games is in the range of 0-1, which to a certain extent reflects the two-eight law of sales in the game industry.
