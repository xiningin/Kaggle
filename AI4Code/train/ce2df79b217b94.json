To conclude, cabins used by 1st class passengers have higher survival rates than cabins used by 2nd and 3rd class passengers. In my opinion **M** (Missing `Cabin` values) has the lowest survival rate because they couldn't retrieve the cabin data of the victims. That's why I believe labeling that group as **M** is a reasonable way to handle the missing data. It is a unique group with shared characteristics. `Deck` feature has high-cardinality right now so some of the values are grouped with each other based on their similarities.\n* **A**, **B** and **C** decks are labeled as **ABC** because all of them have only 1st class passengers\n* **D** and **E** decks are labeled as **DE** because both of them have similar passenger class distribution and same survival rate\n* **F** and **G** decks are labeled as **FG** because of the same reason above\n* **M** deck doesn't need to be grouped with other decks because it is very different from others and has the lowest survival rate.","559d9443":"`Family_Survival_Rate` is calculated from families in training set since there is no `Survived` feature in test set. A list of family names that are occuring in both training and test set (`non_unique_families`), is created. The survival rate is calculated for families with more than 1 members in that list, and stored in `Family_Survival_Rate` feature.\n\nAn extra binary feature `Family_Survival_Rate_NA` is created for families that are unique to the test set. This feature is also necessary because there is no way to calculate those families' survival rate. This feature implies that family survival rate is not applicable to those passengers because there is no way to retrieve their survival rate.\n\n`Ticket_Survival_Rate` and `Ticket_Survival_Rate_NA` features are also created with the same method. `Ticket_Survival_Rate` and `Family_Survival_Rate` are averaged and become `Survival_Rate`, and `Ticket_Survival_Rate_NA` and `Family_Survival_Rate_NA` are also averaged and become `Survival_Rate_NA`.","680e9e5d":"#### **1.2.2 Embarked**\n`Embarked` is a categorical feature and there are only **2** missing values in whole data set.

Values like **Mlle**, **Mme** and **Dona** are actually the name of the passengers, but they are classified as titles because `Name` feature is split by comma. **Dr**, **Col**, **Major**, **Jonkheer**, **Capt**, **Sir**, **Don** and **Rev** titles are replaced with **Dr\/Military\/Noble\/Clergy** because those passengers have similar characteristics. **Master** is a unique title.

Model may not be able to generalize to test set because of this reason.\n\n* Distribution of `Age` feature clearly shows that children younger than 15 has a higher survival rate than any of the other age groups\n* In distribution of `Fare` feature, the survival rate is higher on distribution tails. The distribution also has positive skew because of the extremely large outliers","58d981bc":"When I googled **Stone, Mrs. George Nelson (Martha Evelyn)**, I found that she embarked from **S (Southampton)** with her maid **Amelie Icard**, in this page [Martha Evelyn Stone: Titanic Survivor](https:\/\/www.encyclopedia-titanica.org\/titanic-survivor\/martha-evelyn-stone.html).\n\n> *Mrs Stone boarded the Titanic in Southampton on 10 April 1912 and was travelling in first class with her maid Amelie Icard.

Those classes are very helpful to predict whether the passenger is a survivor or victim. Best categorical features are `Pclass` and `Sex` because they have the most homogenous distributions.\n\n* Passengers boarded from **Southampton** has a lower survival rate unlike other ports. More than half of the passengers boarded from **Cherbourg** had survived. This observation could be related to `Pclass` feature\n* `Parch` and `SibSp` features show that passengers with only one family member has a higher survival rate","199156f4":"### **3.2 Feature Importance**","a29b8f2d":"There are too many unique `Ticket` values to analyze, so grouping them up by their frequencies makes things easier.\n\n**How is this feature different than `Family_Size`?** Many passengers travelled along with groups. Those groups consist of friends, nannies, maids and etc. They weren't counted as family, but they used the same ticket.\n\n**Why not grouping tickets by their prefixes?** If prefixes in `Ticket` feature has any meaning, then they are already captured in `Pclass` or `Embarked` features because that could be the only logical information which can be derived from the `Ticket` feature.\n\nAccording to the graph below, groups with **2**,**3** and **4** members had a higher survival rate. Passengers who travel alone has the lowest survival rate. After **4** group members, survival rate decreases drastically. This pattern is very similar to `Family_Size` feature but there are minor differences. `Ticket_Frequency` values are not grouped like `Family_Size` because that would basically create the same feature with perfect correlation. This kind of feature wouldn't provide any additional information gain.","851754ff":"### **1.6 Conclusion**\nMost of the features are correlated with each other. This relationship can be used to create new features with feature transformation and feature interaction. Target encoding could be very useful as well because of the high correlations with `Survived` feature.\n\nSplit points and spikes are visible in continuous features. They can be captured easily with a decision tree model, but linear models may not be able to spot them.\n\nCategorical features have very distinct distributions with different survival rates. Those features can be one-hot encoded. Some of those features may be combined with each other to make new features.\n\nCreated a new feature called `Deck` and dropped `Cabin` feature at the **Exploratory Data Analysis** part.","ecfc2630":"#### **2.1.1 Fare**\n`Fare` feature is positively skewed and survival rate is extremely high on the right end. **13** quantile based bins are used for `Fare` feature. Even though the bins are too much, they provide decent amount of information gain. The groups at the left side of the graph has the lowest survival rate and the groups at the right side of the graph has the highest survival rate. This high survival rate was not visible in the distribution graph. There is also an unusual group **(15.742, 23.25]** in the middle with high survival rate that is captured in this process.","be2eb14f":"In order to be more accurate, `Sex` feature is used as the second level of `groupby` while filling the missing `Age` values. As seen from below, `Pclass` and `Sex` groups have distinct median `Age` values. When passenger class increases, the median age for both males and females also increases. However, females tend to have slightly lower median `Age` than males. The median ages below are used for filling the missing values in `Age` feature.","de871608":"#### **2.5.1 Label Encoding Non-Numerical Features**\n`Embarked`, `Sex`, `Deck` , `Title` and `Family_Size_Grouped` are object type, and `Age` and `Fare` features are category type. They are converted to numerical type with `LabelEncoder`. `LabelEncoder` basically labels the classes from **0** to **n**. This process is necessary for models to learn from those features.","be383aea":"### **2.4 Target Encoding**\n`extract_surname` function is used for extracting surnames of passengers from the `Name` feature. `Family` feature is created with the extracted surname. This is necessary for grouping passengers in the same family. ","10252028":"## **0. Introduction**\n\nI decided to write this kernel because **Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster** is one of my favorite competitions on Kaggle. This is a beginner level kernel which focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis** and **Feature Engineering**. A lot of people start Kaggle with this competition and they get lost in extremely long tutorial kernels. This is a short kernel compared to the other ones. I hope this will be a good guide for starters and inspire them with new feature engineering ideas.\n\n**Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster** is a great competition to apply domain knowledge for feature engineering, so I made a research and learned a lot about Titanic. There are many secrets to be revealed beneath the Titanic dataset. I tried to find out some of those secret factors that had affected the survival of passengers when the Titanic was sinking. I believe there are other features still waiting to be discovered. \n\nThis kernel has **3** main sections; **Exploratory Data Analysis**, **Feature Engineering** and **Model**, and it can achieve top **2%** (**0.83732**) public leaderboard score with a tuned Random Forest Classifier. It takes 60 seconds to run whole notebook. If you have any idea that might improve this kernel, please be sure to comment, or fork and experiment as you like. If you didn't understand any part, feel free to ask.","b7b9102e":"### **2.6 Conclusion**\n`Age` and `Fare` features are binned. Binning helped dealing with outliers and it revealed some homogeneous groups in those features. `Family_Size` is created by adding `Parch` and `SibSp` features and **1**. `Ticket_Frequency` is created by counting the occurence of `Ticket` values.\n\n`Name` feature is very useful. First, `Title` and `Is_Married` features are created from the title prefix in the names. Second, `Family_Survival_Rate` and `Family_Survival_Rate_NA`  features are created by target encoding the surname of the passengers. `Ticket_Survival_Rate` is created by target encoding the `Ticket` feature. `Survival_Rate` feature is created by averaging the `Family_Survival_Rate` and `Ticket_Survival_Rate` features.\n\nFinally, the non-numeric type features are label encoded and categorical features are one-hot encoded. Created **5** new features (`Family_Size`, `Title`, `Is_Married`, `Survival_Rate` and `Survival_Rate_NA`) and dropped the useless features after encoding.","cb11c269":"#### **1.2.4 Cabin**\n`Cabin` feature is little bit tricky and it needs further exploration. The large portion of the `Cabin` feature is missing and the feature itself can't be ignored completely because some the cabins might have higher survival rates. It turns out to be the first letter of the `Cabin` values are the decks in which the cabins are located. Those decks were mainly separated for one passenger class, but some of them were used by multiple passenger classes.\n![alt text](https:\/\/vignette.wikia.nocookie.net\/titanic\/images\/f\/f9\/Titanic_side_plan.png\/revision\/latest?cb=20180322183733)\n* On the Boat Deck there were **6** rooms labeled as **T, U, W, X, Y, Z** but only the **T** cabin is present in the dataset\n* **A**, **B** and **C** decks were only for 1st class passengers\n* **D** and **E** decks were for all classes\n* **F** and **G** decks were for both 2nd and 3rd class passengers\n* From going **A** to **G**, distance to the staircase increases which might be a factor of survival"}}
