entities (people, places, organizations etc.) from a chunk of text, and classifying them into a predefined set of categories.\nFor understanding NER here is very good article : https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/named-entity-recognition-with-nltk-and-spacy-8c4a7d88e7da\n\nWe will be using spacy for creating our own customised NER model or models (seperate for each Sentiment).The motivation for this approach is off course the kernel shared by Rohit Singh,so if you find his kernel useful please upvote it.\n\nWhat will be different with my solution:\n* I will use text as selected_text for all neutral tweets due to their high jaccard similarity\n* Also I will use text as selected_text for all tweets having number of words less than 3 in text as explained before\n* I will train two different models for Positive and Negtive tweets\n* I will not preprocess the data because the selected text contains raw text","50249b3c":"## Conclusion Of EDA\n\n* We can see from the jaccard score plot that there is peak for negative and positive plot around score of 1 .That means there is a cluster of tweets where there is a high similarity between text and selected texts ,if we can find those clusters then we can predict text for selected texts for those tweets irrespective of segment\n\nLet's see if we can find those clusters,one interesting idea would be to check tweets which have number of words lesss than 3 in text, because there the text might be completely used as text","dfa45dd0":"Let's look at the distribution of Meta-Features","78b4014e":"# About this Competition\n\nYou are someone who is recently starting on NLP or has become a master ,irrespective of where you lie in the learning chain , I can bet you have worked on sentiment analysis and if not you will be going to, you just can't bypass it. Can You?. <b>Sentiment analysis<\/b> is for NLP <b>'what Happy Birthday to You'<\/b> is for Guitar players Right? You start here <br>\n<br>\nIn case you are not aware about sentiment analysis here is a very good article : https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/sentiment-analysis-concept-analysis-and-applications-6c94d6f58c17\n<br><br>\nRecently Kaggle Lauched a new competition admist the COVID-19 Scare , named Twitter Sentiment Extraction ,I know right its a twitter sentiment analysis competition,But kaggle never disappoints you,it could not have been this straightforward, afterall it has go on for two months.So what this competition asks for is not the sentiment scores but the part of the tweet (word or phrase) that reflects the sentiment., Interesting it isn't it?
