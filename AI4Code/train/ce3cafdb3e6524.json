Printing Types\nPython comes with different types in order to do different things.\n\nA string is always between the \"\" quotations marks such as \"Hello World\", an Int is a number without a decimal you can do calculations with such as 2, and a Float is a number with a decimal you can do a calculation with such as 2.0 and 2.2. There are more types in python, but let's focus on these 3 for now.\n\nA Reminder of Python Types: \n\n| Name           | Type   | Description                                                  |\n|----------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Integer        | Int    |Whole numbers: 45, -5, 670                                    |\n| Float          | Float  |Numbers with a decimal point: 2.3, 4.6, 100.0                 |\n| String         | Str    |Ordered sequence of characters: \u201cSammy\u201d, \u201cHello\u201d, \u201c2000\"      |\n| List           | List   |Ordered sequence of objects: [10, \u201chello\u201d, 200.5]             |\n| Dictionarie    | Dict   |Unordered Key\/value pairs: {\u201ckey\u201d: \u201cvalue\u201d, \u201cname\u201d: \u201cFrankie\u201d}|\n| Tuple          | Tup    |Ordered immutable sequence of objects: (10, \u201chello\u201d, 200.5)   |\n| Set            | Set    |Unordered collection of unique objects: {\u201ca\u201d, \u201cb\u201d}            |\n| Boolean        | Bool   |Logical value (True or False)                                 |\n\n<span style=\"display:none\"><\/span>\n#### Right now we will only focus on Integer, Float, and String\n\n1.

For a very quick introduction to the coding environment, [check out this video](https:\/\/youtu.be\/4C2qMnaIKL4).\n\nKernels (also known as notebooks) are composed of blocks (called \"cells\") of text and code. Each of these is editable, though you'll mainly be editing the code cells to answer some questions.\n\nCommon Notebook Keyboard Shortcuts For Commands:\n\n| Shortcut       | Description             | \n|----------------|-------------------------|\n| Enter          | enter edit mode         |\n| Shift-\u00adEnter   | run cell, select below  |\n| Ctrl-Enter     | run cell                |\n| Alt-Enter      | run cell, insert below  |\n[More Shortcuts](https:\/\/www.cheatography.com\/weidadeyue\/cheat-sheets\/jupyter-notebook\/).\n<span style=\"display:none\"><\/span>\n\n\n\n","84b34735":"## 3.

They are created using the # symbol and turn blue when properly commented. \n\nLet's try it!\n","831e0d9c":" # Cafe 1 - The Kaggle Environment, Print & Variables","c8652834":"## 1.

Position your print statements so that you print `a` and `b` before AND after the swap.\n\nHINT: You need 3 variables and 2 print statements to complete this task","a8fe4adf":"That's all for our first coding cafe! \n\nTry some more exercises at home: [Extra Excercises](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/dianaboras\/python-cafe-1-extra-exercises) \n\nWe will see you next Thursday! \n\n","67ba19d7":"## 5.  Printing Variables\nLet's create our first variable! A variable holds a value of any type, be it an Int, String, Float or others. We use the = sign to assign a value to a variable.\n\n1. Create a Variable named myString and assign it the value \"This is the value\"\n2. Create a Variable named myInt and assign it the value 23 \n3. Print your variables\n4. Create a new variable myOtherInt and assign it the value of myInt, print myOtherInt\n5. Change the values and print again"}}
