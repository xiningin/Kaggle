It groups the customers on the basis of their previous purchase transactions. How recently, how often, and how much did a customer buy. RFM filters customers into various groups for the purpose of better service. It helps managers to identify potential customers to do more profitable business. There is a segment of customer who is the big spender but what if they purchased only once or how recently they purchased? Do they often purchase our product? Also, It helps managers to run an effective promotional campaign for personalized service.","656b521a":"RFM Result Interpretation\n\nCombine all three quartiles(r_quartile,f_quartile,m_quartile) in a single column, this rank will help you to segment the customers well group","6c9c3900":"**Data Preprocessing**","a22c108f":"Here, I am going to perform following opertaions:\n\nFor Recency, Calculate the number of days between present date and date of last purchase each customer.\nFor Frequency, Calculate the number of orders for each customer. \nFor Monetary, Calculate sum of purchase price for each customer.","9aa97d47":"#In this figer we can see most of thr customers are from \"United Kingdom\".so we filter data for UK customer","4021f594":"**pls upvote if you found helpfil.**","ed979bec":"Computing Quantile of RFM values\n\nCustomers with the lowest recency, highest frequency and monetary amounts considered as top customers.\n\nqcut() is Quantile-based discretization function. qcut bins the data based on sample quantiles.
