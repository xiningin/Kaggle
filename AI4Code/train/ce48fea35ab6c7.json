Looking at the coefficient on winter, it seems that users may consume less water in summer, which may be for a variety of reasons.

","588fc9f4":"This dataset is massive, and among other preprocessing steps, was a step to subsample and filter the data to focus on domestic users.  While one challenge issues in this dataset is to optimally impute data, given the size of the data, I opted to drop rows with missing data and assumed that this was not correlated with featrues in the data.  Another assumption I made in modelling income, was to assume that income was correlated to residential areas marked as social housing, low-income housing, middle-income houding and high-income housing.  One of the interesting features I was keen to investigate in this study was how seasonability- or a winter effect- may change consumption habbits. ","787e3b12":"One of my favourite papers of all time is a 1985 paper entitle, \"Perception of price when price information is costly: evidence from residential electricity demand\".  In this paper, Shin uses some really elegant regression modelling to try to determine whether consumers make decision on electricity consumption, based on their marginal price (ei the price for their next unit under a progressive block pricing schedule) or based on their average price over their units consumed.  \n  \nFor businesses and policy makers this can provide crucial insight into the efficacy of different pricing policies in changing consumer behaviour.  In water and electricity consumption this can be critical in ensuring equitible consumption and in ensuring the sustainability of the energy or water supplier.  For economist researching demand, modelling consumer behaviour is critical.  Typically, when economists think about consumer behaviour they are interested in how income, price and the price of substitutes affect demand.  To investigate these affects they look to the idea of elasticity- how do changes in price and income affect changes demand.  For Shin, the primary interest for whether changes in average price or changes in marginal price affected changes in demand.  To do this he used a regression model.  \n\nTo investigate this elasticity of price and income, economists typically apply a log transform to their endogenous variables (like quantity) and exogenous variables (like price and incomes) to approximate this idea of percent change. In Shin's paper, he defines the following model:\n  \n$ln(\\textit{units of demand}) = \\beta_1 ln(\\textit{income}) + \\beta_2 ln(\\textit{units of demand at a previous timestep}) + \\beta_3 ln(\\textit{marginal price}) + \\beta_4 ln(\\frac{\\textit{average price}}{\\textit{marginal price}}) + ... +\\beta_0$\n\nUsing this model, he not only analyze the elasticity of margin price and income but, using $\\beta_4$, whether consumers make decisions based on averaeg price or marginal price.  Using this model, if $\\beta_4$ is positive consumers make decisions based on average price and if $\\beta_4$ is negative then their is evidence that consumers use merginal price.   \nThe major challenge in using the AguaH dataset is mainly that I could not find a real block-pricing schedule for period over which the data was collected.  I managed to track down the current Block Pricing Schedule, with some help but was unable to find the historic schedule on Internet Archive. This will force us to asssume that these are Real Prices and that the structure of the schedules have not changed over time but instead moved in lock-step inline with wages and inflation. \n  \n[1] http:\/\/aguadehermosillo.gob.mx\/aguah\/tarifas\/ accessed 20 March 2020  \n[2] Shin, J.S., 1985. Perception of price when price information is costly: evidence from residential electricity demand. The review of economics and statistics, pp.591-598.","fe19be55":"Another major concern, is the slight heteroskedasticity on our marginal_over_average, marginal and quantity_lag, this may create some doubt on the findings of our model and may provide evidence that the structure of our blocks are incorrectly specified. Looking at our mixed-effects estimates we see that the errors on black 12 in 2010 and 2012 are large suggesting that these blocks may have been shifted over this time and may be introducing error into our model.
