COVID-19 pandemic. While there are many well curated datasets tracking the pandemic on their platform, the one I have been interesting in exploring has been on the number of cases in different countries around the world through time. ","f9914561":"I would love to hear from people on how this analysis could be improved and possible data science projects they have looking at the virus. ","c3c596fd":"You have probably seen these two plots before: a plot of the number of confirmed cases in each country through time and a plot of the number of confirmed cases overlayed onto a map.  For many people this is an easy and intuitive view of the scale of the crisis each government has to deal with, but globally this can be misleading as it does not control for obvious factors like population size.  ","1e45b591":"I know a lot of professionals and hobbyists in the Data Sciences have looked to contribute to the public understanding of the COVID-19 Pandemic affecting the world and I have been proud to be part of such an amazing community driven by 'Data Science for Good'. In this notebook I try to provide some interesting plots, which aim to investigate how plots and metrics can mislead people about the state of the infection globally and propose a possible way in which we can control for these common pitfalls to provide possible insights on where we see the high growth in infections globally.  ","87f92e55":"The obvious this we can do then is divide by the population estimates in these countries to get the number of confirmed cases and fatalities per capita, but the obvious mistake in this analysis is in not then accounting for population density as well.  We know for many countries population density is an important factor and I may argue that while we expect population density is proportional to the spread, we may also expect density to be proportional to access to health as people in rural areas may have to have healthcare professionals travel far to get tested. ","8e8434a3":"The next thing to control for in the dara was weeks since first infection in a given country, to get a better sense of how different countries we reponding the crisis. In order to do this I opted to do a regression model of growth in Infections per Capita, per Population Density against time and country to get a sense of Excess Growth Rate of Infections per Capita, per Population Density. While this is not a perfect model, as they are many factors such as recovery rates unaccounted for, this is still an interesting metrics to look at. ","2b43c244":"Another important factor to look at then is how this infections spreads within countries. Looking at its spread, we can see how new countries register infections through time.  One challenge in looking at this data and the growth in the infection in these countries is stage of the crisis the countries find themselves in.  In order to get a better sense of public responses to the virus, we can then look rather at the number of weeks since the first infection in a particular country rather than just the Infections per Capita, per Population Density at a given points in time. Here we see Iceland leading the pack. While this may signal the state of the infection in the country, we do that testing has been more availible in some countries that others and this may just reflect the unobserved availibility of testing not seen in the data. ","b817587c":"If we control for this density, we then see a very different map of the world. While density can be misleading, as in Australia, Russia or Brazil where large parts of the country are very sparsely habbitted we assume that this clustering to large cities in large sparse countries is relatively consistent accross nations.
