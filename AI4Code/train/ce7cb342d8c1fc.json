I admit that I am greedy. I want to get good salary. So, I decided to find out what kind of skills I should have in order to earn high salary, by using natural language processing techniques.\n\n#### Strategy\n\n- Check the distribution of salaries of jobs in New York City.\n- Check text descriptions of the requirements for jobs and preferred skills.\n- Identify specific words related to the jobs with top 25 percentile salaries by TF-IDF\n\n#### Reference\n\n- Sebastian Raschka and Vahid Mirjalili, Python Machine Learning: Machine Learning and Deep Learning with Python, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow, 2nd Edition.

Conclusion\n\nHere we found the following patterns.\n\n- If you have some software engineering skills, it should be quite helpful to get good minimum salary.

You need to have\u3000managerial\/administrative skills, knowledge and experience.\n\nIn short, it turned out that there is no way for me to get easy money...
