Which budget ranges should be considered for making a Box Office success?\n\n**Analysis**\n\nIn order to answer this question I will examine several key things:\n\n- What is the relationship between profit (profit margin) and budget?\n\nBudget and profit show a clear positively linear relationship, which means that the higher the budget, the higher the profit of a movie.\n\nThe trend line in this plot of profit margin and budget is showing a negative trend, which can be explained by the fact that if we spend too much money on making a movie we can potentially descrease our profit margin.\n\n- What is the average and median value of budget for the top 30 movies? and of total?\n- What is the average and median value of profit margin for the top 30 movies? and of total?\n\nBoth averages and median values differ, so in order to adjust for obvious outliers such as Avatar, Jurassic World, and Titanic, we will consider the median values.\n\n**Recommendation**\n\n- The optimal budget value for making a successfull movie should not be less than 40 Million US dollars, and on average I recommend it to be somewhere around 75 Million US dollars. This recommendation was made based on a profit margin greater than 0.6. There is evidence that higher budget movies risk a smaller profit margin, as shown in the plot, therefore we cannot conclude that very large budgets to be a certain indicator of a Box Office success.\n\n**Visualizing the relationship between profit (profit margin) and budget?**\n\n* In order to analyse this relatonship I needed to create a new dataframe containing movies with profit greater than 0\n\n","c0f3c9c4":"## 3.4 Mismatched data types\n\n**Analysis**\n\n* On further research I identified huge outliers in the budget value, which I procedeed to identify as a currency mismatch. The currencies of gross and budget values correspond to their county of origin: The highest value is a South Korean movie with a budget of 4000 million Korean wons (KRW)\n\n* All USA movies appear to have the same curency: US dollar. All non-USA English speaking countries (New Zealand, UK, Australia etc.) appear to have their budgets expressed in US dollars.\n\n**Recommendation**\n\n* The best course of action would be to update the budget values to a uniform currency in USD. However, this raises a couple of questions: are budget values corrected for inflation accross all coutries in the dataset, and is there a reliable way to convert said budget values to another currency? The answers to both questions need to be asked from the source in order to make said updates to he dataset.\n\n**Action taken**\n\n* Because of the limited project time frame, I decided to remove all non-English speaking movies from the dataset.\n\n","77b45409":"## 5.2 Do actors\/actresses and directors play a role in a movie's success?\n\n**Analysis**\n\nWe will be working with actor1_total dataframe and director_total dataframe.\n\n* It appears that movies where Robert Pattison stars, make almost 9 times the amount of the average movie.\n* Directors play a significant role, movies directed by George Lucas make little over 12 times the amount of the average movie.\n* Average mean VAR of actor\/actress - 3.51\n* Average mean VAR of directors - 3.36\n* Average median VAR of actor\/actress - 3.03\n* Average median VAR of directors - 2.53\n\n**Recommedation**\n\n* Analysis of the value actors\/actresses and directors bring to the movies value is considerable. I can recommend that the studio takes in to account the VAR score of a actor\/actress, and even more the VAR score of the person who will direct the movie.\n\n* For actors\/actresses I recommend a range value of VAR between 1.0 and 3.0\n* For directors I recommend a range value of VAR between 1.0 and 2.53\n\n","63438da0":"# 3.

After a series of box office flops, the producers of the said studio are starting to question their strategy and need some direction. I suggest a new approach - using data to determine what factors go into making a successful film. Luckily, I have a dataset of over 5000 films to mine for insights. My producers ask me to spend some time analyzing the data and present a report detailing your findings, along with recommendations on how to revamp the studio\u2019s strategy.\n\nIn order to analyze data and find best recommendations for the studio, I explored a couple of questions based on reasearch and various assumptions:\n\n* What is the correlation between budget and profit?

Fortunately for them, there are many answers to the question, and some of them were presented in this project. I would separate a couple of important recommendations as part of this conclusion.\n\nThe data available showed that budget values between $40 MM and $75 MM, for a good profit margin of 0.6. The most profitable genres are Animation, Adventure, and Family \u2014 all three are PG-13 content rating. Also, included in the recommendation, is the importance of directors and actors\/actresses. Directors with an average movie score above 7 show great potential to bring significant value to a movie, even so if their VAR score is between 1.0 and 2.5. The same goes for actors\/actresses \u2014 if their VAR score is between 1.0 and 3.0, they will bring value to a movie.\n\nAs the quest for a more detailed analysis and answers is always on, I will include a couple of Future recommendations that I deem to be potentially valuable to the studio.\n\n### Feature recommendations\n\nI recommend including and exploring data on Oscar winning directors, actors\/actresses, and movies. During my time working on this project, I wondered if creating sequels is a good opportunity for a successful movie \u2014 this is something I would also consider including. Besides that, I would also add demographic information of users if applicable, and other movie studio box office successes in the dataset in order to obtain more detailed analysis. I believe this information would bring additional insight into assessing determinants of a Box Office success.\n\n## Acknowledgments\nThanks to [jeremy-lee93](https:\/\/github.com\/jeremy-lee93\/dsc-mod-1-project-v2-1-onl01-dtsc-pt-052620) for an inspiration regarding the VAR values, as well as exploring the profit margin.\n\n## Licenses\n[Database Contents License (DbCL) v1.0](https:\/\/opendatacommons.org\/licenses\/dbcl\/1-0\/)\n\n## Contact\nFind me on [LinkedIn](https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/tanja-ad%C5%BEi%C4%87\/), [Twitter](https:\/\/twitter.com\/adzic_tanja) or [adzictanja.com](https:\/\/adzict.github.io\/)."}}
