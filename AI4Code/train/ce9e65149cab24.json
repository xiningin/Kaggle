You can use cross validation on random forests, but OOB validation already provides a good estimate of performance and building several random forest models to conduct K-fold cross validation with random forest models can be computationally expensive.\n\nThe random forest classifier assigns an importance value to each feature used in training. Features with higher importance were more influential in creating the model, indicating a stronger association with the response variable.

Although Python is a beginner-friendly programming language, it was not built specifically for data analysis, so we relied heavily upon libraries to extend base Python's functionality when doing data analysis. As a series focused on practical tools and geared toward beginners, we didn't always take the time to dig deep into the details of the language or the statistical and predictive models we covered. My hope is that some of the lessons in this guide piqued your interest and equipped you with the tools you need to dig deeper on your own.\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about Python for data science, your best bet is to use what you've learned to tackle a project that interests you. An easy way to get started is to use the Kaggle kernel platform we've used in this guide to tackle a Kaggle competition or analyze an existing Kaggle dataset. Reading guides, books and taking online courses is a good way to build your foundational knowledge, but jumping in and doing projects--and learning what you need to know along the way--is probably the best way to learn.\n\nOne of the hardest parts of learning a new skill is getting started. If any part of this guide helped you get started, it has served its purpose.\n\n*Final Note: If you are interested in learning R, I have a [30-part introduction to R](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/hamelg\/intro-to-r-index) guide that covers most of the same topics as this Python guide and recreates many of the same examples in R.*","13f73a2a":"# Random Forest Basics","d1308ab4":"For the final lesson in this guide, we'll learn about random forest models. As we saw last time, decision trees are a conceptually simple predictive modeling technique, but when you start building deep trees, they become complicated and likely to overfit your training data. In addition, decision trees are constructed in a way such that branch splits are always made on variables that appear to be the most significant first, even if those splits do not lead to optimal outcomes as the tree grows. Random forests are an extension of decision trees that address these shortcomings.","7fc57888":"A random forest model is a collection of decision tree models that are combined together to make predictions. When you make a random forest, you have to specify the number of decision trees you want to use to make the model. The random forest algorithm then takes random samples of observations from your training data and builds a decision tree model for each sample. The random samples are typically drawn with replacement, meaning the same observation can be drawn multiple times. The end result is a bunch of decision trees that are created with different groups of data records drawn from the original training data.\n\nThe decision trees in a random forest model are a little different than the standard decision trees we made last time. Instead of growing trees where every single explanatory variable can potentially be used to make a branch at any level in the tree, random forests limit the variables that can be used to make a split in the decision tree to some random subset of the explanatory variables. Limiting the splits in this fashion helps avoid the pitfall of always splitting on the same variables and helps random forests create a wider variety of trees to reduce overfitting.\n\nRandom forests are an example of an ensemble model: a model composed of some combination of several different underlying models. Ensemble models often yields better results than single models because different models may detect different patterns in the data and combining models tends to dull the tendency that complex single models have to overfit the data.","8202cccc":"# Random Forests on the Titanic","8106cc32":"# Python for Data 30: Random Forests\n[back to index](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/hamelg\/python-for-data-analysis-index)","a0ec7067":"# Python for Data Analysis Conclusion","2780eff7":"Upon submission, the random forest model achieves an accuracy score of 0.74641, which is actually worse than the decision tree model and even the simple gender-based model. What gives? Is the model overfitting the training data? Did we choose bad variables and model parameters? Or perhaps our simplistic imputation of filling in missing age data using median ages is hurting our accuracy. Data analyses and predictive models often don't turn out how you expect, but even a \"bad\" result can give you insight into your problem and help you improve your analysis or model in a future iteration."}}
