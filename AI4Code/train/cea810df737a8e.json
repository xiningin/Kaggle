","14ddc6d7":"# Enabling and Testing the GPU\nWhile working on large dataset or some critical project such as computer vision \/ image processing etc, we may need GPU or TPU to use along with the provided CPU.\n\nSome how I was strugling on how to get on to it, and after reaading some articles and kaggle notebooks, I concluded the below code, which ensures that GPU is turned on and it is going to be consumed with the project we are running on it.\n\nNote : Turning on GPU will reduce the number of CPUs available and will only speed up image processing and neural networks.\n\nAlso there is a limit on the usage of GPU, it is limited to 34 hr for a week. This quota gets reset weekly.\n\nThe limit of 30-34 hrs is based on today. In future it may or may not change.","0898478f":"# Step 1 : Verify if the GPU is On or not.\nOn the right top corner, you will have the options such as HDD; CPU; RAM and GPU as well. \nIf GPU is displayed there then it is ON, and we should be good to use the GPU. Now re-run the above code, and it should find the GPU for you.\nIn-case it is not displayed there, then follow step # 2 to configure it.\n\n![image.png](attachment:image.png)","8fdbd7e5":"# Step 2 : Configure the GPU.\nOn the same right top corner along with HDD; CPU and RAM there will be vertical 3 dots.
