Using worldwide data, you will focus on a generalized solution to estimate the number and size of wheat heads. To better gauge the performance for unseen genotypes, environments, and observational conditions, the training dataset covers multiple regions. You will use more than 3,000 images from Europe (France, UK, Switzerland) and North America (Canada). The test data includes about 1,000 images from Australia, Japan, and China.","bdba491d":"## Global Wheat Detection: Can you help identify wheat heads using image analysis?\n\n> Open up your pantry and you\u2019re likely to find several wheat products. Indeed, your morning toast or cereal may rely upon this common grain. Its popularity as a food and crop makes wheat widely studied. To get large and accurate data about wheat fields worldwide, plant scientists use image detection of \"wheat heads\"\u2014spikes atop the plant containing grain. These images are used to estimate the density and size of wheat heads in different varieties. Farmers can use the data to assess health and maturity when making management decisions in their fields.\n\n![](https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/kaggle-media\/competitions\/UofS-Wheat\/descriptionimage.png)\n\n> However, accurate wheat head detection in outdoor field images can be visually challenging. There is often overlap of dense wheat plants, and the wind can blur the photographs. Both make it difficult to identify single heads. Additionally, appearances vary due to maturity, color, genotype, and head orientation. Finally, because wheat is grown worldwide, different varieties, planting densities, patterns, and field conditions must be considered. Models developed for wheat phenotyping need to generalize between different growing environments. Current detection methods involve one- and two-stage detectors (Yolo-V3 and Faster-RCNN), but even when trained with a large dataset, a bias to the training region remains.","47860fa4":"Now, let's take a look at images in the test-folder, for which we need to make predictions\n>You are attempting to predict bounding boxes around each wheat head in images that have them. If there are no wheat heads, you must predict no bounding boxes.","d83ea0d3":"So, there are roughly 43 bounding boxes for each image_id. The overall distribution is plotted below","5ecef075":"This will be a fun competition to participate as this is a detection-based competition. It would be a nice opportunity to learn(and use) the recent advancements in Image-Detection domain such as [EfficientDet](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1911.09070) and [YoloV4](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2004.10934)\n> Expect a lot of computer-vision loving Kagglers to join as the dataset is not that huge compared to other ongoing vision competitions.
