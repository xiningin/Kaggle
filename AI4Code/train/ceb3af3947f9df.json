I will flag up some of the many gotchas in this type of simulation. The strategy is attributed to Richard Dennis and his team of \"turtle\" traders, check out the book \"Way of the Turtle\" for more details.\n\nNote I would strongly recommend that you not actually trade this, this is purely a simple example to highlight various tricks and pitfalls with the data. This kernel does not consitute trading or financial advice in anyway. Bitcoin is a particularly volatile market with some unique challenges and not the place to start in my limited opinion if you are interested in algorithmic trading.\n\nThis is a work in progress, please comment if you'd like to see more and I will extend it for the execution simulation"}}
