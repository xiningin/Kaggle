Customer Personality Analysis is a detailed analysis of a company\u2019s ideal customers. It helps a business to better understand its customers and makes it easier for them to modify products according to the specific needs, behaviors and concerns of different types of customers.\nCustomer personality analysis helps a business to modify its product based on its target customers from different types of customer segments. For example, instead of spending money to market a new product to every customer in the company\u2019s database, a company can analyze which customer segment is most likely to buy the product and then market the product only on that particular segment.\n\n**attributes**\n\nID: Customer's unique identifier\nYear_Birth: Customer's birth year\nEducation: Customer's education level\nMarital_Status: Customer's marital status\nIncome: Customer's yearly household income\nKidhome: Number of children in customer's household\nTeenhome: Number of teenagers in customer's household\nDt_Customer: Date of customer's enrollment with the company\nRecency: Number of days since customer's last purchase\nComplain: 1 if customer complained in the last 2 years, 0 otherwise\nProducts\n\nMntWines: Amount spent on wine in last 2 years\nMntFruits: Amount spent on fruits in last 2 years\nMntMeatProducts: Amount spent on meat in last 2 years\nMntFishProducts: Amount spent on fish in last 2 years\nMntSweetProducts: Amount spent on sweets in last 2 years\nMntGoldProds: Amount spent on gold in last 2 years\nPromotion\n\nNumDealsPurchases: Number of purchases made with a discount\nAcceptedCmp1: 1 if customer accepted the offer in the 1st campaign, 0 otherwise\nAcceptedCmp2: 1 if customer accepted the offer in the 2nd campaign, 0 otherwise\nAcceptedCmp3: 1 if customer accepted the offer in the 3rd campaign, 0 otherwise\nAcceptedCmp4: 1 if customer accepted the offer in the 4th campaign, 0 otherwise\nAcceptedCmp5: 1 if customer accepted the offer in the 5th campaign, 0 otherwise\nResponse: 1 if customer accepted the offer in the last campaign, 0 otherwise\nPlace\n\nNumWebPurchases: Number of purchases made through the company\u2019s web site\nNumCatalogPurchases: Number of purchases made using a catalogue\nNumStorePurchases: Number of purchases made directly in stores\nNumWebVisitsMonth: Number of visits to company\u2019s web site in the last month\n","36e1820d":"**relationship between numwebvisitsmonth and numwebpurchases**\n\ninsight - most of the time people don't buy anything when they visit your website and many people visit the website on an average of 6 and buy an average of 7 products","a2a72d76":"**realtionship between sweet products and marital status**\n\ninsights- people who are alone spend much less on sweetproducts other than widows who spend more on sweetproducts","a7be9378":"**relationship between meat products and marital status**\n\ninsights - people who are alone spend less on meat products and people  who are absurd spend more on it","dc960a01":"**checking for null values**","f7dea8bd":"**relationship between wine products and marital status**\n\ninsights - all people spend relatively equal on wine except alone people who spend much less on it","2ba94e01":"**distribution of acceptedcmp1**","c28b5c25":"**relationship between fishproducts and marital status**\n\ninsights - people who are absurd spend more on fishproducts","f095ba8c":"**distribution of marital status in customers**","02b97e5c":"**distribution of acceptedcmp3**","e0ef4f80":"**coorelation of data**","f854571d":"**function for making pie charts**","5110d420":"**count of numwebvisitsmonth**","d314c055":"**relationship between marital status and total purchase**\n\ninisghts - there are no such patterns which can be identified. almost all the categroies have same totalpurchases except absurd and yolo which have comparitely high purchases","ffce77c0":"# Getting a overview of data","f8b280d2":"**distribution of numdealspurchases**","f2517788":"**creating a totalpurchase column where there will be all the total purchases**"}}
