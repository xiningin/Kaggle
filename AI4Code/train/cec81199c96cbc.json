So it could be interesting to show such an information in the map as well. A simple way to do that is to color the markers depending on the cuisine of their restaurants.\n\nSo, we will draw a new map, giving the markers different colours depending on the cuisine of the restaurant:\n\n- French in blue \n- Italian in green \n- Asian in beige \n- American in red \n- Others in black \n\nTo this end, we will need to specify our Icon items. An Icon describes how the Marker looks like: i.e. its colors and if there is a pictogram inside. When not specified, as in the previous map, a standard Icon is used, i.e. a blue one, with a white circle inside.\n\n\nUseful parameters for you Icons:\n- **color** : the background color of your Marker\n- **icon_color** : the color of the pictogram inside the Marker\n- **icon** : the pictogram ( [list of available pictograms](https:\/\/fontawesome.com\/v4.7.0\/icons\/) )\n\nThe use of icons suits very well to show qualitative distinctions.","799ad8e4":"## If you are still here \n\nThank you for reading. I hope you enjoined this tutorial, and learned from it. If something is unclear, unaccurate, if there are some mispellings, or if you want me to go deeper on some points, please tell me in the comment section.","c9a4c75b":"### Circles\n\nAnother interesting item is the circle. It does not differ that much from Markers. It exists in two forms: Circle and CircleMarker. The main difference is that the radius is expressed in meters for Circle, whereas it is expressed in pixels for CircleMarkers. Thus, Circles can be zoomed or unzoomed, whereas CircleMarkers keep the same size on screen, no matter the zoom. The main advantage of circles is that we can play with their radius. This is much appreciated to express quantitative values.\n\n\nUseful parameters for you Circles and CircleMarkers:\n\n- **location** : never forget it ;-)\n- **popup** : same as for Markers\n- **radius** : radius of the circle\n- **color** : color of the circle\n- **fill** : True if you also want color inside the circle\n\nAs an illustration, we will use a dataset about Italian earthquakes.","f7018be1":"The aim of this notebook will be to provide you a good overview of how you can use folium to draw nice maps.\nYou can also find the official documentation [there](https:\/\/python-visualization.github.io\/folium\/).\n\nCreating a folium map is a two-steps process:\nFirst, you have to setup your map, the *backgound*. Then, you can add all the elements you want, mainly your data.\n\nThis tuto will be divided as follows:\n* [Maps](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/anthaus\/tuto-draw-nice-maps-with-folium#Maps)\n    * [Zoom](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/anthaus\/tuto-draw-nice-maps-with-folium#Zoom)\n    * [Tiles](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/anthaus\/tuto-draw-nice-maps-with-folium#Tiles)\n* [Points of interest](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/anthaus\/tuto-draw-nice-maps-with-folium#Points%20of%20interest)\n    * [Markers](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/anthaus\/tuto-draw-nice-maps-with-folium#Markers)\n    * [Circles](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/anthaus\/tuto-draw-nice-maps-with-folium#Circles)\n    * [PolyLines](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/anthaus\/tuto-draw-nice-maps-with-folium#PolyLines)\n    \nFolium also provides ways to draw choropleth maps, but it is quite different, and harder to master, so I decided to let it apart for a further tutorial.","db80de55":"### PolyLines\n\nWith folium, it is also possible to draw lines between points. This can be used to draw something, but especially for locations tracking. \n\nUseful parameters:\n- **locations**: please note the plurals. Here, locations should be provided as a sorted list of tuples(latitude, longitude).\n- **popup**: label displayed while clicking.\n- **no_clip**: boolean (default is False) to enable or disable polyline clipping\n- **smooth_factor**: How much to simplify the polyline on each zoom level. More means better performance and smoother look, and less means more accurate representation.\n\n\nAs an example, we will use a dataset on birds migration. The map will show the trajectories of two birds' round trips between Europe and Africa.\n","f77e1ef0":"## Maps\n\nThe map object will contain your draw. It is basically a map, with some specifities, where points of interest will be added.\n\nUseful parameters for your maps:\n- **location**: latitude and longitude of the center of the map\n- **zoom_start**: level of zoom of your map (details below)\n- **tiles**: graphic style of the map (details below)\n- **width, height** width and height of your map\n- **zoom_min, zoom_max**: if you want to put restriction on the zoom possibilities\n\n### Zoom ###\n\nIt is not always obvious where to center your map and how to focus your zoom. It is usually done by testing and fixing until the result is fine. The following table gives an idea of the area covered depending on the level of zoom.\n\n| Zoom level | Covered area | Example |\n| ---------- | ------------ | ------- |\n|3|World| |\n|4|Continent| |\n|5|Big country|China, USA...|\n|7|Medium country|Spain, Poland...|\n|10|Small country, megapolis|Luxembourg, Tokyo...|\n|12|Extended city|Los Angeles...|\n|13|Big city|Paris, Bruxelles...|\n|15|Medium city| |\n|18|Neighbourhood|Maximum value|\n\n\nIf you use float values for your round levels, they will be rounded to the closest integer. It is also possible to zoom and unzoom the map once it is generated.\n\n### Tiles ###\n\nTiles are the graphic style of your map. It is a way to embellish your maps, but also to give more information. First, let's take a look at the freely avaiblable tiles.\n\n| Tile's name | Description |\n| ----------- | ----------- |\n|OpenStreetMap|Same maps as the one in www.openstreetmap.org and default value.|\n|Stamen Terrain|Color varies depending on height and type of terrain.|\n|Stamen Toner|Black & White. Water and frontiers are in black, terrains in white.|\n|Stamen Watercolor|Terrains in red tones, water in blue tones. Looks like if it was drawn on carton.|\n|CartoDB positron|Light map with light colors.|\n|CartoDB dark_matter|Light map with dark colors.|\n\nThe tiles' choice depends on your sensibility, but also in what you want to show. If the kind of terrain is important, then a *Stamen Terrain* will be an interesting choice. If you have a lot of elements to add, with many colors, a lighter map, with *Stamen Toner* or *CartoDB positron*  will probably be easier to read. We will use various tiles as examples in this tutorial.\nYou can find more tiles using the good API.","c3852469":"## Points of Interest\n\nThere are different way to build points of interest (*PoI*). We will present some of them below. The process is always the same: we build our *PoI* one by one (usually by looping over the data) and add them to the map with the *add_to(map)* function.\n\n### Markers\n\nMarkers are probably the most basic way to indicate some point of interest on a folium map.\nWe will illustrate it with a dataset of 3-stars Michelin restaurants of 2019.\n\n\nUseful parameters for your Markers:\n- **location** : latitude and longitude of the elements. It is an essential parameter.\n- **popup** : label for your Marker, that you can read by clicking on the Marker on the map.\n- **icon** : *pictogram* of the Marker (more details below)"}}
