Schools that participate in the program can use the new money to help students and teachers access the internet at home.\n\nThe bill temporarily expands direct payments to families by boosting the amount from USD 2,000 per child to USD 3,000 (or USD 3,600 for children under the age of 6). It also makes very low-income families eligible for this program for the first time. The bill also provides direct payments of USD 1,400 to most individuals, and extends increases in unemployment benefits. Combined, these measures are projected to reduce the share of children who fall below the federal poverty line (which is set at USD 26,500 for a family of four) \u2014 from 13.7% to 6.5%.

This article focused on the fact that the world was forced to change the way it educates students in the wake of the COV19 pandemic. Out of necessity, most learning establishments have moved to online learning because face-to-face learning is not feasible when students and teachers alike are required to comply with social distancing measures.\n\nAccessibility, affordability, flexibility, learning pedagogy, life long learning, and policy are some of the arguments related to online learning. It is said that online learning is easily accessible and can even reach rural and remote areas. It is considered to be a relatively cheaper mode of education in terms of the lower cost of transportation, accommodation, and the overall cost of institution-based learning. Flexibility is another interesting aspect of online learning, as a learner can plan their time for completion of courses available online. \n\nCombining face-to-face lectures with technology gives rise to type of hybrid learning. This type of learning environment can increase the learning potential of the students because they can learn anytime and anywhere, thereby developing new skills in the process leading to life-long learning.

This change in learning methods was primarily focused on converting traditional face-to-face in person lectures to digital online training on most, if not all, courses.\n\nThere are three types of student engagement, being learner to learner, learner to instructor, and learner to content.\n\nLearner to learner engagements involves access to other students through means such asonline discussion boards. When students are allowed to communicate with each other it gives them a feeling of inclusion so they have the opportunity to learn experiementally.\n\nLearner to instructor engagement involves the communication the student has with the course instructor and is the key point as to whether the student gains a sense of belonging and will potentially do well in the course.\n\nLearning to course content engagement involves the time the student spends looking at the course material, such as textbooks, video, audio and interactive games. It goes without saying that the more time a student spends studying the course material and working on lesson assignments, the greater his propensity to succeed in the learning environment.\n\nFindings suggest that students and faculty both agreed on the three types of engagement. In order to build the best couse in a post_COV19 environment, all three methods of engagement need to be incorporated into the lesson plan.\n\n","71ed7329":"Count localities","d5be9cbd":"Google and Microsoft are the two companies that provide the most educational serves to the states covered in the data given.","d65930d9":"Function to split multiple values to different rows for Sector(s)","2a046479":"The PSF Main Category is initially LC, followed by CM, LCO, and finally LC\/CM\/SDO.","db3a710e":"Extract subcategories of PEF","783fcb4c":"Plot PSF","9bffe93f":"Plot distribution of locale","4f7878f8":"Read","4040afa2":"Problem Statement\n\nThe COVID-19 Pandemic has disrupted learning for more than 56 million students in the United States.

Exclusive research shows drop in connectivity is impacting rural and urban areas with populations already underserved by the medical system or racked with poverty.\n\nWith most of the country on lockdown and millions relying on the internet for work, healthcare, education and shopping, research by M-Lab, an open source project which monitors global internet performance, showed that internet service slowed across the country after the lockdowns\n\nIn March 2020, most people in 62% of counties across the US did not have the government\u2019s minimum download speed for broadband internet, according to M-Lab. Those communities that are underserved are not going to be able to transition to an online workplace or school environment.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission (FCC) says 21 million Americans lack high-speed internet access but other studies have estimated the number at close to 42 million. To address that gap in connectivity, students without access to internet have been forced to roam their home towns looking for open wifi networks. Facing a remote learning crisis, some school districts are paying for their students\u2019 internet to make remote learning possible.\n\nThe statistics presented in this competition only covered 23 states, which is less than half of the 50 US states.

It is for that reason that schools should use the funding they receive to issie laptop computers to those children whose parents cannot afford to buy one, and this should be a means tested benefit.\n\nI believe that the best way to move forward with regard to education is to have a hybrid arrangement. Some of the courses will be taught on line while a few others will be given face to face. \n\nWith so many courses being taught online, there needs to be a mechanism for students to mix with other students, and these events could very well be aligned with the face to face lessons.","dea98aa1":"Check for null values","9f77a88c":"Percentage of free or reduced meals","0ddd8b4e":"OECD's publication\nsee:- https:\/\/www.oecd.org\/education\/the-impact-of-covid-19-on-education-insights-education-at-a-glance-2020.pdf\n\nThe Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development has published a paper, entitled \"The Impact of COV!( on Education Insights: Education at a Glance 2020\", that is well worth reading to gain insight on how the process of education has been affected since the COV19 outbreak. \n\nThe highlights of this paper illustrate what efforts countries have made to continue to educate their population despite the severe restrictions imposed by lockdowns:-\n\nCountries used remote learning, such as radio and television education, instructional packages, and online instructional resources.\n\nOnline education consisted of:- educational content, virtual lessons, online support for parents and pupils, and self-paced formalised lessons.\n\nTeachers have played a critical role in the education process:-\n\n- 60% of teachers received ICT training.\n\n- 18% of teachers reported a higher need for ICT training.\n\n- 36% of teachers reported participating in online courses or siminars.\n\n- Teachers are not relying heavily on distance learning for their development.","8345594c":"The sectors covered were primarily PreK to 12, followed by Higher Ed, and lastly thr Corporate sector.","81215e60":"What is the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on online and distance learning, and how might this also evolve in the future?\n\nsee:- https:\/\/www.oecd.org\/coronavirus\/policy-responses\/strengthening-online-learning-when-schools-are-closed-the-role-of-families-and-teachers-in-supporting-students-during-the-covid-19-crisis-c4ecba6c\/\n\nThe Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development has written a policy brief on their website, which is worth looking at:-\n\nThe COVID-19 crisis has forced education systems worldwide to find alternatives to face-to-face instruction. As a result, online teaching and learning have been used by teachers and students on an unprecedented scale.\n\nThe findings of the OECD include the following statements:-\n\nThe COVID-19 crisis has obliged most education systems to adopt alternatives to face-to-face teaching and learning. Many education systems moved activities online, to allow instruction to continue despite school closures. \n\nThere are concerns that online learning may have been a sub-optimal substitute for face-to-face instruction, especially so in the absence of universal access to infrastructure (hardware and software) and lack of adequate preparation among teachers and students for the unique demands that online teaching learning pose.\n\nStudents\u2019 attitudes and dispositions are influenced to a great degree by the support they receive from families and teachers and by the role models they are exposed to. Different forms of support from families and teachers, including parental emotional support and teacher enthusiasm, are found to be important for the development of positive attitudes towards learning and can ensure that students acquire the attitudes and dispositions that can maximise their ability to make the most of online learning opportunities.\n\nThe recommendations of the OECD include:-\n\nEducation systems should aim to strengthen engagement between schools and parents in order to improve information and guidance to parents on effective practices for supporting their children\u2019s learning. At the same time, teachers need support to incorporate technology effectively into their teaching practices and methods and help students overcome some of the difficulties that are associated with this form of learning environment.\n\n","18341f43":"Split PEF into PSF Main Category","c5141e88":"Import","bc58418a":"Graph Primary Essential Function","6e37af7e":"The locale is initially Suburb, followed by Rural, City, and then Town.","9c78d214":"Impute null values","ee9620d1":"Count state"}}
