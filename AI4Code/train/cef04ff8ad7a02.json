This means that women are getting funded and work on their projects in their countries (most of them are under developed or developing countries).\n\nFor loans with multiple borrowers, there are a lot more female borrower groups than mixed or multiple male groups.\n\nAs per my previous two graphs (5.1 and 5.2 graphs), total loan amount and number of loans requested are mostly Philippines. However, most of the applicants who got loans in Philippines are females compared to males.\n\nIn case of males, united states and Kenya got more loans. However in case of multiple females, the paraguay females got more loans.","c93cadeb":"## Conclusion\nPilippines is one of the countries which requested for more loans.\n\nThere are several african countries are in the list such as Kenya, Mali, Nigeria, Ghana etc involved in this loans.\n\nNo europian coutries are involved in this loans\n\nSurprisingly, USA was also present in this list, as it doesn't have the same poverty rate as the developing countries but it can be a specific case\n\nAccording to the graph top 10 countries loan applications are from mostly by developing countries.","aed2aff0":"Rate of success is important feature to the gender dependency of loan application so I calculated the rate of sucess by dividing the funded amount with loan amount.","a3c362f3":"# Data Preparation\n## checking for the missing data","1578a4b4":"In above two graphs, I checked wheather the total number of loans requested are depended on total amount of loan requested. It is clear that mostly developing countries are depending on each other.\n\nNow I want to check weather gender dependancy is present on the total amount of loans per country\n\nIn order to answer this I grouped based on the country and gender and colculated the total funded amount.","e6fb47af":"## Loan success rate is on gender dependancy\n\nI conditionally added a new column based on the rate of success column. I setup the condition that less than 70% means low success rate, greater than or equal to 95% means high success rate and between 70% and 94% moderate success rate.","3e54b00b":"#  Data visualization\u00b6\n\n##   Number of loans requested per country \noverview of countries where the most loan requests are mostly coming from.","d4d83c27":"# Activities, sectors and funding amounts by females\n\n## Females vs Sectors\n\nNow let's have a look how females are using these loans for. First I plot with sectors. There were 15 unique sectors.","a63a9e1c":"## Checking for the presence of unique values in each column ","67362a5d":"## Identification of features","c0c9a49f":"While the Phlippines still leads in request for total loan amount, I also see the US and some areas in South America have more total loan amount requests than other countries.\n\nExcept Philippines all other Asian counties applied for less amount of loans. In Africa, Kenya applied for more funding. In South America, Peru and Paraguay applied for more funding.\n\nIn USA, number of loans requested is less but total amount requested per country is more\n\nIn most of the cases, total loan amount is depend on country number of loans requested in developing countries.","6d1f4fff":"## Conclusion\n\nMost of the activities are all about basic daily needs or small businesses like buying and reselling etc.\n\nGeneral stores is one of the activities which comes in top, in developing countries most of the females choose this as a first option so this activity makes more sense in the graph. \n\nThis plot also confirms the previous findings, activities related to agriculture come in top position: Farming, Food production, pigs etc.","3acb1e0a":"## Conclusion\n\nThe most dominant sector females are spending on agriculture. This really surprises me because in most of the countries males concentrate on agriculture compared to females. \n\nFrom the graph(5.3b) it is clear that females has high chances to get a loan than males.It could be reason that loans are applying on female names but agriculture job could be done by males in there households.\n\nFood sector and retails sector occupies an important part too because many people are looking to buy fish, vegetables and stocks for their businesses to keep running.","fdb90e4d":"## Gender dependancy on total amount of loans per country","8a8c641c":"## Conclusion\n\nBased on this graph, the female has high success rate to get the loans compared to men. If it is more than one female the sucess rate of getting loan is very high. This seems to be there are somehow encouraging women to do some work. In most of the developing countries or under developed countries they always provide some reservations or subsidies for the women for the loans. This might be the reason why female has high success rate to get loans compared to male.\n","4d0e6301":"## Adding a new column 'Gender'\n\nI want to simplify the 'borrower_gender' column to male, female, multiple female, multiple male, both and uknown so that it is easy to performn further analysis","656b75b8":"## Statistical Overview of the Data\n","9631cd8f":"# Total loan amount requested per country \n\nFeatures are grouped based on country and calculated the mean and count for the loan amount.Let us have a look wheather number of loans requested per country is similar for the total loan amount requested.
