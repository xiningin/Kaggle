Does age has an effect on survival chance?

If one goes up, the other will go up. In contrary, a negative 1 means the relationship that exists between two variables is negative 100% of the time. \n- For this study, we observed a weak negative correlation between age and survived and age and death. We see a negative correlation coefficient of approximately -0.281 when comparing age with number of patients that survived. Looking into the square of the correlation coefficient, R-squared, which represents the degree or extent to which the variance of one variable is related to the variance of the second variable, and is typically expressed in percentage terms, we observed a value of approximately 0.0790. This value shows that 7.9% of the variation in survived counts can be explained by age. A value of approximately 7% is observed when comparing death count and age.\n- Hence, we can say that age has no correlation with survivial rates.\n","3cb3e0ee":"## Correlation between age and survivial rate","4ea5644d":"## **Summary from diagram**\n### What we can see from here:\n- We will just need to look into the histograms for each variable that are linked to survival rates (age, nodes and year).\n- For age, we observed people from the age of 30 to 40 has better survival rates. People from the age of 50 to 60 had a lower chance of survival while those above 60 has an equal chance.\n- For year, we only observed higher survival rate between 1960 to 1963. Well, this does not tell us anything since there could changes in how data are collected or there are simply less haberman cancer patients admitted into the University of Chicago's Billings Hospital. \n- For nodes, we see a better survival rates with patients that have 2 or less positive axillary nodes. ","dbcf29e6":"# **Introduction** \n\nI will be performing exploratory data analysis on this dataset.

Although we do see significant correlation between year and survival rate, we presume that could be due to the lack of data points. \n- We observed weak negative correlation between nodes and survival rates. Although our figures have shown that survival chance has significantly improved in patients with low numbe rof positive axillary nodes, we will need more data to justify this claim. ","8a6671a3":"## Boxplot\n\nBoxplot is also a great way to represent the distribution of qualitative data. What we see here is that people who survived have a range of 0-7 nodes, while those that died have 0-25 nodes. ","404829e9":"As we compare year with survivial rates, we observed negative correlation once again, similar to what was seen when compared to age. R-squared values of 0.144 and 0.406 were observed for death and survived counts. This means that 14% of the variation in death counts were related to the year while approximately 41% of the variation in survived count were related to year.\n- As compared to year, we see higher negative correlation values. Is this something that we can rely on? Well, we do observed more data points when comparing age with survival rate and the low amount of data point here could explain a higher negative correlation value."}}
