At this time I post this kernel, the organizer don't anounce how the no salt images scored. But I guess that if I no-mask-prediction to no-mask-images scores 1,0 and any-mask-prediction to no-mask-images scores 0.0. And also no-mask-prediction to any-mask-images scores 0.0.  0.38 must means 38% of public test images has no salt. \nSo this factor may makes this competition crazy!!"}}
