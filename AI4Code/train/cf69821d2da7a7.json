Now we cannot sort or give any ordering to such variables. They are also known as Nominal Variables.\n\nCategorical Features in the dataset: Sex,Embarked.\n\n**Ordinal Features:**\n\nAn ordinal variable is similar to categorical values, but the difference between them is that we can have relative ordering or sorting between the values. For eg: If we have a feature like Height with values Tall, Medium, Short, then Height is a ordinal variable. Here we can have a relative sort in the variable.\n\nOrdinal Features in the dataset: PClass\n\n**Continous Feature:**\n\nA feature is said to be continous if it can take values between any two points or between the minimum or maximum values in the features column.\n\nContinous Features in the dataset: Age\n","1cfc3d58":"### For two continuous variables make a scatter plot and color the points by a categorical variable","cb49983a":"How many Survived??","696b84c4":"We can not see a correlation between age and fare.","2d5153a2":"# Eploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Titanic suvivals Dataset","3a047db5":"\n## Analysing The Features\n\n**Sex--> Categorical Feature**"}}
