To get a better idea of this we can use a barplot to show the percentage of NAs by variable. Since we have 49 possible variables, we should ignore the variables that have 0% missing values.","3bd2c64b":"My recent understanding of datashader is that it's not so good at informing the user what the colors on the graph actually mean. In order to understand the graph you need to be able to interpret the color scheme: darker colors mean less accidents, brighter colors mean more accidents. Now if we compare our new understanding with what our bar chart from above told us we see that:\n* California does have a lot of accidents, especially the LA and SF areas\n* Florida has a lot of accidents in Miami and Tampa\n* Texas, although hard to see the outline, does have major cities with lots of accidents\n* South Carolina has an entire shade of purple, meaning more accidents\n* North Carolina appears to have a heavily dense portion of accidents\nWe can recreate the graph, and this time specify colors based on the severity of the accident. This will enable us view which parts of the states have the most severe accidents and which don't.","8640616e":"We see that California, TX, FL, SC and NC are the states with the most accidents. When graphing these we should also notice that this is the case. Since we're working with a big dataset that has roughly 3 million rows, we can use datashader to help us visualize this. Datashader is meant for visualizng large datasets of at least 100,000 rows.","1aa99caa":"Looking at the barchart, End_Lat, End_Lng, Precipitation(in), Number, Wind_Chill has a majority of values as NA. TMC and Wind_Speed as have a large portion of missing values. The remaining variables have very little to no issue with NA. Given the task is to visualize accidents across the 49 states, it might not make a huge deal that we have many NAs in some of these variables. If we plan on building a model for to predict severity of the accidents then some of these variables will need to be excluded or handled in another way. We are given the coordinates of the accidents, which have no missing values and that is what's going to help us visualize this by state.","80420273":"In this graph, the background is set to white to view the severity of the crashes easier. The darker the point the more severe. The yellow points are severity = 1, orange is severity = 2, purple is severity = 3, and the dark bluegreen. is severity = 4. In general, most crashes are severity = 2. There are some visible 3 and 4 spottings if we zoom into the graph. We can check this by aggregating the dataset. It's also notable that the Michigan area has a lot of severity 3 crashes as does most of the east coast whereas other areas of the graph this is not so visible."}}
