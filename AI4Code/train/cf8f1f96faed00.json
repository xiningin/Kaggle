I hope it can serve as a useful tutorial for fellow kagglers.\nWhy use Pytorch-Lightning ?\n\nPytorch lighntning is designed to help you easily follow a pytorch based training loop and ease modifications that you may want. Want to use a new scheduler ? Then simply modify the configure_optimizer method ! The beauty of it is that it automates all the boring stuff that clogs a pure pytorch code. All these loops, .zero_grad(), .eval(), torch.save etc. are gone and handled by the framework. You just have to focus on the ML part of it. The best things for researchers is that it comes with automated logs through tensorboard to compare your many experiments and easy switches between GPU, DataParallel, TPU mixed precision etc. Obviously kaggle is not very friendly with logs so I suggest reproducing the code of this kernel in a local environment and use tensorboard there.\n\nYou may ask why not simply use fastai. This is now a matter of preference. Fastai automates a lot of stuff with best practices like .fit_one_cycle. But on the other hand unless you have a lot of experience with it I find it rather opaque in what is happening behind the scenes. It's a framework designed to go with doing the fastai course so that you understand the options. If like me you learnt deep learning in a more academic environment in pure pytorch or pure tensorflow then you may find fastai hard to understand without listening to J. Howard courses. Similarly as soon as you want to do something a bit different it can become hard to understand how to change anything. On a personal note, I'll wait for the fastai v2 course before delving into it.\n"}}
