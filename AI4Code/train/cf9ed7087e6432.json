We could do it using Some librarys of Python.SweetViz is one of them.It's fast!! And it gives EDA of the whole dataset within a few seconds. Sweetviz is an open source Python library that generates beautiful, high-density visualizations to kickstart EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) with a single line of code. Output is a fully self-contained HTML application.The system is built around quickly visualizing target values and comparing datasets. Its goal is to help quick analysis of target characteristics, training vs testing data, and other such data characterization tasks.**","155a06ab":"There are 3 main functions for creating reports in SweetViz:<\/br>\n\n1.analyze(...)\n\n2.compare(...)\n\n3.compare_intra(...)"}}
