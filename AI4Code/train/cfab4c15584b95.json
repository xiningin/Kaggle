decade. However, the term 'Data Science' has only been around since the the early 2000s and in recent years, there have been an increase in the discuss around Data Science and more people seem to be venturing into the field. \n\nThe Harvard Business Review in an article publiched in 2012 describes Data Science as the sexiest job of the 21st century. In 2017, Harvard Data Science Initiative was launched to better harness the power of data sources in research. This was followed by the institution of learning releasing online Data Science courses and then starting a MSC program in the field in 2018. Aside postulations of increased entry into the Data Science field, these steps taken by Harvard goes to show that there are new opportunities for people to study and earn Data Science degrees which further enhances its attractiveness.\n\nKaggle has conducted an annual survey of the Data Science and ML community since 2017. Since Millennials are the largest generation and it is often said that they make up for the majority of the total workforce, there is a likelihood that majority of newbies in the data science community are millennials.\n\nThis notebook seeks to explore **age** from the generational perspective.\n\nIn 2017, Millennials were aged between 21-36 and Generation Z were aged between 5-20. Generations before Millennials have been merged to be called 'Older generations'. Based on the survey data, the following are the three groups of generations to be considered in this notebook.\n\n### **For 2020 survey data:**\n\n**Millennials** = 25-39 years,\n**Generation Z** = 18-24 years,\n**Older generations** = 40+ years\n\n\n### **For 2017 survey data:**\n\n**Millennials** = 21-36 years,\n**Generation Z** = 18-20 years,\n**Older generations** = 36+ years","dedc9dc1":"Above chart shows a reduction in the total number of Millennials in the Data Science and Machine Learning community over the years. In the 2017 survey, over 11,000 Millennial Kagglers took part in the survey making them 83% of the total participants. However, in 2020, there is a reduction in the number of Millennials within the community. Although, Millennials still constitute the highest number of kagglers, they now make up about 43% percent of the entire community and they are not responsible for the growth in terms of numbers within the community. \n\nGeneration Z on the other hand have increased by almost 400% since 2017 also Older Generations have increased by over 200%.\n\nYes,the Data Science community has a larger percentage of Millennials but these generation is not responsible for the increase in population.","f9015554":"## **Who earns what?**","18be3845":"## **How much coding and ML experiences per generation?**","a359dfc7":"Not everyone write codes!\n\nNot everyone uses Machine Learning methods!\n\nThere are about 2000 participants belonging to Older Generations in the 2020 survey more than the 2017 survey. However, <1000 reported having 0-5 years of coding experience and almost 2000 participants in the Older generations have 5+ years of coding experience which implies that even though they might have recently joined the community, they have always written codes. Majority of Kagglers that are 40+ years have always written codes either as Data Scientists or programmers in other fields.\n\nAs expected, majority of Generation Z have between 0-2 years coding experience. 25 of Generation Z participants have up to 10-20 years experience meaning some kagglers started coding early as 14 years old or even younger. About 10% of Millennials have spent up to 10 or more years coding.\n\nRemember that there are less Millenial participants in the 2020 survey data, therefore majority of them are expected to have above 4 years of coding experience. The above graph show that majority have over 4 years coding experience but a number of them still have between 0-2 years coding experience. This actually could imply that these millennials with two years and less coding experiences were not writing codes at first but recently picked it up or there are in fact Millenial newbies in the community. \n\nFor experience in Machine Learning,it is either Kagglers are not interested in or they are not quick to pick up ML methods as soon as they start coding. For instance, the largest percentage of Millennials and Generation Z have less than one year experience with ML methods. Only 26 Generation Z Kagglers have up to 4 years experience with ML compared to the over 2000 that have above 3 years coding experience and the 32 that have 10+ years of coding experiences. For Older generations, percentage of those who do not have up to 1 year ML experience are the highest compared to how those with less than 1 year coding experience are the lowest percentage.","0fdf18f1":"## What programming language is employed by what generation?","0589e51d":"## **What generation is responsible for population growth in the ML and DS community?**","0fb1bec1":"For the Older Generations, the highest percentage have other job titles not included in the survey followed by Data Scientist, Software Engineer and Research Scientist respectively\n\nMillennials mostly work as  Data Scientist(18%), then Student(12%) and Software Engineer(11%)\n\n58% of Generation Z are students followed by 8% who work as Data Scientists. 8% Software Engineer and 7% are currently unemployed\n\nSoftware Engineer and Data Scientist job titles are consistent are consistent across all 3 generations. Percentages of Research Scientist job title are also low for Millennials and Generation Z participants.","bedfde08":"## Where do kagglers live?","ad48456f":"The map above reveals that majority of people between 18 and 24 years in the DS and ML community are from India. The tables show that in 2017, most Millennials in the community lived in United State of America and only 3% of the Generation Z population lived in India. Not only has India taken the lead with the Millenial population but also with Generation Z. \n\nWhat is India doing specially about youth and data science? \nThere seems to be a rise in the employability of Data Scientist in the country. In an article written in India times on October 7, 2020, it was reported that despite the high rate of unemployment in India, there were over 93,500 Data Science vacant jobs in the country. This could explain why many young people in an attempts to escape unemployment, are leaning towards Data Science.\n\nNepal has no records for Older Generation\n\n\nAlso, the United States of America comes next to India in the percentage of Millennials and have the highest percentage of the Older Generations of the Data Science community living there\n\n\nCurrently, Kagglers who live in India and belong to Generation Z and Millennial population make up 28% of the Data Science and Machine Learning community in those generations.","b060da14":"## What job titles are common per generation?","df48ffc0":"Every Kaggler that responded use Python programming language to code. What happened to R? Is Python superior to R for data science?","16107642":"Majority of Kagglers irrespective of their age\/generation earn below 1000 dollars per annum.\nThe higher the thousands of dollar, the lower the percentage of Kagglers. However, for Generation Z, more people earn above 500,000 dollars than those who earn between 125,000 and 150,000 dollars.\nAlso, number of years of coding experience has no influence on salary. Out of the 16 participants who earns above 500,000 dollars yearly, 2 have never written code, 4 have less than 2 years experience, 3 have 3-5 years experience and others have above 5 years coding experiences.","43c4f55c":"## What is the highest degrees obtained per generation?","f821d8ae":"## Conclusion\n\nGenerational gaps are major issues in the world of works. People believe experiences in the workplace differ from one generation to the other but perhaps these generational gaps do not influence experiences among technological savvy populations afterall.\nMillennials became the largest generation in the US labour force in 2016 and Purdue University says by 2025, 75% of global workforce will be Millennials. Today, the DS and ML community consist of a higher percentage of Millennials but based on trends, one cannot say it will remain so for much longer.","d814f115":"### References\n\n1.
