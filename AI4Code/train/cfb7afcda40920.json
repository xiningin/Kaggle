pure english it has the following meaning : the practice of concealing messages or information within other non-secret text or data.\n\nHere is how one research paper describes it : \"Steganography is usually referred to as the techniques and methods that allow to hide information within an innocuous-like cover object. The resulting stego-object resembles, as much as possible, the original cover object. Therefore it can be sent over an unsecured communication channel that may be subject to wiretapping by an eavesdropper\"\n\nIn context to this competition it mean hiding information in the digital image.The same technology employed for digital watermarking and for digital markings\/copyrights .But it's not limited to it , anyone can use it hide information , to bypass securities , contact specific person, send malicious content ,etc .Now you see right , why I was talking about all the spy work.\n\nNowadays, steganography has been mostly developed for digital images because of their massive presence over the\nInternet, the universally adopted JPEG compression scheme and\nits relative simplicity to be modified\n\n## Difference B\/w steganalysis and steganography\n\nSteganography is the encoding of information on a viable object source and steganography is the decoding of information from the encoded object.","acb65c06":"# Data Exploration\n\nNow that we are familiar to the techniques of steganograhy , we can now move to exploration of data and steganalysis part","0169c99b":"# What happened to the Knaive approach\nI have made this notebook new again from scratch , as for my knaive approach to this problem i.e approaching this as regreesion problem based on Pixel Difference, I have added it here if you want to know about it here: https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/tanulsingh077\/creating-labels-for-steganalysis\/\n\n# New and Improved Approach\nSo now we have got to approache for model building :-\n* Use pixels as input of our neural nets as we were doing uptill now and we can also use naive method\n                                             or\n* Use DCT coeff's instead of pixel values as an input to our neural networks for prediction of labels\n\n\nIn this section we will and try and determine what would be a good idea (What you think about it, let's discuss in the comments)","ae052161":"### Let'se First go and see how we can visualize different Channels of a YCbCr colorspace Image","f0df0e3e":"* So we can see that we can find whether an information is hidden or not using a naive approach without much efforts .\n* **I  tried to use this knaive with the main dataset , but was made aware by the organizers that this knaive approach is not wrong but not exactly right because the information is hidden in the DCT coefficients of the image rather than the RGB pixels** \n\n* Don't worry if all of this does not make sense, we will look into everything , but first look at some visualizations","60923cc9":"I have added few png images , you can add yours and play around","ca35ba60":"## Fun Exercise\nBefore we begin with the original dataset and the problem of steganoanalysis, let's first try to perform steganography just for fun, using a python module called stegano and after doing steganography, we will understand how it was done.\n\nMore can be read here from docs [here](https:\/\/stegano.readthedocs.io\/en\/latest\/module\/)","f1c75e5f":"**Surpised?

The following presents a knaive approach :\n\n\n* An RGB image is stored in a form of a 3-D numpy array where each dimensions contains pixels of Red,Green and blue colors.The values in this vary between 0 and 255. We can flatten the numpy array into a vaactor of rdim x gdim x bdim . This will get us a feature vector for an img\n* Now we can find the cosine similarity between the two vectors of our normal image and encoded image, if they are alike then cosine dissimilarity(1-similarity) must be one else it will be less than 1 and we can get an idea that's something is wrong\n\nLet's do this exercise and see the results","ac99653a":"Usage and review of the Library can be viewed [here](https:\/\/github.com\/dwgoon\/jpegio)\n* The attribute coeff_arrays gives the DCT coeffs of all the three channels of YCbCr of the images , Let's go and plot DCT coeffs of Cover and Encoded Image and try to see if there is any difference","eaff954a":"### So we can see the text that we hid, But What's going on under the hood?\n\nThe module uses a technique that create a covert channel in the parts of the cover image in which changes are likely to be a bit scant when compared to the human visual system (HVS).It hides the information in the least significant bit (LSB) of the image data . This embedding method is basically based on the fact that the least significant bits in an image can be thought of as random noise, and consequently they become not responsive to any changes on the image <br>\n\nThis is one of the first and classical ways of doing stegnagraphy on images .The well-known steganographic tools based on LSB embedding are different as far as the way they hide information is concerned. Some of them change the LSB of pixels randomly, others modify pixels not in the whole image but in selected areas of it, and still others increase or decrease the pixel value of the LSB, rather than change the value","951e547d":"So the organizers have used four algorithms for encoding data into the cover images, they are [JUNIWARD , JMiPOD, UERD] \n* UNIWARD -  Universal Wavelet Relative Distortion<br>\nPaper describing CNN for stegnalysis of [JUNIWARD images](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/ftp\/arxiv\/papers\/1704\/1704.08378.pdf)\n \n* JMiPOD -\n Paper describing CNN for stegnalysis of [JMiPOD images](https:\/\/hal-utt.archives-ouvertes.fr\/hal-02542075\/file\/J_MiPOD_vPub.pdf)\n \n* UERD - Uniform Embedding Revisited Distortion\n<br> No resources found yet , I will update as soon as I find something\n\nFor now just assume they are certain algorithms that are used for encoding data into image we will understand everything in a bit","95d47c6c":"Now let's explore the Different channels of YCbCr of Cover and Encoded Image side by side","7c13ad4b":"Let's first verify our argument that cosine similarity is 1 for exact same vectors","3782b524":"We just hid a message in our image with two lines of code , Cool huh? <br>\nLet's try looking at the image to observe if there is any difference","f8f49eec":"Up untill now we were using difference in pixel values and normal pixel values for analysis and it has been argued that's it is not the right way \nLets now look at difference in DCT values and difference in pixels and see the differences, this will help us to make better  decision ","ba0441b4":"# What's Next\n\n* Building a baseline with pixel difference and my naive way as I have discussed in 8th version of my notebook \n* Building a baseline with pixel value only and with DCT values and seeing which works better\n* After deciding the approach using SOTA models for perfections\n* More insights that would help us\n\nIf you have read this kernel , do share your  thoughts on which would be a better way to model in the comments below\n\nSTAY TUNED !!!","098d51c3":"# Had we been doing it all wrong?\n\n1)**We will understand everything step by step one at a time , so let's start with what is 'JPEG'?**\n\nSo JPEG is not a file format , it's a compressing algorithm for an image file to reduce it's size , without losing a lot of information.
