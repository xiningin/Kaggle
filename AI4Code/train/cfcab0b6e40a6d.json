It is targeted at anyone just starting out with this competition. You need no prior knowledge of steganography to understand this kernel\n\n\n# Basics\nFirst up, let us understand the basics of [steganogarphy](https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/steganography-hacker-lexicon\/). \n* ***Definition:*** Steganography is essentially the practice of hiding secret messages in an otherwise non-secret medium. It has existed for centuries in different forms.\n* ***Current:*** Modern day steganography (including this competition) deals with encoding secret information in digital images. How is this done:\n    * The pixel values are altered to store hidden messages (henceforth called the payload).\n    * However, the altered & original image does **not** show any visual difference to the naked eye. \n* ***Techniques:*** Now, different algorithms can be used to encode the payload (i.e., change the pixel values). This competition uses 3 algorithms:\n    1. JMiPOD\n    2. JUNIWARD\n    3. UERD\n* ***Data:*** We are given a dataset of 75k images with each image in its original unaltered state(cover) and modified by each of the 3 algorithms respectively.\n    \n* ***Objective:*** The goal of this competition  is to come up with a machine learning model to predict whether a given test image has a payload encoded or not. We are not concerend with recovering the contents of the payload.\n  * Essentially, we are dealing with one aspect of steganalysis which is the study of detecting and possibly recovering messages hidden using steganography.","d257ee21":"* As you can see above, we displayed 5 random images.\n* By mere visual observation, there is no sign of any modification to the image.\n* They look completely visually similar. \n* Lets look deeper","aa79a491":"# Display samples\nLet us load & display some random sample images from the dataset","d94a7b4b":"# Histogram analysis\nLet us plot the histogram of the images and look to comapare the images.
