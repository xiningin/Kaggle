Easily classified negatives comprise the majority of loss and dominate the gradient. Focal loss propose to reshape loss function to down weight the easy examples and thus focus training on hard negatives. Details about focal loss can be found in below paper:\nhttps:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1708.02002\n\n### Original source\nSource of original code for Multilabel Focal Loss Function is at below link. It is written using tensorflow.\nhttps:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/allunia\/rsna-ih-detection-baseline\n\n\n[@Allunia](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/allunia) Thank you for wonderful kernel. I came to know about multilabel focal loss via your kernel only.\n\n**I rewrote the function using numpy and found it was quite fast. So, sharing with the community. I hope it helps.**","d1a97dc5":"Numpy version returns result in micro seconds while tensorflow version returns in milli seconds."}}
