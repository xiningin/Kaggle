We should note that the temperatures are in Kelvin. The most important thing to notice is that there are some **problems** and **outliers**. In particular:\n- There is at least one outlier in the 'pressure' column as the maximum value is 1,008,371 hPa or approximately 100 MPa, which is roughly the pressure at the bottom of Mariana Trench about 11 km below ocean surface [[2]](#ref5). This cannot be the case here.\n- There is at least one outlier in the 'wind_speed' column as the maximum value is 133 m\/s. This measurement is close to the fastest wind speed ever recorded on Earth, caused by the 1999 Bridge Creek\u2013Moore tornado [[3]](#ref6), a F5 (the largest intensity of the Fujita scale) tornado [[4]](#ref7). A tornado of such intensity has not been recorded in Spain [[5]](#ref9) and hopefully will not happen in the future as well. \n- The 'rain_3h' column is supposed to provide information about the precipitation (i.e. rain) of the last 3 hours in mm. Since the 'rain_1h' column is supposed to provide the same information but about just the last hour, it would be logical to assume that its mean would be less than that of 'rain_3h'.

In recent decades however, electricity has entered the market as a tradeable commodity and the power industry of many countries has been **deregulated**. In Spain, the Electric Power Act 54\/1997 exposed all of the stakeholders to **high amounts of uncertainty** as the price of electricity is determined by countless factors and also, due to the fact that electricity cannot be stored in large quantities efficiently [[1]](#ref1). With the emergence of this new market, the need for reliable forecasting methods at all scales (hourly, daily, long-term, etc.) has also emerged and has become a large area of research.\n\nThe goal of this kernel is to compare different **deep neural network architectures** (+XGBoost) on the task of **predicting the next hour's electricity price** by using the past values of the electricity price as well as those of another features related to energy generation and weather conditions. Furthermore, the kernel contains a meticulous *exploration and cleaning* of the data, *time series analysis* of the electricity price and careful *feature engineering*. With further research and development (e.g. as a forecasting model which is updated in real-time) a similar approach could possibly prove useful to all the stakeholders (electric power companies, investors, etc.) involved in energy markets. For the time being, I believe that this kernel can serve as a **future reference** for aspiring data scientists, as it contains an *end-to-end time series forecasting project* and demonstrates the -minimum- level of immersion that a dataset needs in order to turn into something which is actually applicable in the real world.\n\nIn the **original project**, which was conducted for a postgraduate course, I compared the performance (using the Root Mean Squared Error as the performance metric) of 5 different architectures (LSTM, stacked LSTM, CNN, CNN-LSTM and Time Distributed MLP) for both univariate and multivariate forecasting (i.e. using only the previous time-steps of the electricity price vs. also using other features) using a different number of previous time-steps as the features for the models (3, 10 and 25 previous time-steps for all the used features). In **this particular kernel**, you will find an application of all the aforementioned deep learning architecures, as well as two more approaches: the *Encoder-Decoder* architecure and the *XGBoost regressor*. Furthermore, in all these applications, I use the 25 previous time-steps of all the features (multivariate forecasting) that have been extracted or generated, after applying *PCA (Principal Component Analysis)*. The **Adam optimizer** is used in all the deep learning architectures and, in order to choose its learning rate, I originally conducted preliminary tests using the the *learning rate scheduler* callback starting from a learning rate equal to 0.0001 and gradually increasing it by a factor of 10 every 10 epochs; a step which is omitted in this kernel.\n","49e8dcde":"## <a id='ref4'>1.2.

Note that **the R\u00b2 values of these two are not comparable** because we have first encoded them; in order to actually calculate the similarity between two strings, we need to employ a different metric such as the *Levenshtein distance*, i.e. the number of edits required to transform string A to string B.
