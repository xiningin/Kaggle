If the condition is true at a split, then we move down and to the left branch.  If it is false, then we move to the right branch.\n\nFor instance, consider an applicant in Group B, who has an income of 75k.  Then, \n- We start at the top of the flow chart.  the applicant has an income of 75k, so `Income <= 80210.5` is true, and we move to the left.\n- Next, we check the income again. Since `Income <= 71909.5` is false, we move to the right.\n- The last thing to check is what group the applicant belongs to.  The applicant belongs to Group B, so `Group <= 0.5` is false, and we move to the right, where the model has decided to approve the applicant.\n\n# 2) Understand the baseline model\n\nBased on the visualization, how can you explain one source of unfairness in the model?\n\n**Hint**: Consider the example applicant, but change the group membership from Group B to Group A (leaving all other characteristics the same).  Is this slightly different applicant approved or denied by the model?","7803644f":"This is only a short exercise to explore different types of fairness, and to illustrate the tradeoff that can occur when you optimize for one type of fairness over another.  We have focused on model training here, but in practice, to really mitigate bias, or to make ML systems fair, we need to take a close look at every step in the process, from data collection to releasing a final product to users. \n\nFor instance, if you take a close look at the data, you'll notice that on average, individuals from Group B tend to have higher income than individuals from Group A, and are also more likely to own a home or a car.  Knowing this will prove invaluable to deciding what fairness criterion you should use, and to inform ways to achieve fairness.  (*For instance, it would likely be a bad aproach, if you did not remove the historical bias in the data and then train the model to get equal accuracy for each group.*)\n\nIn this course, we intentionally avoid taking an opinionated stance on how exactly to minimize bias and ensure fairness in specific projects.  This is because the correct answers continue to evolve, since AI fairness is an active area of research.  This lesson was a hands-on introduction to the topic, and you can continue your learning by reading blog posts from the [Partnership on AI](https:\/\/www.partnershiponai.org\/research-lander\/) or by following conferences like the [ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (ACM FAccT)](https:\/\/facctconference.org\/).","29e225b4":"# 1) Varieties of fairness\n\nConsider three different types of fairness covered in the tutorial:\n- **Demographic parity**: Which group has an unfair advantage, with more representation in the group of approved applicants?

In this exercise, you'll train a few models to approve (or deny) credit card applications and analyze fairness.  Don't worry if you're new to coding: this exercise assumes no programming knowledge.\n\n# Introduction\n\nWe work with a **synthetic** dataset of information submitted by credit card applicants. \n\nTo load and preview the data, run the next code cell.  When the code finishes running, you should see a message saying the data was successfully loaded, along with a preview of the first five rows of the data.","b98e5f5b":" The dataset contains, for each applicant:\n- income (in the `Income` column),\n- the number of children (in the `Num_Children` column),\n- whether the applicant owns a car (in the `Own_Car` column, the value is `1` if the applicant owns a car, and is else `0`), and\n- whether the applicant owns a home (in the `Own_Housing` column, the value is `1` if the applicant owns a home, and is else `0`)\n\nWhen evaluating fairness, we'll check how the model performs for users in different groups, as identified by the `Group` column: \n- The `Group` column breaks the users into two groups (where each group corresponds to either `0` or `1`).  \n- For instance, you can think of the column as breaking the users into two different races, ethnicities, or gender groupings.  If the column breaks users into different ethnicities, `0` could correspond to a non-Hispanic user, while `1` corresponds to a Hispanic user. \n\n\nRun the next code cell without changes to train a simple model to approve or deny individuals for a credit card.
