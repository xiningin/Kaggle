It is basically scaling all the dimensions to be even so that one independent variable does not dominate another. For example, bank account balance ranges from millions to 0, whereas gender is either 0 or 1. If one of the features has a broad range of values, the distance will be governed by this particular feature. Therefore, the range of all features should be normalized so that each feature contributes approximately proportionately to the final distance.","b456cf76":"This means that we should have about $(1504 + 221) = 1726$ correct classifications out of our total testing data size of $2000$.\nThis means that our accuracy for this trial was $1726 \\div 2000 = 86.3\\%$, which matches the classifier's prediction","ef2d9dd3":"\n### If we want more than two categories, then we will need to change \n\n 1) the *units* parameter to match the desired category count\n \n 2) the *activation* field to **softmax**.
