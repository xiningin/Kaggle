I think it would be better if we plot the percentage numbers in a stacked column than the absolute numbers.

The wide variety of plots and the level of customization available give the users a high amount of control on how the chart looks. As I learn more about how to work with Plotly, I want to experiment with different chart types through kernels as a way for me to practice and also for the Kaggle community to know how to use them.\n\n## Notes about Plotly\nPlotly charts have two major components: data and layout.\n\nData - this represents the data that we are trying to plot. This informs the Plotly's plotting function of the type of plots that need to be drawn. It is basically a list of plots that should be part of the chart. Each plot within the chart is referred to as a 'trace'.\n\nLayout - this represents everything in the chart that is not data. This means the background, grids, axes, titles, fonts, etc. We can even add shapes on top of the chart and annotations to highlight certain points to the user.\n\nThe data and layout are then passed to a \"figure\" object, which is in turn passed to the plot function in Plotly.\n\n- Figure\n    - Data\n        - Traces\n    - Layout\n        - Layout options\n        \n## Bar plots\nIn a [previous notebook](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/meetnaren\/plotly-experiments-scatterplots), I had explored how to use scatterplots to examine the relationship between two continuous variables. Here, I will explore bar plots.\n\nBar (or column) plots are useful to investigate a numerical quantity across different categories. There are different variations of bar plots - individual, clustered, stacked, etc. Let us try different flavors of bar plots in this notebook.\n\n## Dataset\nI will be using the Bay Area Bike Share dataset for this notebook. The data has very interesting information on the bikes, stations and bike trips taken in the Bay Area. There are a lot of questions that we can explore through visualizations. Let us read in the dataset and import Plotly packages to start with.","625ca053":"The above chart can also be depicted through a 'waterfall' chart. Let us see how.","0a210885":"Let us see if we can highlight the weekends also, along with the subscription type.","242f0c3b":"Overall, the month-wise analysis of the no. of trips shows us that ridership tends to be low in the winter months and it tends to gradually increase from spring to summer and fall. The proportion of customer to subscriber does not seem to change much based on the month. Let us now see how the day of week affects ridership."}}
