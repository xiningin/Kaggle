We have concluded the following:\n\n#### Churn Customers:\nChurn customers tend to lean towards month-to-month contracts and opt for one or two services, paying a higher monthly average with electronic checks. Most choose the fiber optic internet service, with no online security, no online backup, no device protection, and no tech support. They also seem to mostly not have a partner or dependents.\n\n#### Potential Problems:\n- It is possible that there is a problem with the fiber optic internet service, as it has the highest churn rate of the internet services provided. It is possible that some improvements can be made to this service to reduce customer churn rates.\n- It is possible that month-to-month contracts have higher monthly charges. If this is the case, reducing the monthly charge for the month-to-month contract option would reduce customer churn rates.\n- It is possible that there is a problem wih the electronic check payment option, as it seems that it has a particularly high churn rate amongst the other options. This could be an electronic problem that could be looked into and fixed.","20e73911":"***","7ee22727":"These plots show several patterns amongst these services. Most churn customers appear to have been paying for phone service. Regarding internet service, most of the churn customers had fiber optic services.

On the other hand, in the monthly perspective, we see that the average customers churning are paying higher monthly charges. \n\nThere are a couple major factors to consider before coming to any conclusions regarding the average charges. Firstly, it would make sense that the total amount charged to the customers who churned would be lower, as they may have stayed with the company considerably less time than the costumers who stayed with the company. In this case, we would have to investigate how long each customer has been with the company, a feature not in this dataset. Secondly, in regards to the monthly charges, it could be possible that long-time customers could have had a discount. It's also possible that long-term customers pay for less services.
