It\u2019s a data mining technique that is used for mining frequent itemsets and relevant association rules.\n\nExample: Recommending products based on your purchased items. You can see this in different e-commerce websites. (Recommendation system)\n\n\n**Things that we need to know before implementation:**\n\n**Association rule:** \nIt identifies frequent patterns and associations(relations) among a set of items. Ex: If you go to buy a keyboard, you might also get a mouse. So place them aside in your market to get more profit.\n\n**Support:** \nSupport refers to the default popularity of an item and can be calculated by finding the number of transactions containing a particular item divided by total number of transactions.\n```\nSupport (Keyboard) = (Transactions containing (Keyboard)) \/ (Total Transactions))\n\n```\n**Confidence:**\nConfidence refers to the likelihood that an item B (mouse) is also bought if item A (keyboard) is bought. Like our keyboard and mouse example. \n\n`Confidence(Keyboard\u2192Mouse) = (Transactions containing both (Keyboard and Mouse))\/(Transactions containing Keyboard)`\n\n**Lift:**\nLift(Keyboard -&gt; Mouse) refers to the increase in the ratio of sale of Mouse when the Keyboard is sold. \nLift(Keyboard -&gt; Mouse) can be calculated by dividing Confidence(Keyboard\u2192Mouse) divided by Support(Mouse). \n\n```\nLift(Keyboard -&gt; Mouse) = (Confidence(Keyboard\u2192Mouse))   \/  (Support (Mouse))\n\n```\n\n\n\nReferences: \n1. https:\/\/www.geeksforgeeks.org\/apriori-algorithm\/\n2. https:\/\/stackabuse.com\/association-rule-mining-via-apriori-algorithm-in-python\/\n3. https:\/\/github.com\/AmitHasanShuvo\/Machine-Learning-Projects\/tree\/master\/Apriori%20Algorithm\n4. https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/getting-started\/157119","e64362d7":"# Code "}}
