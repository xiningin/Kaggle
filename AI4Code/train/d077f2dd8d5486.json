Geospatial data is also known as spatial data, geodata, etc. It has information connected to a dataset such as address, city, ZIP code, etc.\u00a0\n\n\n![brett-zeck-eyfMgGvo9PA-unsplash (2).jpg](attachment:7c5e04c9-5b51-43c8-b551-a46b433168d7.jpg)\n\n\nIt includes large datasets of geospatial data gleaned from many different sources in varying formats and can include information such as census data, satellite imagery, weather data, cell phone data, drawn images and social media data. It is most useful when it can be discovered, shared, analyzed and used in combination with traditional business data.\n\n## Types of geospatial data\nThere are two main types of geospatial data: vector and raster data.\n### Vector data\nVector data is best defined as graphical representations of the real world. There are three main types of vector data: points, lines, and polygons. When you connect points it create lines and when you connect lines it creates an enclosed area polygon. It is most often stored in\u00a0.shp files known as shapefiles. Vector data is scalable, has small file sizes and ideal for depicting boundaries.\n### Raster data\nRaster data is presented in a grid of pixels. Each pixel within a raster has a value, whether it be a colour or unit of measurement, to communicate information about the element in question. Rasters typically refer to imagery. However, in the spatial world, this may specifically refer to orthoimagery which are photos taken from satellites or other aerial devices. Raster data quality varies depending on resolution and your task at hand.\n\nGeospatial data has a vast number of applications in our daily life. One example is the Maps application that you use to navigate from one location to the others. Another one that you may see every day is on the weather channel. Geospatial data is used to represent position information of something with respect to other things around it: your house on the city map, the hurricane on the world map and so on.\n\n### Geopandas\nGeoPandas is an open source project to make working with geospatial data in python easier. GeoPandas extends the datatypes used by pandas to allow spatial operations on geometric types. Geometric operations are performed by shapely. Geopandas further depends on fiona for file access and matplotlib for plotting.\n\nThe goal of GeoPandas is to make working with geospatial data in python easier. It combines the capabilities of pandas and shapely, providing geospatial operations in pandas and a high-level interface to multiple geometries to shapely. GeoPandas enables you to easily do operations in python that would otherwise require a spatial database such as PostGIS.\n\n"}}
