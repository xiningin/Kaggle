It can be a frustrating part of data science, especially if you're newer to the field and don;t have a lot of experience. One of the most important question you can ask yourself to help figure this out is this:\n\n*** Is this value missing because it wasn't recorded or because it doesn't exist? ***\n\nIf a value is missing because it doesn't exist then it doesn't make sense to try and guess what it might be. These values you probabally  try to guess what it might have been based on the other values in that column and row.\n\n\n","98400fbe":"** Filling in missing values automatically **","819ff9a3":"The first thing to do is to take a look at original datasets.
