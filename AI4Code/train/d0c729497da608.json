Research and development in machine learning are expensive, and the intelligence needed to create and train the model is intimidating. Despite these difficulties, some companies are trying to invest in machine learning, because they believe that adopting machine learning lead to bigger competitive advantages. While the other companies are still fear that machine learning is out of reach for them. The degrees of machine learning utilization in the companies are different. Some companies use machine learning for only getting insights from the data and some of them create and deploy machine learning models in production. \n\n\nThis notebook will take us on a journey to **learn about the work environments** that differ in the way of adopting machine learning. We will also get to know the **skills and experiences of the companies' employees**. The notebook will benefit both *people* who want to learn more about the machine learning adoptions in work environments and the *companies* that want to start to use machine learning.\n\n\nThe notebook is organized as the following: it starts with taking a look at the dataset of Kaggle Machine Learning & Data Science Survey. Then, we will see how the companies adopt machine learning. After that, we will explore the employees' machine learning experience and skills, and the companies environments.","ff336093":"### 2.8.

As for the companies that have started using machine learning for production recently, more than 75% of their employees have more than two years of experience. Finally, companies that well establised machine learning their employees have much more years of experience in machine learning.","65917995":"From the heatmap, we can see that nearly half of the well-established machine learning companies have large data science teams of 20+.

This is could be because that the large companies have the possiblities and the resources to work in machine learning fields. As well as,the startups are looking to use machine learning to further optimize their services.","5c8cb540":"In general, the most used machine learning frameworks are Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch and Xgboost.

Moreover, over half of the participants from the companies that use machine learning for only getting insights are working as  researchers, data scientists, or data analysts.\n\nBriefly, we can say that the data scientists usually use machine learning models, but not necessarily use the models in production. If you want to work on building and deploying machine learning models, join companies that have machine learning engineer job title. Moreover, the research scientist role focuses on using machine learning for only getting insights.
