It is like vaccine producer countries can be faster, but lets look at the results!\n\n**How I did?** <br>\nAgain, because its time series data set, I created three time series plot to compare each other. Also before creation of the chart, I create two new variable to find portion of how many percentage of population vaccined. I used total vaccination numbers and fully vacinated number from vaccination data set, and divided population that is from covid10 data set. After this process, I put daily vaccinations number, vaccinated population, and fully vaccinated of population (the people who got two doses of vaccine) in row. And, I use date (daily) in column. Also, I added location as a filter, so you can easily play with data. To make simplify, I choose first four countries that are nearly first for each categories.\n\n**Results** <br>\nAccording to daily vaccination numbers in February, it looks like the USA and UK have the highest daily vaccination. On the other hand, Israel is remarkably fast than other countries, in the date of February 4, 2021, Isreal has finished nearly 60% of the population at least the first doses of vaccine and nearly 22% of its population got both two doses.<br>\nAfter Israel, United Arab Emirates also has finished nearly 40% of the population at least first doses of vaccine but its full vaccinations numbers still behind. After these countries, while the UK has finished nearly 16% of the population, the USA has finished nearly 10% of the population at least first doses of vaccine. Even if the other countries have low numbers, data is very changeable day by day.","f1a44174":"<a id = \"6\"><\/a><br>\n# Referances<br>\n[1] The New York Times, \"_Coronavirus Vaccine Tracker_\", [Online].

Firstly, to show the last picture of Covid-19 numbers, I added 'Total cases', 'Total deaths', 'New cases Smoothed' and 'New Deaths Smoothed' in rows, and daily in the column. For the location, I filtered by just choosing 'World' data. In the same way, in the below line chart, I used world data and total vaccination numbers. I also added map of total vaccination all around the world, however differences of the USA, China and rest of the world is very big, the colour of other countries cannot distinguishable.\n\n**Results** <br>\nFrom the first two line charts, it seems to be total cases and total deaths near to reach the highest level. And fortunately, the daily case numbers look like decreasing even if the number of deaths does not show the same trend, we can say that the death numbers didn't increase remarkably in the last months. The below chart, clearly shows that number of vaccinations is increasing rapidly. While the case number reach 103M in one year period, the vaccination number reach the same number in nearly two months period. As of 2 February 2021, the total cases are 103,137,905 and the total vaccinations are 105,115,442. Even if the total vaccinations still include a small portion of the world, it looks like that an important portion of the world population can be vaccinated within a year if it continue to increase with this fast.","f61eb2af":"#### How data sets look like:","a95d4ce1":"[Click for the big version of the graph.](https:\/\/public.tableau.com\/views\/World_16126333851160\/Q4?:language=en&:display_count=y&publish=yes&:origin=viz_share_link)","d2de2a28":"<a id = \"5\"><\/a><br>\n# Conclusion\n\nThere is a light at the end of the tunnel!

What is the vaccine distribution? Are there any decreases in the number of cases in the countries that begin the vaccination process?\n<br>\n \n**Why?** <br>\nAfter finding which vaccines are commonly used, the other wondering question is 'Are they really help to reduce the cases and deaths?'. Even if lots of factor affects the cases and deaths number, everyone hopes after vaccinations, the numbers will remarkably decrease. Vaccinations began in December of 2020 and the process has still continued. Even if nearly just 2 months passed after the vaccination process, I tried to compare the daily vaccinations number, which vaccines are commonly used. And also is there any clear effect on decreases number? \n\n**How I did?** <br>\nI prepared a bar chart as I mentioned above. And for the boxplot, I used each daily vaccinations in a row and date in a column. And because 2020 has lots of null values, I used just data of 2021 by filtering date. For the bottom line graph, firstly, I merged two data sets (df_vaccinations and df_covid) to use cases and death numbers. I use locations (countries) as a key. After that, I created daily base time series for daily cases and death numbers. And, to avoid noises in the time series, I used smoothed variables. These variables are prepared by getting each 7-day average period. Finally, I used vaccines as a filter, you can play with data by clicking which vaccines effect you want to see.\n\n**Results** <br>\nFirstly, I want to mention daily vaccinations. As you can see from the box-plot, all daily vaccinations numbers among 500k and 0k because most countries still have struggled to supply the vaccine. On the other hand, CNBG, Sinovac distribution looks very balanced and nearly between 500k and 1000k. The reason for that, actually is China's distribution, only China has used this combination and also both CNBG(Sinopharm) and Sinovac have been produced in China. On the other hand, Moderna, Pfizer\/BioNTech combination is widely used, so there are lots of outliers.\nThe bar graph shows that Moderna and Pfizer\/BioNTech combination is the highest commonly used vaccines. So, when we select this combination from the line chart below, we can clearly see after mid-January case numbers began to decline. Even if the death numbers have been going to stable. When I looked at each vaccine, the numbers going down or at least they are stable. So, maybe we can say that the vaccination process works for now.","918582f1":"Now, to play data in tableau, I got this file as a csv file.","aa1df3f5":"<a id = \"2\"><\/a><br>\n### Gathering Data\nData sets distributed by [Our World in Data](https:\/\/github.com\/owid\/covid-19-data\/tree\/master\/public\/data)  is publicly available.

Which country is using what vaccine or  What vaccines are used and in which countries?<br>\n\n**Why?** <br>\nIt is clear while the Covid-19 pandemic has been resuming, the last days' new vaccination process is a hot topic all around the world. And one of the most wondering topics is which country are using which vaccines.\n\n**How I did?** <br>\nAfter the data wrangling in here, I got the output of this CSV file and imported this file tableau public version. Firstly, I assigned location and iso_code variables Geographical role as a country and iso code. Then, I created a new worksheet, when I double-clicked on location, the map automatically created. Then, I put vaccines in colour and the sum of Daily Vaccinations Raw in size. Finally, I changed the colour of Vaccines to follow easier, I used blue colours for Oxford\/AstraZeneca groups, greens for Pfizer\/BioNtech, reds for Sinovac and orange for Sputnik V. And I created the bottom left bar chart in another sheet. I put locations in a row and the sum of Daily Vaccinations Raw in the column. Again I put vaccines in colour, and the same colours appeared automatically.Then, I created the bottom right bar chart using the count of countries and vaccines' names. Lastly, I created a dashboard put these three sheets in it. Then, I save the tableau public, got embedded codes of HTML to use in Kaggle.\n\n**Results** <br>\nBecause generally, countries have not used just one kind of vaccine, it is hard to find which country uses what vaccines. However, it seems lots of countries have used at least some Pfizer\/BioNTech's combinations, As you can see on the map green colours appear mostly on the map and the size of greens also bigger than others generally. Also, when we look at the right bottom graph, Pfizer\/BioNTech and combinations are using the majority of countries, especially by European and North American countries. Even if there is no country just using Moderna, Countries that have higher total vaccination numbers are using Moderna and Pfizer\/BioNTech combination like USA, Isreal, Germany. Next, maybe we can mention Oxford\/AstraZeneca, while 6 countries are using this vaccine, 9 countries are using a combination of it. Again, Countries that have higher total vaccination numbers are using Oxford\/AstraZeneca combinations like UK, India, Brazil. Followingly, Sinovac is another vaccine commonly used. The countries that have higher total vaccination numbers like China, Brazil and Turkey are using Sinovac and its combinations. If we mention Sinopharm, Egypt has been using just Sinopharm, but the vaccination number of Egypt is very low. 4 countries have been using a combination of Sinopharm and one of the countries is the United Arab Emirates the 6th of the highest vaccination number. Finally, Sputnik V has been used commonly by Russia and other 3 countries, but the numbers of it are lower than other vaccines. Also, Covaxin has been using by Just India with Oxford\/AstraZeneca.\n","265666ab":"<a id = \"4\"><\/a><br>\n# Interview the Data ","fee72afd":"### 5.

For example, I thought if getting vaccination fastly is related money, we should see clear correlation between vaccination numbers and Gdp per capita. Let's see.\n\n**How I did?**<br>\nI used 'Human Development Index', 'Population Density', 'Life Expectancy' and 'Gdp Per Capita' from the covid data set, and 'Total Vaccinations' from the vaccination data set. All explanations and sources of these variables explained 'Gathering Data' section. Creating this correlation graph quite easy in Tableau. I added the same variables both in rows and columns. Also, I made adjustments in the axis about scaling, for example, life expectancy began with zero, I changed this number with minimum life expectancy. Finally, I added locations as a filter. You can also play with countries, the result can change when you deselect the dominant country. \n\n**Results**<br>\nfor my analysis, I looked at the total vaccination row. Unfortunately, there is no clear correlation between vaccination numbers and other variables. However, vaccination numbers still include a very very small portion of the world, I quite expect that this graph will be changed while the numbers increases. When I played with locations, in some cases I realized that there's a low correlation between vaccinations and GDP per capita."}}
