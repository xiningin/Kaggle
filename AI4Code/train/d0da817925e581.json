We will basically look if the house prices are more expensive in Abbotsford than in Melbourne general. You can freely pick any other suburb or region to test.","253bfb64":"So the mean of Abbotsford house prices were 0.84 standard error units higher than the mean of the population. I preferred to synchronize to the general convention for se level of 1.645 and p value level of 0.05. Since our scores of se 0.84 < 1.645 and p value of 0.39 > 0.05, so the hypothesis of house prices in Abbotsford-Melbourne are more expensive than in Melbourne general is rejected. We can assume the houses in Abbotsford are not much more expensive than the total population, which is, Melbourne. Since standard error unit is found 49,805 (dollars), and Abbotsford house price mean is 0.84 standard error units away, 49,805 (dollars) * 0,84 = 41.836 (dollars). So that means Abbotsford mean house price is 41.836 away from the mean of Melbourne house price. \n\nWe can see the result graphs above. This is not the standardized normal distribution, so this needed to be explained. In the plotted graphs, 1.0 means 1.0 trillion dollars, and 1.1 is also 1.1 trillion dollars and from the red line which represents Abbotsford mean house prices, we can clearly see on the plot that it is deviated 41.836 (dollars).","6ac76959":"As the hypothesis are declared, it\u2019s known that Abbotsford is a district of Mel\u0002bourne. First the population mean and standard deviation and the sample\n(Abbotrsford) mean and population has been calculated.\n* Melbourne house prices mean: 997,898\n* Melbourne house prices standard deviation: 593,498\n* Abbotsford house prices mean: 1,040,200\n* Abbotsford house prices standard deviation: 374,652\n\nAfter that it\u2019s found how Abbotsford mean is diversed against the total population in manner of standard error units. The calculation result was:\n* se units: 0.84, p value: 0.39"}}
