It is a way to track the sequence of events that any child would have taken in any speicific game session. \n - As a ballmark if there are too many events may be it is not effective learning. As most of the events are when there is a prompt for not doing the right thing. For example: if i have to arrange 3 things in the right sequence based on height of the items. If i arrange it in 3 tries it is the best, but if i need some guidance, the prompt would go off and then i would need to rearrange it again...all this time the even_count would keep increasing by 1. \n - Most of the games have under 70 event_count. There is a steep fall off from the 70 mark and it keeps decreasing exponentialy -- which is to be expected\n \n**Event Code**\n- There are 42 unique codes. \n- There seems to be some concentration around key codes\n- These codes would need to be looked at with respect to the differnt activities and worlds. \n\n**Game Time**\n\n- There is a step fall off in game time.
