When a viewer comes across your video thumbnails on YouTube, it\u2019s called impressions, that is, how many times your video thumbnails are shown on YouTube. Each impression can be a \npotential chance to earn a youtube view. Clicking on a link, embedding video on blogs, youtube notifications etc don't count as a impression.\n\n**Youtube Non-Impressions views:** When a users doesn't see the full thumbnail and Title, it's counted as a Youtube Non-Impressions. However in this dataset it's defined as no of views from external sources compared to that internal sources.\n\n![Screenshot_2020-06-29%20Understanding%20your%20video%20reach%20on%20YouTube%20-%20YouTube.png](attachment:Screenshot_2020-06-29%20Understanding%20your%20video%20reach%20on%20YouTube%20-%20YouTube.png)\n\n**Youtube views**: It counts the number of times a video has been watch so far. However youtube ensures a lot of checks to see if the views are coming from humans and not from bots. To learn\nmore about youtube views [check this out](https:\/\/qr.ae\/pNKiNY)\n\n**Youtube subscribers**: This is simple again, subscribers keep track of how many people have created alerts for your page, and these people would have your newest videos near the top of their feed. There are very few better ways to measure engagement than with subscribers. This means that somebody has not only taken their time to watch the video but they have gone a step further and checked what you offer and would like to continue seeing your videos. \n\n**Click through rate**: click-through rate shows you what percentage of your impressions on YouTube turned into views. This measures how often viewers watched a video after seeing an impression. Keep in mind, while some of your views come from impressions, some views might come from sources with no thumbnail impression, such as views from links shared outside of YouTube.\n\nAs your videos become more popular, they may get shown to a wider audience, and you may get more impressions. Since this audience may extend beyond your core viewers, your click-through rates may be lower, but don\u2019t worry, you may still see an increase in overall views and watch time.\n\nHigh CTR isn\u2019t always a strong indicator of success. Be sure to look holistically at the content and conditions around that video. Look at Average view duration, Average percentage viewed to get a fuller picture of how well the video appeals to your audience. \n\n**youtube_watch_hours**: We all like to watch youtube, yet what youtube really cares is the amount of hours we watch various videos, so they can pump ads to billions of people. CTDS\n\n**youtube_avg_watch_duration:** As the names suggests, it suggest amount of average time a user spends watching a youtube video.  Average watch duration is a indicator that the content is engaging to the user, and satisfies the purpose of person engaging with the content. A less average watch duration can be a indicator to change the format and style of content.\n\n**youtube_subscribers:** The amount of people who likes the videos you make and tune into watch your episode frequently. They are the core supporters of channel and your intended audience of\nthe content you are making people engage into.\n\n**youtube_comments:** This metric can be used for both quantitative and qualitative purposes. Quantitatively, comments are vitally important to see how people are choosing to comment, like, or embed your video.The high number of comments on your video suggests that the format, topic, or style has worked well and could possibly work well again on your next video. \n\n**youtube_likes:** Likes are like an upvote in Kaggle given as an appreciation for the content you produced. \n\n**youtube_dislikes**: Dislikes are just like downvotes as the content you produced may not appeal to all the users, and may not like certain aspects like video quality, youtuber who makes it etc.","864ba852":"<div class=h3> Which video is being having best like vs dislike ratio<\/div>","2874804e":"<div class=h2> Artificial Intelligence podcast<\/div>\n\nOne of most prominent interview series with people in artifical intelligence is being run by Lex Fridman which titled Artificial Intelligence podcast .
