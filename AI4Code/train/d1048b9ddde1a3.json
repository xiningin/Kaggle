It is a guided project I did for a short course on Dataquest. Data was sourced via wikipedia and scrapped by the instructor. In this project, I will answer a few questions based on the data such as:\n\n1. What is the total combined points?\n2. What are the superbowls with the higest and lowest scores?\n3. Do blowouts result in loss of viewership?\n4. How has viewership, ratings and tv adverts cost changed over time?\n5. Which musician has most halftime show appearances and ,\n6. Who performed most halftime songs?\n\nThis was I think my first every data science project and was posted on my GitHub about 2 years ago. I just wanted to have it here, to remind me of how far I have come.","0c6f4ebe":"## Exploratory Data Analysis","f562c882":"#### Word on Missing Data.\n\nAbove result shows we have some missing data. However, we cannot drop these data due to certain reasons.\nFrom the shape of our data, we can see that the it is small, hence dropping columns will make us lose important data.\nHence, we will proceed with the analsysis and deal with missing data in other ways at appriopriate time.","277a5af1":"### Question 4.
