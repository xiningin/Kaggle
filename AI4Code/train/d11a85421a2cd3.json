We know most of the machine learning models uses assumpton of normality so these variables might need to be scaled, But we may consider the assumption to be true according Central Limit Theorem that if number of observation is large we can consider the distribution to be normal or bell shaped. Removing Outliers may also help us to achieve normal distribution of that variable.\n\nIt looks like Glucose, BP and BMI variables have some outliers.\n\nVariables are not correlated strongly with each other.

It is an expansion of bivariate data analysis, which considers only two variables in its models. As multivariate models consider more variables, they can examine more complex phenomena and find data patterns that more accurately represent the real world.","49d7e4c5":"**Fitting a linea model to this data will not lead to better accuracy because data points are not linearly seperable, May be in higher dimension we can some more details in my 4th Notebook.

It looks like there is no missing value, and boolean, float , integers are different datatypes available. Well descriptive analysis shows that variable Glucose, BoodPressure,SckinThickness, Insulin and BMI have minimum value 0 which does not make any sense, these values are either missing or outliers, But i am not going to alter them so that i can see actual statistics of Data. I can see in Pregnancies column, minimum is 0 (May be this is sign for no pregnancy) which is considerable, But maximum month of pregnancy is 17 which does not make any sense. Variance among different predictor variable is varying at large scale , Scaling data will be helpful for Predective modelling.","04d3592e":"<font color = 'blue'>**Nice, Variables are not much associated linearly.**<\/font>"}}
