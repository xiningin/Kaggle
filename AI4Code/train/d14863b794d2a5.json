Confirmed COVID-19 cases in Southeast Asia's only landlocked country have remained steady at 19 for over a month, and there are zero reported deaths.\n\nAfter a strict nationwide lockdown was partially lifted earlier this month, restaurants, some retail and service businesses like salons and auto shops were allowed to open, but people could not travel outside their provinces. Offices were allowed to reopen if they adopted \"rotating shifts,\" the Nikkei Asian Review reported.\n\nThe country's National Task Force for COVID-19 Prevention and Control announced at a press conference that more offices and businesses will resume normal operations. Some schools will reopen and certain sports activities will be permitted, reports The Laotian Times. \n\nLaos' 7 million citizens will also be allowed to travel domestically, though foreign travelers are still not allowed in.\nOfficials stress that social distancing and other preventive measures are still in effect \u2014 and if more cases appear, strict rules such as shuttering businesses and banning social gatherings will be reimposed.https:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/coronavirus-live-updates\/2020\/05\/17\/856475752\/with-19-confirmed-covid-19-cases-and-no-deaths-laos-to-loosen-lockdown","6fcec6f2":"#UXO, a wartime legacy\n\n![](https:\/\/balladofnature.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/12\/Screen-Shot-2018-12-14-at-1.43.23-AM.png)\n\nUXO, a wartime legacy: 270 million bombs were dropped by the USA on this poor little country during Vietnam War. Even to this day, a few people (mostly children) die or get severely injured every year by some of those unexploded bombs in agricultural fields etc. This organization makes efforts to remove some of those unexploded bombs and prevent some deaths. It was heart breaking to see how some parts of the country was destroyed during Vietnam war.\n\n","0b02bbaf":"#Codes from Dharmendra Sharma https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/dharmendradausa\/knn-classification","5981db59":"The government's lockdown has largely succeeded in containing the coronavirus, \"but it's not good for the business and the economy,\" The restaurant nearly went under after it shifted to takeaway-only service and there were few customers.\n\n\"Many Laos citizens who invest in their own businesses complain a lot and hurt a lot\" from the lockdown, Some are skeptical of the official claim that the country only has 19 COVID-19 cases. Laos shares a border with \u2014 and is heavily dependent on tourism from \u2014 China.\n\"Many people complain and ask the question to each other, but they feel uncomfortable about asking the government.\n\nIn Laos, A Chinese-Funded Railway Sparks Hope For Growth \u2014 And Fears Of Debt\nLaos' first cases were confirmed on March 24. The government says through aggressive testing of migrant workers and travelers entering the country, it has managed to achieve the lowest number of cases in Southeast Asia. \n\nLaos is moving quickly to reopen relative to other countries in the region. Small economies took an immediate, direct hit because of COVID-19, \n\n\"Closing the borders obviously has a direct kind of shock,\" \nWhile Laos' GDP has consistently grown over the last few years, it was only about $18 billion in 2019, according to the International Monetary Fund. The IMF ranked Laos' GDP 35th out of 42 countries in Asia last year.\n\nThe Southeast Asia region will likely see average GDP growth of just 2 per cent to 3 per cent for 2020. That's compared to the 4.9 per cent growth the Asian Development Bank predicted for the region before the start of the year.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/coronavirus-live-updates\/2020\/05\/17\/856475752\/with-19-confirmed-covid-19-cases-and-no-deaths-laos-to-loosen-lockdown","a2fd7602":"Das War's, Kaggle Notebook Runner: Mar\u00edlia Prata @mpwolke"}}
