Heart failure does not mean that the heart stops beating \u2014 that\u2019s a common misperception. Instead, the heart keeps working, but the body\u2019s need for blood and oxygen isn\u2019t being met.<\/p>\n\n<p style=\"color:blue;font-size:21px;\">Your body depends on the heart\u2019s pumping action to deliver oxygen- and nutrient-rich blood to the body\u2019s cells. When the cells are nourished properly, the body can function normally. With heart failure, the weakened heart can\u2019t supply the cells with enough blood. This results in fatigue and shortness of breath and some people have coughing.
