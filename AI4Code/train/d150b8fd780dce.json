You just got some contract work with an Ecommerce company based in New York City that sells clothing online but they also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers come in to the store, have sessions\/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want.\n\nThe company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website. They've hired you on contract to help them figure it out!

It has Customer info, suchas Email, Address, and their color Avatar. Then it also has numerical value columns:\n\n* Avg. Session Length: Average session of in-store style advice sessions.\n* Time on App: Average time spent on App in minutes\n* Time on Website: Average time spent on Website in minutes\n* Length of Membership: How many years the customer has been a member. \n\n** Read in the Ecommerce Customers csv file as a DataFrame called customers.**","ff06ada3":"** How can you interpret these coefficients? **","790c320b":"## Training and Testing Data\n\nNow that we've explored the data a bit, let's go ahead and split the data into training and testing sets.\n** Set a variable X equal to the numerical features of the customers and a variable y equal to the \"Yearly Amount Spent\" column. **"}}
