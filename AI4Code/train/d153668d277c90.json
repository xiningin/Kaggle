COVID-19 rapid guideline on critical care on March 21, which emphasizes all patients be assessed using a recognized frailty score before being directed to intensive care.\n\nThe crisis has meant each hospital in Italy is having to create its own rules for ICU admission, with the selection based on physical status now a commonly employed criterion.\nhttps:\/\/www.medscape.com\/viewarticle\/927432#vp_3","9f736aff":"youtube.com","b68e03be":"#ICU Lessons on COVID-19 From Italian Front Line: Be Flexible\n\nDavide Manca, PhD, professor of process systems engineering at the Polytechnic University of Milan, Italy, predicts that, based on the above numbers and people continuing to respect the quarantine there, it could be that the rate of increase in patients needing ICU beds might start to fall by early April.\n\nUsing official Italian data in his short report, published online March 19 by the European Society of Anaesthesiology, he shows that the average time spent in the ICU in Italy by a patient with COVID-19 is 15 days, with a minimum of 10 days. This is crucial to know for the planning of healthcare services and ICU provision elsewhere.\n\n#Adopt a wartime mentality to face the Pandemic.\n\nAlthough the provision of ICU beds can be quickly ramped up, the quality of newer beds may not be optimal, for example.\n\nThis means that best practices and standard assumptions...must be relaxed, or changed, or wisely adapted. Everything must be done quicker to find solutions.\n\nThis includes use of technologies such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), which can be used to help reduce the number of patients who need ventilation in intensive care. https:\/\/www.medscape.com\/viewarticle\/927432","741a2366":"#Top 10 Must-Dos in ICU in COVID-19 Include Prone Ventilation\n\nTen of the recommendations cover potential pharmacotherapies, most of which have only weak or no evidence of benefit, as discussed in a recent perspective on Medscape.\n\nDealing With Tide of COVID-19 Patients, Protecting Healthcare Workers. COVID-19 cases are rising rapidly worldwide, and so we are increasingly seeing that intensive care units(ICU) have difficulty in dealing with the tide of patients. We need more resource in ICUs, and quickly. This means more ventilators and more trained personnel. In the meantime, this guidance aims to rationalize our approach and to avoid unproven strategies.\n\nAt the same time as caring for patients, we need to make sure that health workers are following procedures which will allow themselves to be protected against infection. We must protect them, they are in the frontline. We cannot allow our healthcare workers to be at risk. On top of that, if they get infected they could also spread the disease further.\nhttps:\/\/www.medscape.com\/viewarticle\/927855#vp_2","6574d05c":"#Number of Patients With COVID-19 in ICU Doubles Every 2 to 3 Days\n\nThis rate slows fractionally every day until, after 3 to 4 weeks, the doubling time is around 4 to 5 days.
