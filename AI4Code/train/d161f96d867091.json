Introduction to Matplotlib\n\n\n**Matplotlib** is the basic plotting library of Python programming language. It is the most prominent tool among Python visualization packages. Matplotlib is highly efficient in performing wide range of tasks. It can produce publication quality figures in a variety of formats.  It can export visualizations to all of the common formats like PDF, SVG, JPG, PNG, BMP and GIF. It can create popular visualization types \u2013 line plot, scatter plot, histogram, bar chart, error charts, pie chart, box plot, and many more types of plot. Matplotlib also supports 3D plotting. Many Python libraries are built on top of Matplotlib. For example, pandas and Seaborn are built on Matplotlib. They allow to access Matplotlib\u2019s methods with less code. \n\n\nThe project **Matplotlib** was started by John Hunter in 2002. Matplotlib was originally started to visualize Electrocorticography (ECoG) data of epilepsy patients during post-doctoral research in Neurobiology. The open-source tool Matplotlib emerged as the most widely used plotting library for the Python programming language. It was used for data visualization during landing of the Phoenix spacecraft in 2008.\n","890d72e1":"### Formatting the style of plot\n\n\nFor every x, y pair of arguments, there is an optional third argument which is the format string that indicates the color and line type of the plot. The letters and symbols of the format string are from MATLAB. We can concatenate a color string with a line style string. The default format string is 'b-', which is a solid blue line. For example, to plot the above line with red circles, we would issue the following command:-","001a147a":"The above code snippet generates a blue dashed line, a green dash-dotted line and a red dotted line.","c99f174b":"## 16.\tScatter Plot\n\nAnother commonly used plot type is the scatter plot. Here the points are represented individually with a dot or a circle.\n\n\n### Scatter Plot with plt.plot()\n\nWe have used plt.plot\/ax.plot to produce line plots. We can use the same functions to produce the scatter plots as follows:-\n\n","85f493ca":"## 6. Matplotlib Object Hierarchy\n\n\nThere is an Object Hierarchy within Matplotlib. In Matplotlib, a plot is a hierarchy of nested Python objects. \nA**hierarch** means that there is a tree-like structure of Matplotlib objects underlying each plot.\n\n\nA **Figure** object is the outermost container for a Matplotlib plot. The **Figure** object contain multiple **Axes** objects. So, the **Figure** is the final graphic that may contain one or more **Axes**. The **Axes** represent an individual plot.\n\n\nSo, we can think of the **Figure** object as a box-like container containing one or more **Axes**. The **Axes** object contain smaller objects such as tick marks, lines, legends, title and text-boxes.\n","6a046193":"## 25. Contour Plot\n\n\n**Contour plots** are useful to display three-dimensional data in two dimensions using contours or color-coded regions.\n**Contour lines** are also known as **level lines** or **isolines**. **Contour lines** for a function of two variables are \ncurves where the function has constant values. They have specific names beginning with iso- according to the nature of the variables being mapped.\n\n\nThere are lot of applications of **Contour lines** in several fields such as meteorology(for temperature, pressure, rain, wind\nspeed), geography, magnetism, engineering, social sciences and so on.\n\n\nThe density of the lines indicates the **slope** of the function. The **gradient** of the function is always perpendicular to the contour lines. When the lines are close together, the length of the gradient is large and the variation is steep.\n\n\nA **Contour plot** can be created with the **plt.contour()** function as follows:-","545f3ffa":"## 24. Area Chart\n\n\nAn **Area Chart** is very similar to a **Line Chart**. The area between the x-axis and the line is filled in with color or shading. It represents the evolution of a numerical variable following another numerical variable.\n\nWe can create an Area Chart as follows:-\n","e0582603":"## 32. Adding a legend\n\n\nLegends are used to describe what each line or curve means in the plot. \n\nLegends for curves in a figure can be added in two ways. One method is to use the **legend** method of the axis object and \npass a list\/tuple of legend texts as follows:-","4ff7f5fe":"A better method is to use the **label** keyword argument when plots are added to the figure. Then we use the **legend** method without arguments to add the legend to the figure. \n\nThe advantage of this method is that if curves are added or removed from the figure, the legend is automatically updated\naccordingly. It can be achieved by executing the code below:-\n","bc38615d":"## 26. Styles with Matplotlib Plots\n\n\nThe Matplotlib version 1.4 which was released in August 2014 added a very convenient `style` module. It includes a number of \nnew default stylesheets, as well as the ability to create and package own styles.\n\nWe can view the list of all available styles by the following command.\n\n\n`print(plt.style.availabe)`\n","33101f22":"## 2. Overview of Python Visualization Tools\n\n\n\nPython is the preferred language of choice for data scientists. Python have multiple options for data visualization. It has several tools which can help us to visualize the data more effectively. These Python data visualization tools are as follows:-\n\n\n\n\u2022\tMatplotlib\n\n\u2022\tSeaborn\n\n\u2022\tpandas\n\n\u2022\tBokeh\n\n\u2022\tPlotly\n\n\u2022\tggplot\n\n\u2022\tpygal\n\n\n\nIn the following sections, I discuss Matplotlib as the data visualization tool. \n","651dd9d5":"## 13.\tParts of a Plot\n\n\nThere are different parts of a plot. These are title, legend, grid, axis and labels etc. These are denoted in the following figure:-\n\n\n![Parts%20of%20a%20plot.png](attachment:Parts%20of%20a%20plot.png)","623d78b7":"## 8. Pyplot API \n\n\n**Matplotlib.pyplot** provides a MATLAB-style, procedural, state-machine interface to the underlying object-oriented library in Matplotlib. **Pyplot** is a collection of command style functions that make Matplotlib work like MATLAB. Each pyplot function makes some change to a figure - e.g., creates a figure, creates a plotting area in a figure etc. \n\n\n**Matplotlib.pyplot** is stateful because the underlying engine keeps track of the current figure and plotting area information and plotting functions change that information. To make it clearer, we did not use any object references during our plotting we just issued a pyplot command, and the changes appeared in the figure.\n\n\nWe can get a reference to the current figure and axes using the following commands-\n\n\n`plt.gcf ( )`   # get current figure\n\n`plt.gca ( )`   # get current axes \n\n \n**Matplotlib.pyplot** is a collection of commands and functions that make Matplotlib behave like MATLAB (for plotting). \nThe MATLAB-style tools are contained in the pyplot (plt) interface. \n\nThis is really helpful for interactive plotting, because we can issue a command and see the result immediately. But, it is not suitable for more complicated cases. For these cases, we have another interface called **Object-Oriented** interface, described later.\n","8929143f":"The following code produces sine and cosine curves using Pyplot API.","bf3663fe":"The above command result in creation of subplots. The diagrammatic representation of subplots are as follows:-\n\n\n![Subplots.png](attachment:Subplots.png)","fa862703":"### Plotting from an IPython shell\n\n\nWe can use Matplotlib interactively within an IPython shell. IPython works well with Matplotlib if we specify Matplotlib mode. To enable this mode, we can use the **%matplotlib** magic command after starting ipython. Any plt plot command will cause a figure window to open and further commands can be run to update the plot.\n\n","d5d3ebd9":"The **boxplot()** function takes a set of values and computes the mean, median and other statistical quantities. The following points describe the preceeding boxplot:\n\n\n\u2022\tThe red bar is the median of the distribution. \n\n\u2022\tThe blue box includes 50 percent of the data from the lower quartile to the upper quartile. Thus, the box is centered on the median of the data. \n\n\u2022\tThe lower whisker extends to the lowest value within 1.5 IQR from the lower quartile. \n\n\u2022\tThe upper whisker extends to the highest value within 1.5 IQR from the upper quartile. \n\n\u2022\tValues further from the whiskers are shown with a cross marker.\n\n","5e378514":"In this project, I discuss Matplotlib (the basic plotting library in Python) and throw some light on various charts and customization techniques associated with it.\n\n\nIn particular, I discuss Matplotlib object hierarchy, Matplotlib architecture, Pyplot and Object-Oriented architecture.

I discuss how to customize the graphics with styles. I discuss how to add a grid and how to handle axes and ticks. I discuss how to add labels, title and legend.

It allows us to exercise more control over the figure. In Pyplot API, we depend on some notion of an \"active\" figure or axes. But, in the **Object-Oriented API** the plotting functions are methods of explicit Figure and Axes objects.\n\n\n**Figure** is the top level container for all the plot elements. We can think of the **Figure** object as a box-like container containing one or more **Axes**. \n\n\nThe **Axes** represent an individual plot.

It merges pyplot (for plotting) and NumPy (for mathematical functions) together in an environment closer to MATLAB. This is considered bad practice nowadays. So, the use of **pylab** is strongly discouraged and hence, I will not discuss it any further.\n","02c6c1c5":"## 33. Control colours\n\n\nWe can draw different lines or curves in a plot with different colours. In the code below, we specify colour as the last argument to draw red, blue and green lines.","c4179ac3":"All the available line styles are available in the following table:\n\n\n**Style abbreviation**  **Style**\n\n-                    solid line\n   \n--                   dashed line\n   \n-.                   dash-dot line\n   \n:                    dotted line\n   \n\n\nNow, we can see the default format string for a single line plot is 'b-'.","7bd00509":"## 27. Adding a grid\n\n\nIn some cases, the background of a plot was completely blank. We can get more information, if there is a reference system in the plot. The reference system would improve the comprehension of the plot. An example of the reference system is adding a **grid**.\nWe can add a grid to the plot by calling the **grid()** function. It takes one parameter, a Boolean value, to enable(if True)\nor disable(if False) the grid.","f3cf40f0":"### Plotting from a Jupyter notebook\n\n\nThe Jupyter Notebook (formerly known as the IPython Notebook) is a data analysis and visualization tool that provides multiple tools under one roof.  It provides code execution, graphical plots, rich text and media display, mathematics formula and much more facilities into a single executable document.\n\n\nInteractive plotting within a Jupyter Notebook can be done with the **%matplotlib** command. There are two possible options to work with graphics in Jupyter Notebook. These are as follows:-\n\n\n\u2022\t**%matplotlib notebook** \u2013 This command will produce interactive plots embedded within the notebook.\n\n\u2022\t**%matplotlib inline** \u2013 It will output static images of the plot embedded in the notebook.\n\n\nAfter this command (it needs to be done only once per kernel per session), any cell within the notebook that creates a plot will embed a PNG image of the graphic.\n","58342fd0":"## 29. Handling X and Y ticks\n\n\nVertical and horizontal ticks are those little segments on the axes, coupled with axes labels, used to give a reference system\non the graph.So, they form the origin and the grid lines.\n\nMatplotlib provides two basic functions to manage them - **xticks()** and **yticks()**.\n\nExecuting with no arguments, the tick function returns the current ticks' locations and the labels corresponding to each of them.\n\nWe can pass arguments(in the form of lists) to the ticks functions. The arguments are:-\n\n1. Locations of the ticks\n\n2. Labels to draw at these locations.\n\nWe can demonstrate the usage of the ticks functions in the code snippet below:-\n\n","2d39c446":"**I hope you find this kernel useful and your <font color=\"red\"><b>UPVOTES<\/b><\/font> would be highly appreciated**","a7c640bb":"### Figure and Axes\n\n\nI start by creating a figure and an axes.

The **axes** (an instance of the class plt.Axes) is a bounding box with \nticks and labels. It will contain the plot elements that make up the visualization.

Boxplot\n\n\nBoxplot allows us to compare distributions of values by showing the median, quartiles, maximum and minimum of a set of values.\n\nWe can plot a boxplot with the **boxplot()** function as follows:-","8ee8e0f0":"## 18.\tBar Chart\n\n\nBar charts display rectangular bars either in vertical or horizontal form. Their length is proportional to the values they represent. They are used to compare two or more values.\n\n\nWe can plot a bar chart using plt.bar() function. We can plot a bar chart as follows:-\n","b09eaf35":"### Working with NumPy arrays\n\n\nGenerally, we have to work with NumPy arrays. All sequences are converted to numpy arrays internally.

We can save them using the **savefig()** command as follows:-\n\n\n`fig.savefig(\u2018fig1.png\u2019)`\n\n\n\nWe can explore the contents of the file using the IPython **Image** object.\n\n\n\n`from IPython.display import Image`\n\n\n`Image(\u2018fig1.png\u2019)`\n\n\nIn **savefig()** command, the file format is inferred from the extension of the given filename. Depending on the backend, \nmany different file formats are available. The list of supported file types can be found by using the get_supported_filetypes() method of the figure canvas object as follows:-\n\n\n`fig.canvas.get_supported_filetypes()` \n","f0769d13":"## 15.\tLine Plot\n\n\nWe can use the following commands to draw the simple sinusoid line plot:-\n\n","27847cf9":"The **axis()** command in the example above takes a list of [xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax] and specifies the viewport of the axes.","e418e2b4":"## 20.\tError Bar Chart\n\n\n\nIn experimental design, the measurements lack perfect precision. So, we have to repeat the measurements. It results in \nobtaining a set of values. The representation of the distribution of data values is done by plotting a single data point \n(known as mean value of dataset) and an error bar to represent the overall distribution of data.\n\n\nWe can use Matplotlib's **errorbar()** function to represent the distribution of data values. It can be done as follows:-","5107b40a":"I have created a basic Area chart. I could also use the stackplot function to create the Area chart as follows:-\n\n`plt.stackplot(x12, y12)`\n\nThe fill_between() function is more convenient for future customization.\n","089b3aa2":"The above plot displays the output of the previous code. The title `First Plot` is displayed on top of the plot.","ff270cd3":"`plt.plot([1, 3, 2, 4], 'b-')`\n\nThis code line is the actual plotting command. Only a list of values has been plotted that represent the vertical coordinates of the points to be plotted. Matplotlib will use an implicit horizontal values list, from 0 (the first value) to N-1 (where N is the number of items in the list).","fc826af2":"### plot() - A versatile command\n\n\n**plot()** is a versatile command. It will take an arbitrary number of arguments. For example, to plot x versus y, \nwe can issue the following command:-","1464d1c7":"The optional **bottom** parameter of the plt.bar() function allows us to specify a starting position for a bar. Instead of running from zero to a value, it will go from the bottom to value. The first call to plt.bar() plots the blue bars. The second call to plt.bar() plots the red bars, with the bottom of the red bars being at the top of the blue bars.","834a2c12":"We can control the limits for each axis separately using the `xlim()` and `ylim()` functions.

The x-axis values ranges from 0-3 and the y-axis from 1-4. If we provide a single list or array to the plot() command, matplotlib assumes it is a sequence of y values, and automatically generates the x values. Since python ranges start with 0, the default x vector has the same length as y but starts with 0. Hence the x data are [0,1,2,3] and y data are [1,2,3,4].","367e41b7":"## 28. Handling axes\n\n\nMatplotlib automatically sets the limits of the plot to precisely contain the plotted datasets. Sometimes, we want to set the\naxes limits ourself. We can set the axes limits with the **axis()** function as follows:-","d2e5f3d7":"## 5. Displaying Plots in Matplotlib\n\n\nViewing the Matplotlib plot is context based. The best usage of Matplotlib differs depending on how we are using it. \nThere are three applicable contexts for viewing the plots. The three applicable contexts are using plotting from a script, plotting from an IPython shell or plotting from a Jupyter notebook.\n","ef183ec0":"## 21. Stacked Bar Chart\n\n\nWe can draw stacked bar chart by using a special parameter called **bottom** from the plt.bar() function. It can be done as follows:- ","31ee884c":"## 22. Pie Chart\n\n\nPie charts are circular representations, divided into sectors. The sectors are also called **wedges**. The arc length of each sector is proportional to the quantity we are describing. It is an effective way to represent information when we are interested mainly in comparing the wedge against the whole pie, instead of wedges against each other.\n\nMatplotlib provides the **pie()** function to plot pie charts from an array X. Wedges are created proportionally, so that each value x of array X generates a wedge proportional to x\/sum(X).","e5c50113":"### State-machine interface\n\nPyplot provides the state-machine interface to the underlying object-oriented plotting library. The state-machine implicitly and automatically creates figures and axes to achieve the desired plot.

Adding labels\n\n\nAnother important piece of information to add to a plot is the axes labels, since they specify the type of data we are plotting.","6a8b9c98":"## 31. Adding a title\n\n\nThe title of a plot describes about the plot. Matplotlib provides a simple function **title()** to add a title to an image.  ","32f0b65b":"## 11. First plot with Matplotlib\n\n\nNow, I will start producing plots. Here is the first example:-","c284d5f7":"### Objects and Reference\n\n\nThe main idea with the **Object Oriented API** is to have objects that one can apply functions and actions on. The real advantage of this approach becomes apparent when more than one figure is created or when a figure contains more than one \nsubplot.\n\n\nWe create a reference to the figure instance in the **fig** variable. Then, we ceate a new axis instance **axes** using the \n**add_axes** method in the Figure class instance fig as follows:-\n\n","9025a2fd":"The above method follows the MATLAB API.

Figure and Subplots\n\n\n\nPlots in Matplotlib reside within a Figure object. As described earlier, we can create a new figure with plt.figure() \nas follows:-\n\n\n`fig = plt.figure()`\n\n\nNow, I create one or more subplots using fig.add_subplot() as follows:-\n\n\n`ax1 = fig.add_subplot(2, 2, 1)`\n\n\nThe above command means that there are four plots in total (2 * 2 = 4). I select the first of four subplots (numbered from 1).\n\n\nI create the next three subplots using the fig.add_subplot() commands as follows:-\n\n\n`ax2 = fig.add_subplot(2, 2, 2)`\n\n`ax3 = fig.add_subplot(2, 2, 3)`\n\n`ax4 = fig.add_subplot(2, 2, 4)`","d2fd7527":"## 19.\tHorizontal Bar Chart\n\n\nWe can produce Horizontal Bar Chart using the plt.barh() function.

We can import Matplotlib as follows:-\n\n`import matplotlib`\n\n\nMost of the time, we have to work with **pyplot** interface of Matplotlib. So, I will import **pyplot** interface of Matplotlib as follows:-\n\n\n`import matplotlib.pyplot`\n\n\nTo make things even simpler, we will use standard shorthand for Matplotlib imports as follows:-\n\n\n`import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`\n\n","0ee6bcb3":"If we execute **axis()** without parameters, it returns the actual axis limits.\n\nWe can set parameters to **axis()** by a list of four values. \n\nThe list of four values are the keyword arguments [xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax] allows the minimum and maximum limits for X and Y \naxis respectively.\n ","a0a8443c":"[Go to Top](#0)","dc2aaedd":"## 1. Introduction\n\n\nWhen we want to convey some information to others, there are several ways to do so. The process of conveying the information with the help of plots and graphics is called **Data Visualization**. The plots and graphics take numerical data as input and display output in the form of charts, figures and tables. It helps to analyze and visualize the data clearly and make concrete decisions. It makes complex data more accessible and understandable. The goal of data visualization is to communicate information in a clear and efficient manner.\n\n\nIn this project, I shed some light on **Matplotlib**, which is the basic data visualization tool of Python programming language. Python has different data visualization tools available which are suitable for different purposes. First of all, I will list these data visualization tools and then I will discuss Matplotlib.\n","778aa364":"### Plotting from a script\n\n\n\nIf we are using Matplotlib from within a script, then the **plt.show()** command is of great use. It starts an event loop, \nlooks for all currently active figure objects, and opens one or more interactive windows that display the figure or figures.\n\n\nThe **plt.show()** command should be used only once per Python session. It should be used only at the end of the script. Multiple **plt.show()** commands can lead to unpredictable results and should mostly be avoided.\n","d358a46a":"## 35.
