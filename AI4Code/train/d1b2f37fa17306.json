that for defect types 1 and 2, the 3500 cutoff is very conservative. If the test predictions had the same distribution as the training data, it would remove over half of all predictions! For defect types 3 & 4, which have larger average pixel counts, it is less likely to remove valid predictions but may be too low to function as an effective threshold.\n\n# Threshold Selection\n---\n\nHow to improve our choice of threshold to optimise our score? This will depend a lot on what type of model you are using, and whether it is implicitly designed to make conservative predictions. You may want to experiment with your own models and see how different thresholds affect your model performance when testing them on the training data. In this example I will use the pixel count's tenth percentile for each defect type. ","13d60a24":"# Evaluation: PyTorch Inference Kernel\n---\nTo see how this affects our submission scores, we can test it on [Rishabh's](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/rishabhiitbhu) excellent kernel on [PyTorch inference](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/rishabhiitbhu\/unet-pytorch-inference-kernel). All credit for the code in the hidden cells below is his, so please go and upvote his work!\n\nIn his initial method, predictions are removed if the number of pixels is lower than 3500. For the sake of this evaluation, I'll be leaving all predictions in place at first. We will then create two submissions: one where the 3500 pixel threshold is used in postprocessing, and another when our defect-specific percentile thresholds are used.\n","6aa4bbfa":"With our optimised thresholds, there are over 100 more positive mask cases in our final submission! Now the two sets of predictions can be submitted and the results compared. This has to be done separately, and the 3500-threshold submission was scored in a previous version.","a0a6dda0":"If you're wondering why there is no graph for defect type 2, it's because this model hasn't made any predictions for it! This defect is so rare that getting your models to be confident in identifying it will be a major challenge in this competition. The red line in these graphs are the initial 3500 threshold, while the green lines are our optimised ones. The red line isn't visible for defect type 4 since we kept that threshold the same. In the case of defect types 1 & 3, the new threshold should lead to fewer predictions being discarded.","c15d138a":"In this function I replace 0 values for pixel count with `np.nan`. This is to simplify visualising the pixel counts per defect type in the next section.\n\n# EDA\n---","22de79cc":"# Pixel Thresholds for Score Optimisation\n---\n\nDue to the way in which this competition is scored, predicting even a single pixel in an image with no defect will result in a disproportionate decrease in your score. For this reason, we will typically use a threshold for the minimum number of pixels that must be predicted before an image is said to contain a defect. For example, if a test image prediction contained 1500 pixels of defect type 2, but our threshold was 2000, we would ignore the prediction and simply say that the image has no defect.\n\nMany popular kernels are using a flat threshold  of 3500 pixels across all classes. This seems to me an arbitrary cutoff, and in this kernel I examine the pixel counts per defect type and estimate the optimum thresholds for each one. This will be condensed into a single function for postprocessing. ","ec78dbbb":"The threshold for defect type 4 is rather high, so let's retain the 3500 limit. This works out quite neatly as the approximate 5th percentile for pixel counts in this category.","5f1099fe":"Excellent! Now let's look at the pixel count distributions per defect type. The red line indicates the popular cutoff of 3500.","d904e01f":"# Results\n---\n* PyTorch Inference kernel with 3500 threshold: 0.88607\n* PyTorch Inference kernel with new thresholds: 0.88817!\n\nOptimising the minimum pixel counts for a positive prediction increased the score by 0.0021! Hopefully this procedure will lead to a quick and easy improvement in your own scores. This can be condensed into a single postprocessing function:"}}
