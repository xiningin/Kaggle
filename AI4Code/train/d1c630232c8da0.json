This suggests that these candidates must be getting better options as Bangalore houses many firms offices.\n\n* Almost all of the candidates were not offered any Joining Bonus.\n\n* Almost 50% of the candidates were offered to extend the Date of Joining While the other half were not offered the same\n\n* Most of the candidates were offered E1 band followed by E2 and E3 and E4. Since, most of them were offered E1, thus most of the candidates who did not join are also from E1. Thus, we can say that most of the candidates are freshers or having low experience level. \n\n* Most of the candidates were offered jobs in the Infrastructure Line of Business and Infra has twice more candidates than BFSI who joined but has almost equal numbers who did not join. This suggests that candidates are more likely to not join a BFSI firm.\n\n* Number of candidates who did not join the company from the Direct channel is almost equal to those from Agency Channel even though candidates onboarded through Agency Channel is less. A reason behind this is, while applying through an agency, one gets multiple options of companies to apply, thus selecting the one that gives the best benefits\n\n* The ones who were required to relocate, all of them joined which suggests they are in need of job and money are ready to work from anywhere\n\n* Most of the candidates were of age 22 years to 35 years. It can be observed that the 60 years old candidate did not join. It seems like an error in input as generally people get retired at the age of 60 \n\n* Most of the candidates were expecting per cent hike in CTC of about 50% while a few candidates were expecting a per cent hike more than 300% but we cannot comment on this, as they might have changed the position or department or had been assigned a managerial post\n\n* Candidates who were expecting got a little less of per cent hike. This makes sense as candidates always aspire more than the calibre. We also see few candidates who were offered a high per cent hike in CTC which can be related to those candidates who were expecting these hikes This strongly suggests that these set of candidates had applied for a managerial level or equivalent positions\n\n* A lot of Percent difference in Percent difference CTC is incorrect, thus we will remove them in Outlier Analysis\n\n* Most of the Candidates were having 0 to 8 years of experience. Experience candidates are more likely to join as experienced people understand the work ethics of the corporate world, they don't want to exploit them\n\n* The ones who did not join were given as high as 200 days to accept the offer which suggests that the candidate must be of greater importance to the company as no company offers a time span of 8 months to accept the offer\n\n* Notice Period of a company varies ranging from 0 days to 120 days. Candidates who did not join were given more options of Notice Period starting from 0 days to about 90 days while mostly who joined were not given 0 days of the notice period (except one outlier). This suggests that candidates who joined are less bothered about the notice period","e7174d44":"### Outlier Analysis","763c74b1":"## 3.
