Lisova Pisnya is poem by Lesya Ukrainka.\n\nMavkas were little children who either died unbaptized, were killed by their mothers, or were children who died during the so called \"Mermaids week\" (the week after Trinity when according to Slavic mythology, mermaids walk the earth). It was believed that after death mermaids took these children.\nhttps:\/\/uamodna.com\/en\/articles\/pro-mavku-promovka\/"}}
