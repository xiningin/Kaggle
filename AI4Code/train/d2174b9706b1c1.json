","48872123":"Lets have a look at the data for this and see if there is any correlation to our target variable \"winPlacePerc\".\n\nA correlation between two random vairables describes a statistical association, which basically means how close these two random variables are to having a linear relation ship.  The correlation can range between -1 and 1:\n* A correlation of 1 means the variables are perfectly correlated.\n* A correlation of 0 means there is no corerlation between teh variables.\n* A corerlation of -1 means the variabels are prefectly negatively corerlated (This means an increase in variable 1 dsecribes a decrease in variable 2).\n\n*However, we do want to be carefull NOT to assume that a correlation between two variables means a causation*","b82d5f91":"Here, we see a distribution of how much damage, players that dont kill anyone, can inflict on there enemies. You can see that most players dont deal out too much, this is most likely all the new players trying to figure out the controls and getting to know the game while they continually get beaten up by the more expereince players.","043ab9eb":"## Missing Values\nLets make sure we dont have any missing values.","dfc2a642":"# The Exploratory Part.\nHere We look at the different features associated will the number of kills by a player.\n\n## 1. Number of enemys  the player killed\nThis is the number of enemy players that were killed by each player.","a6d7c757":"Most games played in this data set are squad games.\n\nLooking at the numbers, its almost like the number of players is related to the amount of data in each match mode, ie twice as many games of duo and approx four times as many games in squad mode than there are in solo.\n\nWe saw that for the full data set, there was a person R correlation of 0.38 between 'KillStreaks' and our target variable, 'winPlacePer'. How does this compare if we break the data up into the four seperate match types identified?","cf17ef04":"## 7. Running\nThis is the distance travelled in metres by foot. This will be the majority of the distance for most players.","35c7903e":"## 3. Number of kills while in a vehicle\nThis is the number of enemy players killed while in a vehicle.","2e5c8148":"It appears that the match duration has no bearing on the winPlacePerc. Apparently you can even win the game in just over 2 min, but more commonly the game is won in approximately 1400 or 1850 seconds.\n\n*The match Duration is not a feature that is likely to be useful in predicting the winPlacePer.*\n\n## 13. What about the number of players in a game","3137a341":"The DBNOs and revives features have an irrrelavant value for solo matches. This is due to the values having no variance in the data, so the standard deviation of these features are zero.\n\n> Pearson's correlation coefficient between two variables is defined as the covariance of the two variables divided by the product of their standard deviations.\n","e88b3c34":"There is a reasonable correlation here with the damadge you deal out to enemey players and the winPlacePerc.","dc705310":"There is a higher correlation with boosts with the winPlacePerc than there is with the heals, but both features look like they could be usefull.\n\n# Game features\nThis will include the features specific to the game, such as teh game duration, the humber of teams\/players in a game.\n\n## 12. Does the match duration impact the winning percentage?\nThe match duration is simply, the time in seconds a game takes to copmplete.\n\nYou would think that the match duration has reaosnable predictive power on determining the winner, since the winner has to stay alive for the longest.","6da5b4c9":"## 2. Maximum number of enemy players killed in a short time.\nThis is the number of enemy players killed in a short time by each player (It is not clear on how long a \"short time\" is).","a6f1f100":"Here we can see how the heal items and boost items ae used compared to each other. \n\nThis seems to indicate that using a few healing items increases your chance of winning, but you need to use more boosts to actaully achieve a change of winning.","83e457df":"## Reading the data in.\nWe read the data into the environement, to investigate any relationships with the different features. \n\nHere the data is seperated into training and testing set. The training data is what we will be looking at extensively in this post. The Testing data doesn't contain the target variable, but will be used when developing the model to validate our assumptions on what features we use. \n\nWe will use the fact that the Training data has our target variable to assist in developing some insight on what features are imoprtant.","767f5ec9":"We can see there is very little correlation with making kills from a vehicle and predicting the winPlacePerc.","269bc7f0":"Looking at the correlation with killStreaks for just the solo games, there is a reasonable correlation with the winPlacePer, but not too strong.","b2abda9c":"We see that at least 75% of people dont even go in the water, this is likely related to the specific map the game is played on. Looking at the [maps] indicates that there is very little water to swim through, som e maps have less water than others.\n\nPerhaps it is not a surprise then, that the correlation between swimming distance and winPlacePerc is low.\n\n[maps]: https:\/\/pubg.gamepedia.com\/Maps\n\n## 10. Total distance travelled\nThis is not an existing feature in the data, but we can combine the distance features to forma a total distance measure, so see if this has any predictive power of our target variable.","27433409":"Lets see this in a different way. Here is a plot of the number of players that make 1, 2, 3, ... 8+ kills in a game","229c19f7":"Looking at the correlation with killStreaks for just the duo games, there is a reasonable correlation with the winPlacePer, but not too strong.","a0d00611":"Thats a relief, there is virtually no correlation with the number of team mates you kill and the winPlacePerc. If there was, you would need to keep a close eye on your team mates in a squade game.\n\n## 5. What about the head shot kills?\nThis is the number of enemies that have been killed with a head shot.  \n\nIn order to make a head shot, you either have to be pretty closer or a pretty good shot.","d44cdfe6":"Looking at the correlation with killStreaks for just the custom game modes, there is a small correlation with the winPlacePer.\n\n## 15. Correlation of each Feature for each game mode.\nWe'll have a look at each game mode individually and calculate the correlation of each feature with our target variable, the \"winPlacePerc\".","91fcd991":"Lets create a function to standardises the matchType feature in our data.","27fb0dc1":"There is some correlation with driving distance, but not as strong as walking. This is likely due to the fact that not many people actualy get a licence and drive a vehicle.\n","9b1e081f":"# How does distance travelled fare\nHere we will look at the differnt forms of distance travelled and see if this has any predictive power for our tarrget variable.\n\nWe might assume that the further a player has travelled, the more likely they are to at least reach the final 10-15 players and have a higher \"winPlacePerc\"\n","6e342426":"## 9. Swimming\nThis is the distance in metres travelled through water."}}
