Turing award winner Jim Gray imagined data science as a \"fourth paradigm\" of science (empirical, theoretical, computational and now data-driven) and asserted that \"everything about science is changing because of the impact of information technology\" and the data deluge.'''\ntext","a5bf8cb4":"print(word_tokenize(text))","41982d99":"print(sent_tokenize(text))","cced6ef2":"wrdtok=word_tokenize(text)\nprint(nltk.pos_tag(wrdtok))","7fbc8ffb":"from nltk.corpus import stopwords\nprint(stopwords.words('english'))","902257a1":"stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))\nfiltered_sentence = []  \nfor w in wrdtok: \n    if w not in stop_words:  \n        filtered_sentence.append(w)  \nprint(\"********** Without Stopwords*********** \\n\",wrdtok,\"\\n \\n \")  \nprint(\"***********With Stopwords*************** \\n\",filtered_sentence) ","55d067fb":"from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer \nps = PorterStemmer() \nps_stem_lst=[]\nfor i in wrdtok:\n    strr =ps.stem(i)\n    ps_stem_lst.append(strr)\nprint(ps_stem_lst)    ","af3b4b34":"from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer\nlemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()\nlem_wrd_lst=[]\nfor i in wrdtok:\n    strr =lemmatizer.lemmatize(i)\n    lem_wrd_lst.append(strr)\nprint(lem_wrd_lst)","cca7b087":"Terminology: \n\nCorpus--Body of text, singular.
