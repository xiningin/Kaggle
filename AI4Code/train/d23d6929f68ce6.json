The broad use of the BCG vaccine across a population could reduce the number of carriers, and combined with other measures could act to slow down or stop the spread of COVID-19.\n\nHowever, an alternative explanation would be that COVID-19 in a person with BCG vaccination would have a milder presentation, reducing the possibility that such a case would be even detected in the first place. \nhttps:\/\/www.medrxiv.org\/content\/10.1101\/2020.03.24.20042937v2.full.pdf","20b1ef07":"#BCG Vaccination Protects against Experimental Viral Infection in Humans through the Induction of Cytokines Associated with Trained #Immunity\n\n\nAuthors: Rob J.W.Arts, Simone J.C.F.M.Moorlag, BorisNovakovic, YangLi Shuang-YinWang, MarijeOosting, VinodKumar, Ramnik J.Xavier, CiscaWijmenga, Leo A.B.Joosten1Chantal B.E.M.Reusken, Christine S.Benn, PeterAaby, Marion P.Koopmans, Hendrik G.Stunnenberg, Reinoutvan Crevel, Mihai G.Netea. https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.chom.2017.12.010\n\n\n\nBCG vaccination of humans induces genome-wide epigenetic reprogramming in monocytes.\n\n\nBCG-induced changes correlate with protection against experimental virus infection.\n\n\nViremia reduction correlates with IL-1\u03b2 upregulation, indicative of trained immunity.\n\n\nSNPs in IL1B affect the induction of trained immunity by BCG.\n\n![](https:\/\/ars.els-cdn.com\/content\/image\/1-s2.0-S1931312817305462-fx1.jpg)https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1931312817305462","b4d5b49a":"#Codes by \u00dcnal K\u00f6roglu  https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/nalkrolu\/optimization-of-r-sugar-with-genetic-algorithm\/notebook","9c9559d5":"#No Genetical Algorithm for now.","00c47d23":"Although COVID-19 deaths are concentrated in the elderly population,recent  BCG vaccination in children might play a role in reducing mortality by decreasing the transmission of the disease to the vulnerable population. Asymptomatic children in Germany,\nwhere BCG is not applied to children since 1998, had viral loads that were as high as adults, which suggests that unvaccinated children may be as infectious as adults. A reduction of the viral load in children might act as a plausible mechanism by which BCG vaccination in children could reduce infections and mortality in a country.\n\nA recent study determined that BCG vaccination in childhood did not reduce COVID-19 infection in young adults, a population with reduced mortality due to COVID-19. Patients with bladder cancer that have been treated with multiple doses of BCG constitute a population that is worth studying for possible protective effects against COVID-19.\n\nIf BCG were protective for COVID-19, why did COVID-19 spread in China despite having an universal BCG policy since the 1950s?\n\nThere is still not proof that BCG inoculation at old age would boost defenses in elderly humans against COVID-19, but it seems to do so in Guinea pigs against M. tuberculosis.\nhttps:\/\/www.medrxiv.org\/content\/10.1101\/2020.03.24.20042937v2.full.pdf","8a8a0ee9":"#Optimization of Residual Sugarwith Genetic Algorithm (Attempt since I wasn't able to make LR (due to Nan).","b3e870d6":"#Other columns are plotted (01 week ago) in https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/mpwolke\/azerbaijan-bcg-strain-1nov2020","3f006cb1":"#lr  Logistic Regression is not defined.

They compared BCG vaccination policies with the morbidity and mortality for COVID-19 for middle-high and high-income countries. They found that countries without universal policies of BCG vaccination (Italy, the Netherlands, USA) have been more severely affected compared to countries with universal and long-standing BCG policies.\n\nThe difference cannot be accounted for by differences in disease onset, adoption of early social distancing policies, state of health services, nor income level.
