Understanding the Data Set\n\nThe California Housing data set appeared in a 1997 paper titled *Sparse Spatial Autoregressions*, written by Pace, R. Kelley and Ronald Barry and published in the Statistics and Probability Letters journal. The researchers built this data set by using the 1990 California census data.\n\nThe data contains one row per census block group. A block group is the smallest geographical unit for which the U.S. Census Bureau publishes sample data (a block group typically has a population of 600 to 3,000 people). In this sample a block group on average includes 1425.5 individuals living in a geographically compact area.\n\nThese spatial data contain 20,640 observations on housing prices with 9 economic variables:\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><\/p>\n<pre><strong>Longitude:<\/strong>refers to the angular distance of a geographic place north or south of the earth\u2019s equator for each block group\n<strong>Latitude :<\/strong>refers to the angular distance of a geographic place east or west of the earth\u2019s equator for each block group\n<strong>Housing Median Age:<\/strong>is the median age of the people that belong to a block group. Note that the median is the value that lies at the midpoint of a frequency distribution of observed values\n<strong>Total Rooms:<\/strong>is the total number of rooms in the houses per block group\n<strong>Total Bedrooms:<\/strong>is the total number of bedrooms in the houses per block group\n<strong>Population:<\/strong>is the number of inhabitants of a block group\n<strong>Households:<\/strong>refers to units of houses and their occupants per block group\n<strong>Median Income:<\/strong>is used to register the median income of people that belong to a block group\n<strong>Median House Value:<\/strong>is the dependent variable and refers to the median house value per block group\n<\/pre>\n\nWhat's more, we also learn that all the block groups have zero entries for the independent and dependent variables have been excluded from the data.\n\nThe Median house value is the dependent variable and will be assigned the role of the target variable in our ML model.\n","4a7e4b87":"## 6. Feature Engineering\nNow that we have adjusted the values in medianHouseValue, we will now add the following columns to the data set:\n\n+ Rooms per household which refers to the number of rooms in households per block group;\n+ Population per household, which basically gives us an indication of how many people live in households per block group; And\n+ Bedrooms per room which will give us an idea about how many rooms are bedrooms per block group;\n\nAs we're working with DataFrames, we can best use the `select()` method to select the columns that we're going to be working with, namely `totalRooms`, `households`, and `population`. Additionally, we have to indicate that we're working with columns by adding the `col()` function to our code. Otherwise, we won't be able to do element-wise operations like the division that we have in mind for these three variables:","7d1b3e94":"### 7. Building A Machine Learning Model With Spark ML\n\nWith all the preprocessing done, it's finally time to start building our Linear Regression model!

This combination allows for learning a sparse model where few of the weights are non-zero like Lasso, while still maintaining the regularization properties of Ridge. We control the convex combination of L1 and L2 using the l1_ratio parameter.\n\nElastic-net is useful when there are multiple features which are correlated with one another. Lasso is likely to pick one of these at random, while elastic-net is likely to pick both.\n\nA practical advantage of trading-off between Lasso and Ridge is it allows Elastic-Net to inherit some of Ridge\u2019s stability under rotation.\n\nThe objective function to minimize is in this case:\n\\begin{align}\nmin_w\\frac{1}{2n_{samples}}{\\parallel{X_w - y}\\parallel}^2_2 + \\alpha\\lambda{\\parallel{X_w - y}\\parallel}_1 + \\frac{\\alpha(1-\\lambda)}{2}{\\parallel{w}\\parallel}^2_2\n\\end{align}\n\nhttp:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/linear_model.html#elastic-net","385f40ec":"If you like it, please vote :)","429e0b99":"+ The RMSE measures how much error there is between two datasets comparing a predicted value and an observed or known value.
