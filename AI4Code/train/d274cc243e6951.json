However, in practice you will finally use all combined one and won't have to go through the building blocks process.\n\nWe definitely don't need to put too much weight on the insights that can be gained from an EDA like this. At most we get 2-dimensional relationships, which can be misleading. We will rather focus more on Machine Learning driven EDA.\n\nBut the quest is not over yet! \n\nOn the basis of the feedbacks\/suggestions that I recieve for the kernel, I would add them and convert into a different Kernel so that we can see the progression for our learnings.","16ad03d4":"<a id = \"2.6\">\n### 2.6 Putting it all together\n<\/a>\n\n[Look at this kernel](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/nextbigwhat\/eda-for-categorical-variables-part-2) for clean and concise way of how one simple function will do all this for you","60e3f31f":"<a id = \"1.3\">\n#### 1.3 Count of distinct categories in our variable but this time we don't want to count any nan values","aad2449d":"A better way to analyze will be to look at countplot and boxplot together othwerwise we will have to keep shuffling between two plots. \n\nHere's how we are going to put them together - on the top we have countplot and bottow we will have box plot (or violinplot). <br>\nOr, in the language of seaborn we can say that we have created 2 rows where in the 1st row we have countplot and in the 2nd rwo we have violinplot. How we do that in python is we use subplot functionality in seaborn","23dbfd50":"<a id = \"s3\"> <\/a>\n**Read Below for a quick learning note on how to combine multiple charts in Python using Seaborn**\n\nThere are 2 key elements to really understand seaborn's graphic capability :\n - Figure\n - Graphs\n \nFirst, we\u2019ll start with figure, it\u2019s your entire graphic. Your actual graph is not your figure(Weird!). The figure is the part around your graph. Your chart (or charts) sits  on top of the figure. Usually it's defined by *fig* <br>\n>fig = plt.figure() # Actual python code that we will use eventually \n\nAxesSubplot (or in short ax) is your actual graph. so we call <br>\n>ax = fig.add_subplot(2,1) # Second line of python code that we will use\n\nHere we are saying to python that \"you have created a figure and now add a subplot on that figure. Add the subplot in such a way that you create a 2X1 grid because I intend to use 2 graphs in one figure\"<br>\nA better way to write would be to define ax1 & ax2 in this way - \n\n>ax1 = fig.add_subplot(2,1,1) <br>\n>ax2 = fig.add_subplot(2,1,2)\n\nBenefit of doing it this way is that whenever you use ax1 (or ax2) in any of our plots, Python interpretor will know where to put it this graph.<br>\nNormally you don\u2019t see a lot of people using add_subplot. Why? I don\u2019t know, people like sleek codes. They like to do it all at once. That\u2019s why plt.subplots() exists\n\nYou can refer to this article [here](http:\/\/jonathansoma.com\/lede\/algorithms-2017\/classes\/fuzziness-matplotlib\/how-pandas-uses-matplotlib-plus-figures-axes-and-subplots\/) for an even detailed explanation.
