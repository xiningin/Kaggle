Prepare Data","0a94da03":"# 2. Data understanding","3e0d373e":"The attributes that correlate the most with stress are daily shouting and lost vacation. Daily shouting to others is more a consequence of stress but less time to recharge and disconnect (lost vacation) is a factor that contributes to increasing this stress. Many factors, like sufficient income and sleeping enough improve the well being and reduce this stress. However, what stand out the most is the daily meditation and  time for passion. The exact question asked for daily meditation is:\n\"In a typical week, how many times do you have the opportunity to think  about yourself? Include meditation, praying and relaxation activities such as fitness, walking in a park or lunch breaks\" . \nThis makes it clear that people that block time for themselves to disconnect during the week are the less stressed . We live in a super-connected word and if you add to it family and its responsabilities, finding time to ourselves becomes more challenging. It is however crucial for our well being no matter how busy we can be.\n \nSo the main conclusion is that the time we dedicate to our well being is a crucial parameter in improving our work life balance. This means vacation, time with ourselves to focus only on what we need, and time to do what make us happy\n","fbdddcc9":"## Who's more stressed?","af816d07":"It is  interesting to see that among the highest correlation there is :  \n*     Time for passion- Flow \n*     Time for passion - Achievement\n \n'time for passion' is the time we dedicate to what we enjoy doing. It can be  work, hobbies or volunteering. It is important to have time for passion in our busy lives because it is highly correlated with the 'flow' which is ,as described in the survey: \"*Flow is defined as the mental state, in which you are fully immersed in performing an activity. You then experience a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of this activity*.\" Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi decribed it as \" *the secret to happiness*\"\n \nAccording to the correlation maps people doing what they are passionate about are more successful.\n  \n    ","73f4ef7b":"## How does the attributes correlate with daily stress?","1d1ec910":"## How does the  23 attributes correlate?","10106d15":"## When are we the most stressed?","00c3d9e3":"30 % of the respondents qualify themselves as highly stressed with 4 (18.2%) to 5 hours (12.9%) of daily stress","e57b3a95":"####  In a study about daily habits, the Work-Life Balance survey evaluates how we thrive in both professional and personal lives: it was mainly about 5 aspects of our lives:\n 1. Healthy body, reflecting your fitness and healthy habits;\n 2. Healthy mind, indicating how well you embrace positive emotions;\n 3. Expertise, measuring the ability to grow your expertise and achieve something unique;\n 4. Connection, assessing the strength of your social network and your inclination to discover the world;\n 5. Meaning, evaluating your compassion, generosity and how much 'you are living the life of your dream'.\n \n#### This survey triggered many questions in my mind, most importantly :\n- When are the most stressed? \n- Who is more stressed?\n- What is the correlation between the studied parameters and how do they correlate with the daily stress?\n\nFor some of the questions I used seaborn and matplotlib to generate plots, for the others I relied more on visualizing the correlation between the attributes of interest. For instance a correlation map was more appropriate to understand the correlation between all the attributes,whereas a Pearson correlation method was more helpfull to generate a plot representing clearly the correlation between the atributes and the daily stress ","943a3a0d":"The comparison of the 5 level of stress for the 4 age ranges, shows that people between 36 and 50 years old have the highest percentage of highly stressed people with 33.5% of them having 4 to 5 hours of daily stress.They are closely followed by the 21 to 35 years old ones that 31% of them have more than 4 hours of daily stress.\n\n-> 21 to 50 years old is then the most stressful 30 years.\n\n","f535645d":"The result of the survey was compiled in a kaggle  dataset  by Yvon Dalat.
