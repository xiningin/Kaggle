All the teams have a better chasing record than batting first record (chasing team wins 55.7% matches).This difference is most prominent in Kolkata Knight Riders who have a win percent of 61% chasing but only 41% batting first.\n\nb) About 24% of the games that were won by the batting first team, the winning margin was less than 10 runs. However, 38% of the games won by the winning team were won in the 20th over, showing how close the matches have been.\n\n**Batsman Statistics** <br>\na) Virat Kohli and Suresh Raina are among the highest run scorers in IPL with each scoring more than 5400 runs. However, Chris Gayle also has one of the highest number of runs scored in boundaries with a whooping 76% runs being scored in 4s and 6s. \n\nb) Suresh Raina, Rohit Sharma and David Warner have scored the most number of runs in winning causes. In fact, whenever Raina scored more than 50 runs, 66% of the times his team ended up winning the match (it is 81% for Shane Watson and 74% for MS Dhoni).\n\nc) J. Bairstow is the most consistent batsman who has scored atleast 25 runs in 70% of the matches he played. However, David Warner's record looks very impressive having scored more than 50 runs in 38% of the matches (and 25+ runs in 56% matches) and having played more than 120 matches.\n\n**Bowler Statistics** <br>\na) Lasith Malinga  and Amit Mishra are one of the highest wicket takers in IPL. 43% of the wickets taken by Malinga have been either bowled or LBW. Bhuvaneshwar Kumar has one of the highest dot ball percents (41%) among the leading wicket takers.\n\nb) Among major bowlers (who bowled more than 20 overs), Sohail Tanvir and A Chandillan are one of the most economical bowlers with an economy of around 6.22 and 6.28. However, Anil Kumble has one of the best economies in the death overs of 6.64. \n\n**Stadium Statistics** <br>\na) The team batting first has a winning chance of 44.3%.

However, across the stadiums in Chennai the team batting first wins whooping 61% of the games while this number is very low in Jaipur (32%).
