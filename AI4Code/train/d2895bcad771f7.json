","4781ac28":"Takeaway:\n* Segment type indicates the medium of usage, and Tinder has a mobile-based, web-based app as well as a separate feature called 'Tinder U,' geared towards connecting students to students.

Because there are <500 rows in this small dataset, it would not be feasible to conduct robust analysis on individual university samples.\n* Answer column indicates whether the respondent is using Tinder as of now.

It is serivced in almost 200 countries with more than 6 million paying subscribers.\n\nTinder is know for gamifiying social interactions associated with dating. It lets users anonymously swipe 'left' or 'right' on other user profiles (which includes short bio and photos) to indicate interest, where left swipe mean dislike and right swipe mean like.
