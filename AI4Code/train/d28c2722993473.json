There is no problem finding test kits in South Korea. Four companies were licensed to manufacture these kits. Thus, the capacity to conduct 140 thousand tests per week was created.\n4. For example, while Italy tested 206 thousand, Russia 143 thousand and USA 104 thousand, South Korea applied 316 thousand people the Coronavirus test.
