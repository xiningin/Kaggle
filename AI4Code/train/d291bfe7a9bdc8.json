The classification algorithms that we usally use need some sort of numerical feature vector in order to perform the classification task. There are actually many methods to convert a corpus to a vector format. The simplest is the bag-of-words approach, where each unique word in a text will be represented by one number.\n\nIn this section we'll convert the raw messages (sequence of characters) into vectors (sequences of numbers).\n\nAs a first step, let's write a function that will split a message into its individual words and return a list. We'll also remove very common words, ('the', 'a', etc..). To do this we will take advantage of the NLTK library. It's pretty much the standard library in Python for processing text and has a lot of useful features. We'll only use some of the basic ones here.\n\nLet's create a function that will process the string in the message column, then we can just use apply() in pandas do process all the text in the DataFrame.\n\nFirst removing punctuation. We can just take advantage of Python's built-in string library to get a quick list of all the possible punctuation:","ada7da1d":"*    max_df: float in range [0.0, 1.0] or int, default=1.0\n*        When building the vocabulary, ignore terms that have a document frequency strictly higher than the given threshold (corpus-specific stop words).\n*        If float, the parameter represents a proportion of documents.\n*        If integer, the parameter represents an absolute count.","36a4981c":"# Vectorization\n\nCurrently, we have the messages as lists of tokens (also known as lemmas) and now we need to convert each of those messages into a vector the SciKit Learn's algorithm models can work with.\n\nNow we'll convert each message, represented as a list of tokens (lemmas) above, into a vector that machine learning models can understand.\n\nWe'll do that in three steps using the bag-of-words model:\n\n*    Count how many times does a word occur in each message (Known as term frequency)\n*    Weigh the counts, so that frequent tokens get lower weight (inverse document frequency)\n*    Normalize the vectors to unit length, to abstract from the original text length (L2 norm)\n\nLet's begin the first step:\n\nEach vector will have as many dimensions as there are unique words in the SMS corpus. We will first use SciKit Learn's CountVectorizer. This model will convert a collection of text documents to a matrix of token counts.\n\nWe can imagine this as a 2-Dimensional matrix.

In this model, the probabilities describing the possible outcomes of a single trial are modeled using a logistic function.\n"}}
