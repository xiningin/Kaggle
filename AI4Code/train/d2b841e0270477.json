As it was expected the test data contained half class 1 and the other half class 0.\nAlthough the KNN divided the test data into two classes with almost the same numbers, the results were not promising (52%).\nI thought to share this Kernel with the fellow here at Kaggle (Kaggeleres). \nAny feedback is appreciated.","72a1e341":"See the submit data","09cb3c86":"# Parse data and drop columns","010b9fad":"# Save submit data","585b6432":"# Functions","0e1550a5":"# Read data","e2ed1325":"# Fit KNN clustering model"}}
