Proteins are polymers \u2013 specifically polypeptides \u2013 formed from sequences of amino acids, the monomers of the polymer. A single amino acid monomer may also be called a residue indicating a repeating unit of a polymer [Reference](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Protein_structure)\n\n![](http:\/\/paulbrinson.weebly.com\/uploads\/5\/9\/8\/1\/59812627\/1628628_orig.gif)","5c5de8d8":"### Company Information \n\n#### Human Protein Atlas\n\n![](https:\/\/www.ebi.ac.uk\/gxa\/resources\/images\/experiment-list-latest\/human_protein_atlas.png)\n\nThe Human Protein Atlas (HPA) is a Swedish-based program started in 2003 with the aim to map of all the human proteins in cells, tissues and organs using integration of various omics technologies, including antibody-based imaging, mass spectrometry-based proteomics, transcriptomics and systems biology.

Due to their central role in biological function, protein interactions also control the mechanisms leading to healthy and diseased states in organisms. Diseases are often caused by mutations affecting the binding interface or leading to biochemically dysfunctional allosteric changes in proteins. Therefore, protein interaction networks can elucidate the molecular basis of disease, which in turn can inform methods for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. In this chapter, we will describe the computational approaches to predict and map networks of protein interactions and briefly review the experimental methods to detect protein interactions. We will describe the application of protein interaction networks as a translational approach to the study of human disease and evaluate the challenges faced by these approaches.
