Although this Trend is keep on decreasing and currently, Only Poondi Reservoir has some water left. All other three reservoirs are running empty.\nOn 2014 December approx, there's a sudden growth in water level that is very unnatural. Maybe supplied from some other region. Downfall in water level is significant in 2019 Feb-July. Evidence of water shortage can be noticed in all four reservoir between a period of 2017-2018 year transition.\nAlso the dry period generally ends at the starting of December just after the dry period which generally occurs in october.****","e219db3c":"**Seasonality in graphs can be explained using this evidence.
