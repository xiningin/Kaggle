(We\u2019ll see examples in both one and two dimensions in this chapter, though a cellular automaton can exist in any finite number of dimensions.)\n2. ### Each cell has a state. The number of state possibilities is typically finite. The simplest example has the two possibilities of 1 and 0 (otherwise referred to as \u201con\u201d and \u201coff\u201d or \u201calive\u201d and \u201cdead\u201d).\n3. ### Each cell has a neighborhood. This can be defined in any number of ways, but it is typically a list of adjacent cells."}}
