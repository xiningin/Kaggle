A score of 95 or higher counts as 3 stars, a score of at least 85 but less than 95 is 2 stars. Any other score is 1 star.\n\nAlso, the Canadian Vintners Association bought a lot of ads on the site, so any wines from Canada should automatically get 3 stars, regardless of points.\n\nCreate a series `star_ratings` with the number of stars corresponding to each review in the dataset.","c712b3f3":"## 1.\n\nWhat is the median of the `points` column in the `reviews` DataFrame?"}}
