It will also coincide as Recommendation Systems.\n\nThese applications may have come up in the following ways, such as \"bought this product that bought that product\" or \"those who viewed that ad also looked at these ads\" or \"we created a playlist for you\" or \"recommended video for the next video\".\n\nThese scenarios are the most frequently encountered scenarios within the scope of e-commerce data science data mining studies.\n\nIn Turkey and the world's largest e-commerce companies spotify, amazon, it uses many platforms like netflix recommendation systems can know a little more closely.\n\n### So what does this association analysis summarize?\n\n#### Apriori Algorithm\n\nIt is the most used method in this field.\n\nAssociation rule analysis is carried out by examining some metrics:\n\n* Support\n    Support(X, Y) = Freq(X,Y)\/N\n        X: Product\n        Y: Product\n        N: Total Shopping\n\n* Confidence\n\n        Confidence (X, Y) = Freq (X, Y) \/ Freq (X)\n\n* Lift (The purchase of one product increases the level of purchase of the other.)\n\n        Lift = Support (X, Y) \/ (Support (X) * Support (Y))\n","b5ebb5c3":"Thus, support values are calculated.
