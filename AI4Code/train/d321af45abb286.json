NaN\nWhen we don't want a NumPy array to contain a value at a particular index, we can use np.nan to act as a placeholder. A common usage for np.nan is as a filler value for incomplete data.\n\nThe code below shows an example usage of np.nan. Note that np.nan cannot take on an integer type.","55a7dee2":"# E. Infinity\nTo represent infinity in NumPy, we use the np.inf special value. We can also represent negative infinity with -np.inf.\n\nThe code below shows an example usage of np.inf.

Casting\nWe cast NumPy arrays through their inherent astype function. The function's required argument is the new type for the array. It returns the array cast to the new type.\n\nThe code below shows an example of casting using the astype function. The dtype property returns the type of an array.","9f7ac25d":"# B. Copying\nSimilar to Python lists, when we make a reference to a NumPy array it doesn't create a different array. Therefore, if we change a value using the reference variable, it changes the original array as well. We get around this by using an array's inherent copy function. The function has no required arguments, and it returns the copied array.\n\nIn the code example below, c is a reference to a while d is a copy. Therefore, changing c leads to the same change in a, while changing d does not change the value of b.","5dea9b65":"# A. Arrays\nNumPy arrays are basically just Python lists with added features. In fact, you can easily convert a Python list to a Numpy array using the np.array function, which takes in a Python list as its required argument. The function also has quite a few keyword arguments, but the main one to know is dtype. The dtype keyword argument takes in a NumPy type and manually casts the array to the specified type.\n\nThe code below is an example usage of np.array to create a 2-D matrix. Note that the array is manually cast to np.float32."}}
