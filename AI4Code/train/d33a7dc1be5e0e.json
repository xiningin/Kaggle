Yet, available occupant field data are insufficient to explore the mechanisms that drive this interaction.\"\n\n\"That paper introduces data from a one year study of 24 U.S. office occupants that recorded a comprehensive set of possible exogenous and endogenous drivers of personal comfort and behavior over time. The longitudinal data collection protocol merges individual thermal comfort, preference, and behavior information from online daily surveys with datalogger readings of occupants\u2019 local thermal environments and control states, yielding 2503 survey responses alongside tens of thousands of concurrent behavior and environment measurements.\"\n\n\"These data have been used to uncover links between the built environment, personal variables, and adaptive actions, and the data contribute to international research collaborations focused on understanding the human-building interaction.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41597-019-0273-5","97c4457d":"#What a difference makes when we include Header =11!

Additionally, illuminance and CO2 concentration were logged for certain occupants across floors using the HOBO U12-012 sensor (accuracy dependent on wavelength31) and the TelAir 7001 CO2 sensor (accuracy: greater of +\/\u221250 ppm or 5% of reading), respectively. Sensor calibration was not performed after initial deployment. Further information on the location of each sensor including floor number, perimeter vs. core position within each floor, and office type are provided in the data record.\"\n\n\"Datalogger measurements of occupant behavior recorded window adjustments and the use of personal fans and heaters. For windows, HOBO UX-90 state loggers were attached to 10 different windows that occupants in the sample reported using in the background survey. The UX-90 loggers record the time stamp of any state change during the measurement period. For fans and heaters, WattsUp? Pro power meters logged wattage at occupant-designated fan\/heater outlets at 15\u2009minute intervals. The WattsUp? meters were installed at the desks of all 9 occupants who reported using a heater or fan at some point throughout the year on the background survey.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41597-019-0273-5","4b9bd512":"**<span style=\"color:#DC143C;\">Rethinking indoor thermal comfort in the era of rebound and pre\u2010bound effect for the developing world: A systematic review<\/span>**\n\nAuthors: Jeetika Malik,  Ronita Bardhan , Pradipta Banerji\nFirst published: 09 March 2020 https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1111\/ina.12664\nhttps:\/\/publons.com\/publon\/10.1111\/ina.12664\n\n![](https:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/cms\/asset\/d7c28953-2a30-4630-a165-e5e9a81c3438\/ina12664-fig-0005-m.jpg)onlinelibrary.wiley.com\nhttps:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/ina.12664","69779497":"Citation: Langevin, J.

Increasing probabilities of high clothing insulation, fans turned on, and open windows are observed with increasing operative temperature, while increasing probabilities of heavier clothing and heaters turned on are observed with decreasing operative temperature.\"\n\n\"Occupants with warmer acceptability ranges are significantly less likely to engage in behaviors that address warm discomfort, while occupants with cooler acceptability ranges are significantly less likely to engage in behaviors that address cool discomfort.
