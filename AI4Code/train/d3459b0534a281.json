Breast cancer can occur in both men and women, but it's far more common in women.\n\nSubstantial support for breast cancer awareness and research funding has helped created advances in the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. Breast cancer survival rates have increased, and the number of deaths associated with this disease is steadily declining, largely due to factors such as earlier detection, a new personalized approach to treatment and a better understanding of the disease.[1]\n\n[[1 Source]](https:\/\/www.mayoclinic.org\/diseases-conditions\/breast-cancer\/symptoms-causes\/syc-20352470\/) \n\n## Attribute Information:\n\n1) ID number\n\n2) Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)\n\nTen real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:\n\n* radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)\n* texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)\n* perimeter\n* area\n* smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)\n* compactness (perimeter^2 \/ area - 1.0)\n* concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)\n* concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)\n* symmetry\n* fractal dimension (\"coastline approximation\" - 1)","7c15fe24":"### Load Dataset","30232bfb":"### Describe Data","e3ae39d8":"### Prediction","979fe29a":"## Logistic Regression\n\n### Create Model & Fit","ae2785a0":"### Metrics"}}
