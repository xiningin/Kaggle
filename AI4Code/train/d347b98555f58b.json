Without using the 12 leads, detecting AF cases only using height, weight, age, etc. is not persuading the cardiology physicians. Therefore, we generated a dataset that includes all the features from the numpy file and 14 features from the csv file. However, to reduce the size of the dataset that makes it easier to train the model, we only keep 700 rows instead of 5000 rows from the numpy file. The final dataset has a total of 4,319,176 observations and 26 variables.

AF symptoms often include heart palpitations, shortness of breath and weakness. AF is also independently associated with a significantly greater risk of mortality. For instance, AF patients have a 46% greater risk of mortality than patients without AF and the rate of mortality is 40% among new patients diagnosed with AF. Around 15-30% of patients are asymptomatic, which is of concern as AF is a major risk factor for stroke. \n\nAs AF progresses, patients are more likely to experience greater impairments in their quality of life, such as increased pain and discomfort. Early detection and appropriate management reduce stroke risk by two-thirds. As a result, early detection of AF is important to ensure prompt and adequate management which not only aims to control symptoms but to avoid later complications.","b7fd57ab":"### 2.
