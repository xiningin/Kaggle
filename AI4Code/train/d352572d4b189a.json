another set of numbers from the channel of the same size as the kernel and **another scalar is generated.**\n\n3.This repeatedly takes place until all such possible smaller matrices are multiplied

**information loss** and here comes into the picture a technique known as \"**Padding**\", which is used to conserve the size of the original matrix.\n\nWhat padding does is it adds additional cells
