How many categories do age & generation have?","6ca4354e":"Some interesting observations :\n1. The oldest age group has the most suicide rates throughout history\n1. The suicide rates are pretty uniformly increasing\/decreasing across the age-groups; so good or bad mental health environment has affected all age-groups similarly (although more for the oldest age-group)\n1. Males have suicide rate increases\/decreases over time, but that's less pronounced for female suicide rates & definitely doesn't match up when male suicide rates increase\/decrease.
