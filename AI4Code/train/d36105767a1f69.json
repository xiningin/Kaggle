Also by considering columns with more than 2000 vote_count does not change the impression. Furthermore, the corralation does not indicate that higher vote counts result in higher vote averages.\n\n## limitations \n1-all results are limited to this dataset <br>\n2-There is no normalization or exchange rate or currency conversion is considered during this analysis and our analysis is limited to the numerical values of revenue.<>\n3-alot of missing values that can make results not very accurate<br>\n","1d7caedd":"<a id='eda'><\/a>\n## Exploratory Data Analysis\n\n### what is the highest five movies with profit ?","2d47fa53":"### The most five famous directors in the data set","72eecb29":"### what director make most profits","a500b9e5":" ### Did movies with higher vote count received a better rating?","cd0d7c5c":"### drop duplicate rows","a0c4f9cb":"\n# Project: TMDB-movies\n\n## Table of Contents\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#intro\">Introduction<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#wrangling\">Data Wrangling<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#eda\">Exploratory Data Analysis<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#conclusions\">Conclusions<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>","0effa0f0":"### create profit column","f228a758":"## Data wrangling observations\n\n### after loading and investigating the data i will make the following changes :<br>\n\n1-remove duplicates<br>\n2-remove unused rows<br>\n3-create new column called profit to help in analyzing data more accuratly <br>\n4-Replacing zero with mean in runtime column.","72da205e":"<a id='wrangling'><\/a>\n## Data Wrangling","55886295":"### replace zero with mean in runtime","dde2a629":"### Drop the columns that i will not use in analyzing ","4baf89ea":"<a id='intro'><\/a>\n## Introduction\n\n i will use TMDB dataset which contains data about ten thousand movies from 1965 to 2015 each row contain data about certain movie the data contains information about<br> \n .release date<br>\n .original name<br>\n .budget<br>\n .revenue<br>\n .cast<br>\n .director<br>\n etc\n \n ## questions to answer\n \n 1.what is the highest five movies according to profit ?<br>\n 2.the most famous directors ?<br>\n 3.top five directors that make most profits?<br>\n 4.Do number of movies increase by time?<br>\n 5.Did movies with higher vote count received a better rating?\n ","0dd1c18a":"### Do number of movies increase by time","175b7e86":"\n### load the data and see their structure"}}
