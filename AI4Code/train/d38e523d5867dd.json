Analyzing full-text may reveal additional information.\n- Results can be fed into a document summarization algorithm so results can be more focussed even further\n- Further improvements in how data is presented with a more advanced user interface can be beneficial\n\n\n# Methodology\nData sources:\n- [CORD-19 Research Papers](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/allen-institute-for-ai\/CORD-19-research-challenge)\n- [COVID-19 Public Media Dataset](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/jannalipenkova\/covid19-public-media-dataset)\n\nTo build the corpus, the title and the content from both data soucres are combined (only the first 3,000 characters are used). The task questions were used as search queries for relevant documents in the corpus. For each document in the corpus and search query pair, the word vectors are retrieved from the GoogleNews word embeddings and the cosine distance is calculated. The top documents that match each query are shown in this notebook together with a summary of results presented as a WordCloud image. Additional results are available as CSV files.\n\nI experimented with using the Word Mover's Distance measure as an alternative similarity measure to cosine distance however, it proved to be a lot slower and it was difficult to objectively decide if the results were better than cosine distance. I also tried using LDA (latent dirichlet allocation) to identify the major topics in the results but I decided to use WordClouds instead because it is more visually appealing and more keywords are highlighted.\n\n\nI hope that the findings from this notebook can help inform researchers and curious minds about the ongoing COVID-19 research. I want to thank the researchers, competition organizers, Kaggle and the dataset providers for making this work possible.","0f43aa50":"# Ethical and social science considerations","4b01b66a":"# Burden of responding to the outbreak and implementing public health measures affects the physical and psychological health of those providing care for Covid-19 patients","f81970bc":"# Prepare data\n\nGather title and abstract from COVID19 articles and titles from news upto a maximum number of characters.\n","d65db5c7":"# Sustained education, access, and capacity building in the area of ethics"}}
