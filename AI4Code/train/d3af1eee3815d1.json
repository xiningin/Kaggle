MinMaxScaler will retain it only if the min value is 0, We can understand this property of scaling transformers when we look at there functions, StandardScaler subtracts mean of all values by the value being scaled in numerator, but MinMaxScaler subtracts the min value by the value being scaled, hence if we are scaling 0 and 0 is the min value we retain 0, But that wont be the case for the StandardScaler....

But atleast we know what we wish to check out by asking this question to our model that what it likes and what it does not(*More on this in Data set creation section*)!! \n\nIf we wish to use the feature as above, we will have to perform Ordinal encoding, where we encode the higher fare category with higher numeric value, for eg:- (-0.001, 7.55] -> 1, (7.55, 7.854] -> 2, (7.854, 8.05] -> 3 and so on. \n\n**Warning**:-\n\nWe can use LabelEncoder from scikit learn api to perform ordinal encoding only because there is order already present in our category which can be correctly understood by the LabelEncoder. But if the order present cannot be understood by the LabelEncoder for eg: Freezing, Cold, Warm, Hot, Lava Hot will be encoded as 2, 1, 5, 3, 4 on the basis of alphabetical order, which is not the correct order for this ordinal feature, it should be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5!! \n\n**Always beware of this trap!!!**","5bc19de5":"In the data provided to us, each individual has a SibSp and Parch, so if we add these features together for an individual and add 1 to it, 1 being the individual themself, we can create a new feature Family_size.\n\nIt is an important feature as it reveals that passengers with family size 2 - 4 had a better survival rate than passengers travelling alone or who had larger families.","7ad6e259":"The feature looks more balanced now and we can see that now we can say that deck 'M' is the deck where most of the pclass 2 and 3 are present whereas deck ABC is where most pclass 1 are present. We can see from the plots that deck DE had the highest survival rate!!! and deck 'M' has the lowest survival rate. \n\nThe great thing about this simplification from 'Cabin' to 'Deck' is that we have cornered the Pclass 2 and 3 passengers which had the lowest survival rates in new deck M we created!! in all the other decks it seems that they had better chance of survival!! Compare the **Deck-Pclass Proportions** and the **Deck Survival rate**, you can clearly see that those few Pclass 2 and 3 passenger in deck DE and FG have good survival chance, most of the Pclass 2 and 3 passengers are in the Deck 'M' and their survival rate is not good!!\n\nThis feature helps to harness this pattern!!!","70fdb8a1":"we passed in the max depth of 4 as we found in the last plot to get a better estimate of learning rate as per max depth 4, from the above plots lower learning rates look good!! you can also see that as number of trees increase the accuracy goes down.","8c272009":"From the above plot, max_depth of 3 - 4 looks good!!","33336bff":"### Logistic Regression","2ea53bc9":"### KNearestNeighbor","52ecf6f1":"This kernel serves as a **beginner tutorial and basic guideline** for approaching the Exploratory data analysis and Feature enginnering.

But it is deterimental for beginners to see such practice in action, developing the habit to combine test and train datasets is easy, the pros who do it in there kernels already now the implications, but a beginner does not. So i wanted to just point this out before you begin going through the kernel, We have avoided combining test and training dataset in EDA.","18035c14":" ***If you found it helpful, upvote!!***\n \n ***If you have forked the kernel and not upvoted yet, then show the support by upvoting :)***\n \n ***Please leave you constructive criticism and suggestion in comments below!!***","22e628ec":"For the titanc dataset many have observed that binning the continuous features helped improve the results slightly, as you can see that binning can let you express the survival chances a little better and in a simpler way, So always test this out with other datasets you work with and test out whether it helps or not!!","04f82d1f":"One way to impute values would be to just fill in the Cabins using the proportions as shown above. The missing values for Cabins in Pclass 1 as we see in the right plot, are less than all the other classes and these missing values will be imputed into the Cabins A,B,C,D,E only as they are the only Cabins where the Pclass 1 passengers are present, depending upon the already available Pclass 1 passenger propotions in these Cabins as shown left plot, But imputing values like this will create noise in already available information!! We might get a great result if the missing values got imputed correctly, But that will depend upon luck. So we should just impute the missing value as 'missing', atleast we retain the already available information free of noise.\n\nWe should also just simplify this feature and Combine Cabin A, B, C as deck ABC and D, E as DE and F, G as FG.","bd5557cd":"Yup, things look simpler and neat!! But again, it looks good to us but model might not find it as helpful as we think, maybe it could have found patterns with those family size numbers and some other feature, which it would not be able to harness as easily now, you never know... what we can be sure about is that we have made the feature simpler, if we one hot encode it we will have fewer dimensions, which is a good thing. Lets say we had many features which had to be one hot encoded but there cardinality(number of different categories in categorical feature) was high, label encoding was not an option and if we one hot encoded the feature we would be struck by curse of dimensionality, in such case if all the categorical features could be simplified in such a easy, beautiful way, nothing like that!!\n\nBut we do not have that problem at present, we have a small dataset and not aot of features with high cardinality, so we will have to figure out whether this feature helps or not.
