(If this look unfamiliar to you, check out [yesterday's challenge](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/rtatman\/data-cleaning-challenge-character-encodings\/).) ","3b8620b1":"Excellent! Now we only have \"d.i khan\" in our dataframe and we didn't have to change anything by hand. ","f8bea83f":"We can see that two of the items in the cities are very close to \"d.i khan\": \"d. i khan\" and \"d.i khan\". We can also see the \"d.g khan\", which is a seperate city, has a ratio of 88. Since we don't want to replace \"d.g khan\" with \"d.i khan\", let's replace all rows in our City column that have a ratio of > 90 with \"d. i khan\". \n\nTo do this, I'm going to write a function. (It's a good idea to write a general purpose function you can reuse if you think you might have to do a specific task more than once or twice. This keeps you from having to copy and paste code too often, which saves time and can help prevent mistakes.)","cdf71aa2":"Just looking at this, I can see some problems due to inconsistent data entry: 'Lahore' and 'Lahore ', for example, or 'Lakki Marwat' and 'Lakki marwat'.\n\nThe first thing I'm going to do is make everything lower case (I can change it back at the end if I like) and remove any white spaces at the beginning and end of cells. Inconsistencies in capitalizations and trailing white spaces are very common in text data and you can fix a good 80% of your text data entry inconsistencies by doing this.","1861d8c7":"It does look like there are some remaining inconsistencies: 'd. i khan' and 'd.i khan' should probably be the same. (I [looked it up](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_most_populous_cities_in_Pakistan) and 'd.g khan' is a seperate city, so I shouldn't combine those.) \n\nI'm going to use the [fuzzywuzzy](https:\/\/github.com\/seatgeek\/fuzzywuzzy) package to help identify which string are closest to each other. This dataset is small enough that we could probably could correct errors by hand, but that approach doesn't scale well. (Would you want to correct a thousand errors by hand? What about ten thousand? Automating things as early as possible is generally a good idea. Plus, it\u2019s fun! :)\n\n> **Fuzzy matching:** The process of automatically finding text strings that are very similar to the target string. In general, a string is considered \"closer\" to another one the fewer characters you'd need to change if you were transforming one string into another. So \"apple\" and \"snapple\" are two changes away from each other (add \"s\" and \"n\") while \"in\" and \"on\" and one change away (rplace \"i\" with \"o\"). You won't always be able to rely on fuzzy matching 100%, but it will usually end up saving you at least a little time.\n\nFuzzywuzzy returns a ratio given two strings. The closer the ratio is to 100, the smaller the edit distance between the two strings. Here, we're going to get the ten strings from our list of cities that have the closest distance to \"d.i khan\".","dee573ad":"And now let's can check the unique values in our City column again and make sure we've tidied up d.i khan correctly.","75eee5d7":"When I tried to read in the `PakistanSuicideAttacks Ver 11 (30-November-2017).csv`file the first time, I got a character encoding error, so I'm going to quickly check out what the encoding should be...","bbd849a4":"# Get our environment set up\n________\n\nThe first thing we'll need to do is load in the libraries we'll be using. Not our datasets, though: we'll get to those later!\n\n> **Important!** Make sure you run this cell yourself or the rest of your code won't work!","f1af599b":"Next we're going to tackle more difficult inconsistencies.","457fe25d":"# Use fuzzy matching to correct inconsistent data entry\n___\n\nAlright, let's take another look at the city column and see if there's any more data cleaning we need to do.","8d394fc1":"Now that we have a function, we can put it to the test!"}}
