And try to minimize the error as much as possible.\n\nIn statistics, linear regression is a linear approach to modelling the relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables (also known as dependent and independent variables).\n![](https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/524\/1*h9jL8DpeRc13E3LBGZ-heg.png)","1abcb7ba":"# Data visualization","5c1248ca":"# **Introduction**\n\n### hello everyone, in this notebook iam trying to play with 'LinearRegression' model of scikit library with a basic data set.\n\n","31fe4856":"creating linear regression object","3c45d3f8":"# regression equation\n![](https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/788\/1*wdhvF5Vax_9FULipI4N6Eg.png)","2bf06be8":"# libraries\nI'm going to be using the LinearRegression feature from scikit-learn because that's what this whole dataset is about!\n\nAnd of course, I imported pandas, numpy, and matplotlib to read the csv files and visualize the data.\n"}}
