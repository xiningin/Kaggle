High blood pressure that occurs with other conditions, such as obesity, high cholesterol or diabetes, increases your risk even more.\n\n**3. *High blood cholesterol or triglyceride levels.***\n\nA high level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (\"bad\" cholesterol) is most likely to narrow arteries. A high level of triglycerides, a type of blood fat related to your diet, also increases your risk of a heart attack. However, a high level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (\"good\" cholesterol) may lower your risk.\n\n**4. *Obesity.***\n\nObesity is linked with high blood cholesterol levels, high triglyceride levels, high blood pressure and diabetes. Losing just 10% of your body weight can lower this risk.\n\n**5. *Diabetes.***\n\nNot producing enough of a hormone secreted by your pancreas (insulin) or not responding to insulin properly causes your body's blood sugar levels to rise, increasing your risk of a heart attack.\n\n**6. *Metabolic syndrome.***\n\nThis syndrome occurs when you have obesity, high blood pressure and high blood sugar. Having metabolic syndrome makes you twice as likely to develop heart disease than if you don't have it.\n\n**7. *Family history of heart attacks.***\n\nIf your siblings, parents or grandparents have had early heart attacks (by age 55 for males and by age 65 for females), you might be at increased risk.\n\n**8. *Lack of physical activity.***\n\nBeing inactive contributes to high blood cholesterol levels and obesity. People who exercise regularly have better heart health, including lower blood pressure.\n","902c1422":"![heart_attack.jpg](attachment:20c65888-5461-42d5-b321-fa0dd79477c9.jpg)","6b790600":"# Problem Statement. \ud83c\udf83\n\n#### Know the data.\nThis is a **classification problem**.
