In creating my base classifiers, I will only use the models already present in the Sklearn library and therefore only extend the class for that.\n\n**def init** : Python standard for invoking the default constructor for the class. This means that when you want to create an object (classifier), you have to give it the parameters of clf (what sklearn classifier you want), seed (random seed) and params (parameters for the classifiers).\n\nThe rest of the code are simply methods of the class which simply call the corresponding methods already existing within the sklearn classifiers. Essentially, we have created a wrapper class to extend the various Sklearn classifiers so that this should help us reduce having to write the same code over and over when we implement multiple learners to our stacker.","dbb71e81":"Just a quick run down of the XGBoost parameters used in the model:\n\n**max_depth** : How deep you want to grow your tree.

This is good from a point of view of feeding these features into your learning model because this means that there isn't much redundant or superfluous data in our training set and we are happy that each feature carries with it some unique information. Here are two most correlated features are that of Family size and Parch (Parents and Children). I'll still leave both features in for the purposes of this exercise.\n\n**Pairplots**\n\nFinally let us generate some pairplots to observe the distribution of data from one feature to the other. Once again we use Seaborn to help us.","357eb8e7":"There have been quite a few articles and Kaggle competition winner stories about the merits of having trained models that are more uncorrelated with one another producing better scores.","acb6ff8d":"**Producing the Submission file**\n\nFinally having trained and fit all our first-level and second-level models, we can now output the predictions into the proper format for submission to the Titanic competition as follows:","440ed151":"**First-level output as new features**\n\nHaving now obtained our first-level predictions, one can think of it as essentially building a new set of features to be used as training data for the next classifier.

You hear of ensembles created at the highest level of Kaggle competitions which involves monstrous combinations of stacked classifiers as well as levels of stacking which go to more than 2 levels. \n\nSome additional steps that may be taken to improve one's score could be:\n\n 1.

In a nutshell stacking uses as a first-level (base), the predictions of a few basic classifiers and then uses another model at the second-level to predict the output from the earlier first-level predictions.\n\nThe Titanic dataset is a prime candidate for introducing this concept as many newcomers to Kaggle start out here. Furthermore even though stacking has been responsible for many a team winning Kaggle competitions there seems to be a dearth of kernels on this topic so I hope this notebook can fill somewhat of that void.\n\nI myself am quite a newcomer to the Kaggle scene as well and the first proper ensembling\/stacking script that I managed to chance upon and study was one written in the AllState Severity Claims competition by the great Faron. The material in this notebook borrows heavily from Faron's script although ported to factor in ensembles of classifiers whilst his was ensembles of regressors. Anyway please check out his script here:\n\n[Stacking Starter][1] : by Faron \n\n\nNow onto the notebook at hand and I hope that it manages to do justice and convey the concept of ensembling in an intuitive and concise manner.  My other standalone Kaggle [script][2] which implements exactly the same ensembling steps (albeit with different parameters) discussed below gives a Public LB score of 0.808 which is good enough to get to the top 9% and runs just under 4 minutes. Therefore I am pretty sure there is a lot of room to improve and add on to that script. Anyways please feel free to leave me any comments with regards to how I can improve\n\n\n  [1]: https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/mmueller\/allstate-claims-severity\/stacking-starter\/run\/390867\n  [2]: https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/arthurtok\/titanic\/simple-stacking-with-xgboost-0-808","66a45f14":"**Pearson Correlation Heatmap**\n\nlet us generate some correlation plots of the features to see how related one feature is to the next.

However one cannot simply train the base models on the full training data, generate predictions on the full test set and then output these for the second-level training. This runs the risk of your base model predictions already having \"seen\" the test set and therefore overfitting when feeding these predictions.","31fe75c1":"### Conclusion\n\nI have this notebook has been helpful somewhat in introducing a working script for stacking learning models.

In short, a class helps to extend some code\/program for creating objects (variables for old-school peeps) as well as to implement functions and methods specific to that class.\n\nIn the section of code below, we essentially write a class *SklearnHelper* that allows one to extend the inbuilt methods (such as train, predict and fit) common to all the Sklearn classifiers. Therefore this cuts out redundancy as  won't need to write the same methods five times if we wanted to invoke five different classifiers.","13cfd6b3":"All right so now having cleaned the features and extracted relevant information and dropped the categorical columns our features should now all be numeric, a format suitable to feed into our Machine Learning models.
