How did the feature(s) of interest vary with other features in the dataset?\n\n#### Men's participation in Olympics has slightly increase through years, but women really did it they have amazing level of increasing. They awarded medals in 2008 double the awarded in 1976.\n#### It's was really a big shock that Egyptian women participation in Olympics is ZERO!!!!\n#### Egyptian athletes were awarded only 1 medal in first 7 years then they reach their peak in 2004 with 5 medals and recede back again in 2008 with only 1 medal.\n#### Performance of athletes (Women\/Men) playing Tennis is nearly the same.\n#### Women started to Weightlifting in 2000, but they showed up with number of awarded medals close to the men's awarded number.\n#### Medals awarded in Weightlifting were constant from 1976 to 1996, until Weightlifting sport showed up in 2000 to increase by one third.\n\n### Did you observe any interesting relationships between the other features (not the main feature(s) of interest)?\n#### It seems that USA Olympics contribution in 1980 is very low.

","cb6fcab0":"### Discuss the distribution(s) of your variable(s) of interest. Were there any unusual points? Did you need to perform any transformations?\n\n> Everything seems normal contribution in olympics increases overtime, maybe it's due to the increase of population over world or because people become more interesting in sports.\n\n### Of the features you investigated, were there any unusual distributions? Did you perform any operations on the data to tidy, adjust, or change the form of the data? If so, why did you do this?\n\n> \"United States\" awarded medals are more than \"Soviet Union\" by nearly 1000 medals awarded. It's really huge diffrence between the first 2 places, but may be it's due to the population in US is the largest in the world.
