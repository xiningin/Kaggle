Extrapolation is essential, as the noise values in test set are beyond the values in training data.","649596e7":"Plotting the individual noise levels.","71411558":"### Noise shift at the 3 million mark\n\nBuilding on the work of @rkaveland [here](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/kaaveland\/tps202112-ctgan-artifacts-chunks?kernelSessionId=82663352) and @ambrosm [here](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/tabular-playground-series-dec-2021\/discussion\/292381)\n\nThe Wilderness_Area features are noisy. One expects every sample to be in exactly one Wilderness Area, but in the data we see samples that have 0, 1, or more areas assigned. \n\nI noticed the noise model shifts right around the 3 million sample mark in the train data, and seems to remain consistent throughout the test data.\n\nDefine Noise as the sum of the assigned Wilderness Areas minus one. Then plot the cumulative sum. It's pretty dramatic.\n"}}
