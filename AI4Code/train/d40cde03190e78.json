Here, image is used as the input, where the useful information returns as the output **(Features)**.\n\nProcessing can be used to improve the quality of your image, or to help you extract useful information from it to use in Machine learning.\n\nMany advanced Image Processing methods leverage Machine Learning Models like **Deep Neural Networks** to transform images on a variety of tasks, like **Image Enhancement**, **Noise Removal**, or **Image Restoration** for computer vision tasks. \n\n**Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** take in an input image and use filters on it, in a way that it learns to do things like object detection, image segmentation and classification.\n\nFor image processing we will use OpenCV,it is a library of Python bindings designed to solve computer vision problems. It can process images and videos to identify objects, faces, or even the handwriting of a human.\n\nSteps involved in Image Processing are :-\n1) Image Enhancement\n\n2) Noise Removal\n\n3) Image Restoration\n\n4) Image Segmentation\n\nWe will script some basic steps on Image Processing."}}
