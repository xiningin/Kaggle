Infact this is the second worst level after 2004 (Also it is important to note that city has grown a lot bigger from 2004 to 2019). \n\nThe city has just had 1000 mcft of water at the beginning of the summer which is much worser than the 2017 levels of 1500 mcft. So just by looking at the very low water level, the water scarcity could have been forecasted without even computing the consumption level per day. \n\n## Current Sources of Water for the City\n\nWith the major source of water for the city fully dry, the water needs is being *partially* met by other sources mentioned above. Of the estimated need of 830 MLD (Million Liters per Day) of water, 500 MLD is being met by following resources.\n\n![Current Water Sources](https:\/\/www.thehindu.com\/news\/cities\/chennai\/szuw7e\/article28023480.ece\/ALTERNATES\/FREE_460\/TH18-city-reservoirscol)\n","454286d2":"## Chennai & its water sources\n\n**Chennai** also known as Madras, is the capital of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Located on the Coromandel Coast off the Bay of Bengal, it is the biggest cultural, economic and educational centre of south India. Population of Chennai is close to 9 million and is the 36th largest urban area by population in the world - Wikipedia\n\n![Chennai](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/c\/c4\/Chennai_Montage.jpg\/500px-Chennai_Montage.jpg)\n\nChennai is entirely dependent on ground water resources to meet its water needs. Ground water resources in Chennai are replenished by rain water and the city's average rainfall is 1,276 mm[1](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Water_management_in_Chennai). \n\nFollowing are the major sources of water supply for Chennai city.\n1. Four major reservoirs in Red Hills, Cholavaram, Poondi and Chembarambakkam\n2. Cauvery water from Veeranam lake\n3. Desalination plants at Nemelli and Minjur\n4. Aquifers in Neyveli, Minjur and Panchetty\n5. Tamaraipakkam, Poondi and Minjur Agriculture wells \n6. CMWSSB Boreweels\n7. Retteri lake\n\nThe above one is also roughly the descending order in which the contribution is made to overall fresh water requirements of the city. In addition to this, people make use of borewells and private tankers for their water needs. \n\nCurrently (July 2019), Chennai is facing an acute water shortage due to shortage of rainfall for the past three years (and we had one of the worst floods in history the year before that!). As a result, the water in these resources are depleting along with the groundwater level. This [video](https:\/\/youtu.be\/iaG7kRcSxwA) will give an idea about the current state.  \n\nIn this notebook, let us explore the data of different water resources available.","259e4089":"**Inferences:**\n\n* Looks like the city gets some rains in the month of June, July, August and September due to south west monsoon. \n* Major rainfall happens during October and November of every year which is due to North-east monsoon.\n* During the initial years rain from north-east monsoon is much higher than south-west monsoon. But seems like last few years, they both are similar (reduction in rains from north-east monsoon).\n* We have got some good rains in August and September 2019, but the water reservoir levels are yet to go up.\n\n\n","65b34a4c":"Thanks to [The Hindu](https:\/\/www.thehindu.com\/news\/cities\/chennai\/water-supply-in-city-cut-to-525-from-830-mld-hc-told\/article28023481.ece) for the above picture. \n\nOf the current sources of water supply, [Veeranam lake supply](http:\/\/123.63.203.150\/veeranam.htm) is having some water and is helping to cope up with the water needs of the city.\n\n\n## Conclusion:\n\nThe water scarcity of 2004 has brought Veeranam lake as the new means of water supply for the city. \n\nHopefully, this current scarcity (July 2019) will bring more additional sources of water for the ailing city. The city has grown a lot in the last 15 years and so need additional water resources to manage the needs. \n\nThe city needs to devise better scarcity control methods by estimating the needs ahead of time.

There is no water in any of the major reservoirs\n2. Reservoirs depend on rain for their replenishment. \n\nNext we can look at the rainfall data in these reservoir regions to analyze the rainfall months. Let us take the total monthly rainfall in these reservoir regions and plot the same.\n","8e279d7b":"## Water shortage estimation\n\nSince all the data is available in the public domain, would it be possible to do some analysis and see whether we can estimate this water shortage ahead of time so as to plan for it?\n\nFirst let us just take a simple step to compare the sum of water levels at the beginning of summer (Let us take February 1st of every year). This is because there will not be any replenishment till the next monsson and the amount of water stored in the four reservoirs itself will be clear indicator of how long can the water be managed during summer and whether there should be some backup plans.","1f155296":"**Inference:**\n\n* We could clearly see that evey year there is a decremental phase and a replenishment phase (mainly during october to december)\n* There was a very bad water scarcity phase seen during 2004.\n* We can also see a bad phase during 2014-15 but there was to water availability in two reservoirs (Redhills and Chembarambakkam) and so it was a savior.\n* Now coming to recent times, the data shows that there is no water availability in any of the four major reservoirs.\n\n## Combined Water Levels in Four Major Reservoirs\n\nFor better understanding, let us sum up the water availability in all four reservoirs and then make the plot.","be1e6f3f":"Firstly, we have data about the water availability in four major reservoirs that supply water to Chennai.
