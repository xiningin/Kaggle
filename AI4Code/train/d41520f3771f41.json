I did not know about it after applying machine learning models. I saw every models are showing only 'True Negative' and 'False Negative' values in classification report and all models are showing more than 90%  of accuracy. Then I understood my feature is not balanced. After that for making it balanced I used 'Random Over Sampler' method for 'over sampling' the data and I applied it because I didn't want to loose any data that's why I didn't use 'under sampling'. After applying this again I fit the data into models. Here, I used four models for which one of them is giving higher  accuracy and f1-score.\n#####  My first reason to choose \"K-Neighbors Classifier\" is \"K-Neighbors Classifier\" is simple and easy to implement. There\u2019s no need to tune several parameters, or make additional assumptions and it is versatile. It can be used for classification, regression.  My second reason for choosing it is that here, I saw \"K-Neighbors Classifier\" is giving more than 97% of accuracy and f1-score with the k value of 2.
