The first number, the **count**,  shows how many rows have non-missing values.  \n\nMissing values arise for many reasons. For example, the size of the 2nd bedroom wouldn't be collected when surveying a 1 bedroom house. We'll come back to the topic of missing data.\n\nThe second value is the **mean**, which is the average.  Under that, **std** is the standard deviation, which measures how numerically spread out the values are.\n\nTo interpret the **min**, **25%**, **50%**, **75%** and **max** values, imagine sorting each column from lowest to highest value.  The first (smallest) value is the min.  If you go a quarter way through the list, you'll find a number that is bigger than 25% of the values and smaller than 75% of the values.  That is the **25%** value (pronounced \"25th percentile\").  The 50th and 75th percentiles are defined analogously, and the **max** is the largest number.\n\n--- \n\n# Your Turn\nGet started with your **[first coding exercise](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/kernels\/fork\/1258954)**\n\n---\n**[Course Home Page](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/learn\/machine-learning)**\n","b1b36c78":"**[Machine Learning Course Home Page](kaggle.com\/learn\/machine-learning)**\n\n---\n# Using Pandas to Get Familiar With Your Data\n\nThe first step in any machine learning project is familiarize yourself with the data.  You'll use the Pandas library for this.  Pandas is the primary tool data scientists use for exploring and manipulating data.  Most people abbreviate pandas in their code as `pd`.  We do this with the command","76d83657":"The most important part of the Pandas library is the DataFrame.  A DataFrame holds the type of data you might think of as a table. This is similar to a sheet in Excel, or a table in a SQL database. \n\nPandas has powerful methods for most things you'll want to do with this type of data.  \n\nAs an example, we'll looking at data about home prices in Melbourne, Australia. In the hands-on exercises, you will apply the same processes to a new dataset, which has home prices in Iowa.\n\nThe example (Melbourne) data is at the file path **`..\/input\/melbourne-housing-snapshot\/melb_data.csv`**.\n\nWe load and explore the data with the following commands:"}}
