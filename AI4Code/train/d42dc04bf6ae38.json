The closest country is India with 140 billionaires. This huge mismatch between US & China and the rest of the world could be because these two countries have the highest GDPs in the world and have been the two most dominant economies in the last 10 to 15 years. Having strong economies with consistent economic growth entails massive business and trade opportunities, hence creating a platform for individuals and business to flourish and progress therefore producing billionaires and business with huge market shares and net worth.\n\nNow that we know in which countries and regions most billionaires are situated, we can further break down this analysis to find out what cities do most billionaires reside in.","08aae1b0":"**Removing \"Citizenship\" from the dataset**","ff9bd103":"Billionaires in the dataset have children ranging from 1 to 23.
