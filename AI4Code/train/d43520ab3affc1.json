The repositories with no language are guides and books kind and they take the second place in the most common repositries in the dataset.\n- There are 20 different languages, and eleven of them got in the top 100 with only one repository.\n- The most starred repositorie is written in JS and the most forked one is C++ as shown in the scatter plots"}}
