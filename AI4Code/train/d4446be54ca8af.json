Save the results to a variable called `predictions`.","71d51165":"## Step 2: Create X\nNow you will create a DataFrame called `X` holding the predictive features.\n\nSince you want only some columns from the original data, you'll first create a list with the names of the columns you want in `X`.\n\nYou'll use just the following columns in the list (you can copy and paste the whole list to save some typing, though you'll still need to add quotes):\n    * LotArea\n    * YearBuilt\n    * 1stFlrSF\n    * 2ndFlrSF\n    * FullBath\n    * BedroomAbvGr\n    * TotRmsAbvGrd\n\nAfter you've created that list of features, use it to create the DataFrame that you'll use to fit the model.","f3f2fc3b":"## Recap\nSo far, you have loaded your data and reviewed it with the following code.
