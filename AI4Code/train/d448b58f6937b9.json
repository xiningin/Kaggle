What do we know about the virus origin and management measures at the human-animal interface?\n\n### Specifically, we want to know what the literature reports about:\n\n* Real-time tracking of whole genomes and a mechanism for coordinating the rapid dissemination of that information to inform the development of diagnostics and therapeutics and to track variations of the virus over time.\n* Access to geographic and temporal diverse sample sets to understand geographic distribution and genomic differences, and determine whether there is more than one strain in circulation. Multi-lateral agreements such as the Nagoya Protocol could be leveraged.\n* Evidence that livestock could be infected (e.g., field surveillance, genetic sequencing, receptor binding) and serve as a reservoir after the epidemic appears to be over.\n* Evidence of whether farmers are infected, and whether farmers could have played a role in the origin.\n* Surveillance of mixed wildlife- livestock farms for SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses in Southeast Asia.\n* Experimental infections to test host range for this pathogen.\n* Animal host(s) and any evidence of continued spill-over to humans\n* Socioeconomic and behavioral risk factors for this spill-over\n* Sustainable risk reduction strategies"}}
