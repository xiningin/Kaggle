The above Heat Map shows that almost all of the features\/attributes given in the dataset are very less correlated with each other. This implies we must include all of the features, as we can only eliminate those features where the correlation of two or more features are very high.","99ec4791":"**Report for the First Patient**","88c0280d":"> This Heat Map, between Target and Maximum Heart Rate shows that the patients who are likely to suffer from heart diseases are having higher maximum heart rates whereas the patients who are not likely to suffer from any heart diseases are having lower maximum heart rates.\n>> This implies it is very important to keep our heart rates low, to keep ourselves healthy and safe from any dangerous heart diseases.","fd6255e7":"> The above Bivariate plot between cholestrol levels and target suggests that the Patients likely to suffer from heart diseases are having higher cholestrol levels in comparison to the patients with target 0(likely to not suffer from the heart diseases.\n>> Hence, we can infer from the above plot that the cholestrol levels plays an important role in determining heart diseases. We all must keep our cholestrol levels in control as possible.","857206e9":">In the above Boxen plot between Target and a Blood disorder called Thalessemia, It can be easily inferred that the patients suffering from heart diseases have low chances of also suffering from thalessemia in comparison to the patients who are less likely to suffer from the heart diseases. Hence, It is also a good feature to classify heart diseases.","35edc7f6":"## Data Visualizations","d6bd1556":"> Let's look at the Target, The dataset is quite balanced with almost equal no. of Positive and Negative Classes. Let's say the Positive Class says that the patient is suffering from the disease and the Negative class says that the patient is not suffering from the disease.","3cff9518":"**Shap Values**","7d75c5a2":"> The above Bivariate plot between Target and Number of Major Vessels, shows that the patients who are more likely to suffer from Heart diseases are having high values of Major Vessels wheras the patiets who are very less likely to suffer from any kind of heart diseases have very low values of Major Vessels.\n>> Hence, It is also helpful in determining the heart diseases, the more the number of vessels, the more is the chance of suffering from heart diseases.","f0f22630":"> The above plot is column bar chart representing target vs ECG Measurements(Electro Cardio Gram), The above plot shows that the more number of patients not likely to suffer from heart diseases are having restscg value 0 whereas more number of people have restecg value 1 in case of more likelihood of suffering from a heart disease.","39413f09":"## Model Explanation","50dce46d":"## Data Profiling","228a3294":"**Data Description**","db06be2a":"**Report for the Second Patient**","3d187901":"**Force Plot**","c7acec7d":"> The above Pie chart, whhich shows us the distribution of Gender in the Heart diseases. By looking at the plot, we can **assume** that Males are two times more likely to suffer from heart diseases in comparison to females.\n>> According to our study, From all the Entries in our dataset 68% of the patients are men whereas only 32% are women. More number of men took participation in heart disease check ups."}}
