To do that, we will add a new variable (column) to the dataset whose value is True if the video title has at least a capitalized word in it, and False otherwise\n\n","12bb7d2e":"Now we see that the majority of trending videos have 1 million views or less. Let's see the exact percentage of videos less than 1 million views","6722ea34":"Now we can see which days of the week had the largest numbers of trending videos","c85385f6":"We can see that title-length distribution resembles a normal distribution, where most videos have title lengths between 30 and 60 character approximately.\n\nNow let's draw a scatter plot between title length and number of views to see the relationship between these two variables","faa964c1":"The correlation map and correlation table above say that views and likes are highly positively correlated. Let's verify that by plotting a scatter plot between views and likes to visualize the relationship between these variables","77de74ef":"We can see that this video appeared on the list with two different titles","847f8070":"# Which channels have the largest number of trending videos?","45ff3d1a":"# Reading the dataset","e55f198e":"**Views histogram**\n\nlet's plot a histogram for the views column to take a look at its distribution: to see how many videos have between 10 million and 20 million views, how many videos have between 20 million and 30 million views, and so on.","0378f9b5":"We see for example that views and likes are highly positively correlated with a correlation value of 0.85; we see also a high positive correlation (0.80) between likes and comment count, and between dislikes and comment count (0.70).\n\nThere is some positive correlation between views and dislikes, between views and comment count, between likes and dislikes.\n\nNow let's visualize the correlation table above using a heatmap","d54605df":"# Describtion of numerical columns\nNow, let's see some statistical information about the numerical columns of our dataset","b76db10f":"# Description on non-numerical columns\nAfter we described numerical columns previously, we now describe non-numerical columns","f30867ee":"From the table above, we can see that there are 205 unique dates, which means that our dataset contains collected data about trending videos **over 205 days**.\n\nFrom video_id description, we can see that there are 40949 videos (which is expected because our dataset contains 40949 entries), but we can see also that there are only 6351 unique videos which means that some videos appeared on the trending videos list **on more than one day**. The table also tells us that the top frequent title is \"WE MADE OUR MOM CRY...HER DREAM CAME TRUE!\" and that it appeared 30 times on the trending videos list.\n\nBut there is something strange in the description table above: Because there are 6351 unique video IDs, we expect to have 6351 unique video titles also, because we assume that each ID is linked to a corresponding title. One possible interpretation is that a trending video had some title when it appeared on the trending list, then it appeared again on another day but with a modified title. Similar explaination applies for description column as well. For publish_time column, the unique values are less than 6351, but there is nothing strange here, because two different videos may be published at the same time.\n\nTo verify our interpretation for title column, let's take a look at an example where a trending video appeared more than once on the trending list but with different titles","e5c57425":"Let's get a closer look by eliminating entries with comment count larger than 200000 comment","598037e8":"# Trending videos and their publishing time\nAn example value of the publish_time column in our dataset is 2017-11-13T17:13:01.000Z. And according to information on this page: https:\/\/www.w3.org\/TR\/NOTE-datetime, this means that the date of publishing the video is 2017-11-13 and the time is 17:13:01 in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) time zone.\n\nLet's add two columns to represent the date and hour of publishing each video, then delete the original publish_time column because we will not need it anymore","b20a67f5":"We see that views and likes are truly positively correlated: as one increases, the other increases too\u2014mostly.\n\nAnother verification of the correlation matrix and map is the scatter plot we drew above between views and title length as it shows that there is no correlation between them.\n\n","a0cde935":"# Most common words in video titles\nLet's see if there are some words that are used significantly in trending video titles. We will display the 25 most common words in all trending video titles","fee2008d":"# Goals of the analysis\nWe want to answer questions like:\n\n* How many views do our trending videos have? Do most of them have a large number of views? Is having a large number of views required for a video to become trending?\n* The same questions above, but applied to likes and comment count instead of views.\n* Which video remained the most on the trendin-videos list?\n* How many trending videos contain a fully-capitalized word in their titles?\n* What are the lengths of trending video titles? Is this length related to the video becoming trendy?\n* How are views, likes, dislikes, comment count, title length, and other attributes correlate with (relate to) each other? How are they connected?\n* What are the most common words in trending video titles?\n* Which YouTube channels have the largest number of trending videos?\n* Which video category (e.g. Entertainment, Gaming, Comedy, etc.) has the largest number of trending videos?\n* When were trending videos published?

We notice also that words \"Video\", \"Trailer\", \"How\", and \"2018\" are common in trending video titles; each occured in 1613-1901 video titles.\n\nLet's draw a word cloud for the titles of our trending videos, which is a way to visualize most common words in the titles; the more common the word is, the bigger its font size is"}}
