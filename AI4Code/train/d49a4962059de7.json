Have a look.\n","ed8774f2":"## Basic String Operations\n### Changing case of String\nOne of the simple thing that we can do with string is to convert case of the words in string. In python, we have `title()`, `upper()` and `lower()` function to convert string in Title Case (first letter of each word is capital), UPPER CASE and lower case respectively.","176b0098":"## Integers\nIntegers are used to store whole numbers.  Let's have a look at how python manage integers and different operations can be performed on integers.","78c3d880":"### Remove (Strip) white space from string\nIn python we can remove white space using `strip()`, `rstrip()` and `lstrip()`.  Using `strip()` we can remove white space from left and right side of the string. If you want to remove white space from left and right then we have to use `lstrip()` and `rstsip()` respectively. ","6863b890":"### Combining string\nIt is always useful to combine multiple strings. In python, we can join (combine) string using plus (`+`) sign.","2874a967":"### Adding white space (tab or new line) to string\nIn python, white space means any non-printing space such as tab, new line and spaces. In python, we can add tab to our string using `\\t` and add new line using `\\n`.","1dd0bd13":"## Length of a list\nLike string you can find the length of a list using the `len()` method.

Python\u2019s simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Programmers are using python for differnrent use like; to develop games, build web applications, Apps and more.","b13275a9":"## Basic List Operation\nLike other data types we can perform some operations on list.

Have a look.","c76b0803":"## Comments\nComments are very useful in any programming language. The main purpose of writing comments is to explain what code supposed to do. In python, the hash symbol(`#`) indicates the comment. Any sentence following hash mark is comment.","2f740090":"### Length of the String\nIn python, `len()` function returns the number of character in the string.

Let's have a look at how to create list that contains same data types.","b9930038":"## Variables\nBasically you can say variable is a word that contains value.\nAt I hight level, each variable contains a value, each value is piece of information that is associated with the variable.\nFor example, if you want to store 1 in variable.","c303553c":"Today we learned Basics of python from Python Crash Course book. My goal for this 100 Days of Machine Learning Challenge is to learn machine learning form scratch and help others who want to start their journey in machine learning.

Apart from that python have special index -1, which is index of last element. Have a look.","4df8d7f2":"## Strings\nA string is simply series of characters. Anything inside single quote (') or double quotes (\") considered as string in python.","02fed1c9":"## Floats\nPython consider any number with decimal points as a float. In python, we can perform similar operations that we performed with integers. Let's have a look at it."}}
