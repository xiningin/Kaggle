The solutions of this equation are called **roots** of the cubic function.\n\n## Solving Equations\n\nSymPy\u2019s *solve()* function can be used to find solutions to equations. When you input an expression with a symbol representing a variable, such as $x$, *solve()* calculates the value of that symbol. This function always makes its calculation by assuming the expression you enter is equal to zero\u2014that is, it prints the value that, when substituted for the symbol, makes the entire expression equal zero. \n\n#### Example 1\n\nDetermine the roots of the cubic equation $2x^{3} + 3x^{2} \u2013 11x \u2013 6 = 0$"}}
