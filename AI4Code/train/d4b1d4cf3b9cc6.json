If you're unsure what to do with a loaded data file, Kaggle has some [great learning resources](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/dansbecker\/learning-materials-on-kaggle).","b230117e":"From there, you will find a list of files in the left sidebar.  It may look something like this.  \n![Imgur](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/wclghgC.png)\n\nIf you have many sets of files, it could be longer.  If you don't have any data files listed, click on the button to add a data file.\n\nTo get the path you'll need to load a file, just click on the filename in this list.  That causes the file's path to show up in the main window.  It will look something like this.\n\n![Imgur](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/0lkwpGl.png)\n\nIf you have a great memory, congrats.
