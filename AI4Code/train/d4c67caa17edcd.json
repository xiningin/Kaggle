So if k=3, for each sign, it'll return the 3 largest probabilities (out of a possible 43) and the correspoding class ids.\n\nTake this numpy array as an example. The values in the array represent predictions.

To meet specifications, the validation set accuracy will need to be at least 0.93. It is possible to get an even higher accuracy, but 0.93 is the minimum for a successful project submission. \n\nThere are various aspects to consider when thinking about this problem:\n\n- Neural network architecture (is the network over or underfitting?)\n- Play around preprocessing techniques (normalization, rgb to grayscale, etc)\n- Number of examples per label (some have more than others).\n- Generate fake data.\n\nHere is an example of a [published baseline model on this problem](http:\/\/yann.lecun.com\/exdb\/publis\/pdf\/sermanet-ijcnn-11.pdf).
