If you finish something like a notebook or whatever it might be, you might want to kick back and relax a little. You might even have a beer.\n\nA lot of people get very into beer and then get into brewing their own and then there are people that get very very into beer and start thinking about how to start their own brewery. I remember reading about this once a few years ago on some food blog. \n\n**Update**: I found the post! From [Serious Eats](http:\/\/drinks.seriouseats.com\/2014\/03\/challenges-of-opening-a-brewery-job-advice-beer-industry-collin-mcdonnell-henhouse.html):\n\n> If you're considering this line of work, you better be the kind of person who finds doing the dishes relaxing. Cleaning floors, cleaning tanks, cleaning hoses, cleaning kegs, cleaning glasses, cleaning drains, cleaning parts: every day in a brewery starts with cleaning and ends with cleaning. \n\nOne of the first things I'm learning is that you cleaning data is one of the things you'll just always be doing in data science. You probably already knew that. If that's the case, you're likely one of the many many many people ahead of me in this journey.\n\nSo the first step to gathering these insights is to clean your data.
