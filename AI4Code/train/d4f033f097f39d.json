published in New York Times. The article states - [Available here](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/04\/20\/opinion\/coronavirus-testing-pneumonia.html)\n\nPneumonia caused by the coronavirus has had a stunning impact on the city\u2019s hospital system. Normally an E.R. has a mix of patients with conditions ranging from the serious, such as heart attacks, strokes and traumatic injuries, to the nonlife-threatening, such as minor lacerations, intoxication, orthopedic injuries and migraine headaches.\n\nThese patients did not report any sensation of breathing problems, even though their chest X-rays showed diffuse pneumonia and their oxygen was below normal. We are just beginning to recognize that Covid pneumonia initially causes a form of oxygen deprivation we call \u201csilent hypoxia\u201d \u2014 \u201csilent\u201d because of its insidious, hard-to-detect nature.\n\nPneumonia is an infection of the lungs in which the air sacs fill with fluid or pus. Normally, patients develop chest discomfort, pain with breathing and other breathing problems. But when Covid pneumonia first strikes, patients don\u2019t feel short of breath, even as their oxygen levels fall. And by the time they do, they have alarmingly low oxygen levels and moderate-to-severe pneumonia (as seen on chest X-rays).\n\n\n**The above mentioned clinical figures are related to pneumonia ailments. This undetected figures, among populations can be a main source of deaths related to COVID-19. These clinical figures, might go undetected, becuase of which hospitalization is given to patients who become very serious, leading to death. Early detection of the figures above can be a good way to reduce the deaths through a significant number**","5c32e508":"<h3> Analysis of the gender and age figures via Graphs <\/h3>\n\nConstraints : As the above mentioned data is insufficient to draw out meaningful analyses, in this notebook I took help of open source tools like statista to analyze various trends of COVID-19 spread on the basis of gender and age. The below mentioned are the graphical analyses of various countries across globe and the spread of COVID-19 across population figures.","005e57ba":"# <a id='findings'><h3>The findings from the Analyses<\/h3><\/a>\n\n1. Median age tends to affect the cases. So for a city that has a higher median age, the cases tend to increase. \n\n2. Life expectancy also seems to affect the COVID-19 confirmed cases with a weak correlation. The effect is seen more prominent in males than in females. This weak correlation might highlight the medical facilities for the country. Further research to which is needed to be carried out.\n\n3. With the rise in tempertaure, the confirmed cases tend to slow down (negative correlation). The maximum number of cases has occured between a range on temperatures (from -4 to 17 deree celcius). The transmissons are substantially higher in colder regions and with the increase in temperature, transmissions trend to decrease. Hence, people in colder environments and cooler climatic conditions are much prone to the transmission of COVID-19. This effect isn't saw in general population data as the p-value is hgiher and we can't reject our null hypothesis.\n\n4. None of the figures like Smokers percentage in population, obesity, diabetics tend to affect the spread of COVID-19 Infections in US in general.\n\n5. A certain correaltion is observed with the number of confirmed cases in a county and the traffic congestion present for that county (as of 2020). The correaltion for the varibles are (0.613053). This might be significant as the quarantine and total isolation of people disallowing people movement across US Counties were late in comparison to countries like India\/Korea\/China\/Japan. Hence asymptomatic cases that were carrying the virus might had spread the same, as the moment weren't restricted and the congestion of traffic for the particular counties are high.\n\n6. For multiple countries elder population (above 50 years of age were more serious to covid-19 than the younger population. Although for the countries like India, where younger population contracted COVID-19, the death for the majority of the cases were observed in the elder population.)\n\n7.
