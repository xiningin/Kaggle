The company now operates more than 28,289 retail stores in 49 countries.\n\n# Content\n\nThis dataset includes a record for every Starbucks or subsidiary store location currently in operation as of Nov 2021\n\n# Acknowledgements\n\nThis data was scraped from the Starbucks store locator webpage (https:\/\/www.starbucks.com\/store-locator\/store\/)\n\nand it's updated data of https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/starbucks\/store-locations\n\n# Inspiration\n\nWhat city or country has the highest number of Starbucks stores per capita? What two Starbucks locations are the closest in proximity to one another? What location on Earth is farthest from a Starbucks? How has Starbucks expanded overseas?","e1648be1":"# Libraries"}}
