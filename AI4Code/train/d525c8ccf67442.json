Depending on which feature or features you chose, you may have ended up with a score significantly worse than the baseline. In that case, it's likely the extra information gained by the encoding couldn't make up for the loss of data used for the encoding.","fff43656":"---\n\n\n\n\n*Have questions or comments?

This will illustrate this importance of training fitting target encoders on data held-out from the training set.\n\nSo let's see what happens when we fit the encoder and the model on the *same* dataset. To emphasize how dramatic the overfitting can be, we'll mean-encode a feature that should have no relationship with `SalePrice`, a count: `0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...`.","88f4da7b":"And the distributions are almost exactly the same, too.\n\n# 3) Overfitting with Target Encoders\n\nBased on your understanding of how mean-encoding works, can you explain how XGBoost was able to get an almost a perfect fit after mean-encoding the count feature?","754a49da":"# 1) Choose Features for Encoding\n\nWhich features did you identify for target encoding?
