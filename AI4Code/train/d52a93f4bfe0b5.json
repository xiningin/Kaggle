One clear assumption could be that hardcover books cost more than paperback, simply because of the material which is used in making that type of book. Let us verify that by comparing the average price of each book type.","9bd16448":"Again, the most common word in a book's description with less than or equal to 200 pages is *python*! Is it that easy to explain Python with a book having less than or equal to 200 pages?! The irony here is, I can see both *simple and complex* in the wordcloud for books having less than or equal to 200 pages. Maybe, the books with the word *complex* in their description would just have really hard problems to solve? That's just an assumption, you are free to dive deeper into this.","8dcf47ef":"This shows that there is almost no correlation between price and rating, but there is a mildly strong correlation between price and number of pages in a book. That could be intuitive, as the number of pages increase, cost of manufacturing increases and hence the increase in price. But, what about ebooks?! Maybe the author's effort is also taken into consideration? Let's look at a regression plot to visualise the relation between price and number of pages.","aedc7485":"This verifies our assumption and it is actually true in the real world that books of the type hardcover cost more than paperback. What's interesting here is, the average price of an ebook is more than a paperback! What could be the reason? Maybe ebooks have clear formatting of code or many well-known authors in the field of computer science prefer writing ebooks? There can be various reasons. But, our main question is still unanswered, what really impacts the price of a book. Let's look at the correlation matrix for this dataset to find out!","55022c17":"# How does the description of a book differ in terms of rating?\nTo check how does the description of a book differ in terms of rating, we can create wordclouds. First, let us check the distribution of ratings using a histogram and hope that its not skewed!","74698281":"This is interesting, there are a few outliers here and it seems as if there is only one book of the type \"Boxed Set - Hardcover\". Let us confirm this by checking value counts for each type of book.","9a1d94ca":"Now, we are ready to create wordclouds!","d8a77bd1":"# Does book type affect its rating?\nThe first question we would want to look at is, whether the type of book (eg: paperback or ebook) would affect its rating or not. First, we will check whether there are any outliers or not with respect to ratings of different types of books and then we will compare on the basis of average rating for each type of book.","3935aab0":"Looking at the differences, it looks like higher rated books have the words *algorithms, language and code* in their description. That is the key differentiator. But, the two interesting words here are algorithms and language, maybe due to the rise of the tech companies and more and more people wanting to crack interviews, there is a possibilty that the top computer science and programming books focus on algorithms and language. One more thing you can observe is the word python in the higher rated books wordcloud (see bottom-right corner). This is also due to the fact that Python is a very easy language to learn and its becoming very famous due to the rise of artificial intelligence.","54d93903":"This confirms our observation that there is only one book of the type Boxed Set - Hardcover and the dataset seems to have a large number of paperback books. Maybe students studying computer science and programming prefer reading books of the type paperback over ebooks or its just a bias that happened during data collection. Let us look at the average rating for each book type to find out more!","2cfc9196":"# Conclusion\nHere we are, at the end of a journey through numbers (don't forget text!). Some actionable insights which could make a good computer science and programming book are -\n1. Paperback or ebook could be the best book type when we look at price and ratings.\n2. It is very important to find the right balance between price and number of pages as they are positively correlated.\n3. Having the right words in your book description is also a key factor in deciding a good computer science book\n\nIf it does not work out, just write a book on *Python* having *less than or equal to 200 pages*!\n\nThose of you who reached here, thank you so much for reading this kernel, it means a lot! I hope you guys enjoyed.","04f466ca":"This shows another story, even though the number of paperback books exceed the number of ebooks, ebooks have a higher average rating than paperbacks. This could be due to an outlier in the rating of ebooks (check box-plot). Since, there is only one book of the type Boxed Set - Hardcover, we can't really comment whether that is the best choice for a publisher to go for, when he\/she is choosing a type for their computer science and programming book.","1428a33c":"This information tells us that there are no null values in the dataset. But, we need to solve one problem, the Reviews column should not be of the type object as they are integers. First, we need to remove the \",\" from the numbers and then convert them into integers.","0e799aff":"# Description vs. number of pages\nDo you think that the number of pages in a book would affect its description? What are the most common words used in a book's description which has less than 200 pages? Let's find out by making a wordcloud!","1dc86cbd":"There is a clear linear relationship between price and the number of pages! Hence, we can conclude that number of pages does impact price.","5bfb5482":"# Introduction\nThere are many ways to learn computer science, you can either learn by looking at videos or by reading books (some prefer both). But, how do we know if the study material is good, can data science help us in analyzing whether a book is really good or no. In this notebook, we'll look at the top 270 computer science and programming books to find out what makes a good computer science and programming book.","0648a3ad":"Yes! Normal distribution (not exactly, but works!). By looking at the histogram, we can divide the books into two categories, high_rating category would be books having a rating > 4.3 and low_rating category with a rating < 3.85. This would lead to ~50 books in each category. Before we do this, we need to clean the text."}}
