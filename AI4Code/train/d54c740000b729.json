We also used the ReLU activation function to introduce non-linearity into the model, allowing it to learn more complex relationships between the inputs (pixel densities) and outputs (class probabilities).\\\n* We defined some utilities like get_default_device, to_device and DeviceDataLoader to leverage a GPU if available, by moving the input data and model parameters to the appropriate device.\n* We were able to use the exact same training loop: the fit function we had define earlier to train out model and evaluate it using the validation dataset.\n\nThere's a lot of scope to experiment here, and I encourage you to use the interactive nature of Jupyter to play around with the various parameters. Here are a few ideas:\n\n* Try changing the size of the hidden layer, or add more hidden layers and see if you can achieve a higher accuracy.\n* Try changing the batch size and learning rate to see if you can achieve the same accuracy in fewer epochs.\n* Compare the training times on a CPU vs. GPU. Do you see a significant difference. How does it vary with the size of the dataset and the size of the model (no. of weights and parameters)?\n* Try building a model for a different dataset, such as the [CIFAR10 or CIFAR100 datasets](https:\/\/www.cs.toronto.edu\/~kriz\/cifar.html).\n\nHere are some references for further reading:\n\n[A visual proof that neural networks can compute any function](http:\/\/neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com\/chap4.html), also known as the Universal Approximation Theorem.\n\n[But what is a neural network?](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=aircAruvnKk) - A visual and intuitive introduction to what neural networks are and what the intermediate layers represent\n\n[Stanford CS229 Lecture notes on Backpropagation](http:\/\/cs229.stanford.edu\/notes\/cs229-notes-backprop.pdf) - for a more mathematical treatment of how gradients are calculated and weights are updated for neural networks with multiple layers.","91b0f2e1":"Let's define a helper function to ensure that our code uses the GPU if available, and defaults to using the CPU if it isn't.","592071da":"# Model\n\nTo improve upon logistic regression, we'll create a neural network with one hidden layer. Here's what this means:\n\n* Instead of using a single nn.Linear object to transform a batch of inputs (pixel intensities) into a batch of outputs (class probabilities), we'll use two nn.Linear objects. Each of these is called a layer in the network.\n* The first layer (also known as the hidden layer) will transform the input matrix of shape batch_size x 784 into an intermediate output matrix of shape batch_size x hidden_size, where hidden_size is a preconfigured parameter (e.g. 32 or 64).\n* The intermediate outputs are then passed into a non-linear activation function, which operates on individual elements of the output matrix.\n* The result of the activation function, which is also of size batch_size x hidden_size, is passed into the second layer (also knowns as the output layer), which transforms it into a matrix of size batch_size x 10, identical to the output of the logistic regression model.\n\nIntroducing a hidden layer and an activation function allows the model to learn more complex, multi-layered and non-linear relationships between the inputs and the targets. Here's what it looks like visually:\n\n![vDOGEkG.png](attachment:vDOGEkG.png)\n\nThe activation function we'll use here is called a **Rectified Linear Unit** or **ReLU**, and it has a really simple formula: relu(x) = max(0,x) i.e. if an element is negative, we replace it by 0, otherwise we leave it unchanged.\n\nTo define the model, we extend the nn.Module class, just as we did with logistic regression.","3ce89f32":"Tensors that have been moved to the GPU's RAM have a device property which includes the word cuda.

You can use GPUs for free on **Kaggle** kernels or **Google Colab**, or rent GPU-powered machines on services like **Google Cloud Platform**, **Amazon Web Services** or **Paperspace**.\n\nWe can check if a GPU is available and the required NVIDIA CUDA drivers are installed using torch.cuda.is_available.","f9565305":"Next, let's define a function that can move data and model to a chosen device.","d57d7b93":"# Preparing the Data\n\nThe data preparation is identical to the previous tutorial.
