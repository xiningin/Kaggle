We can refer to these points in the chart as peaks and troughs or as local maxima and local minima.\n\n* **Naive method**: A pivot point would require the point preceding and succeeding to be both lower or both higher than a current point.\n\n* **Numerical Differentiation method**: A far more elegant approach is to use the numerical derivative of the closing price to identify the points. The first derivative is the rate of change or effectively the momentum or **velocity** of the closing price, while the second derivative indicates the rate of change of the first derivative or its **acceleration**. \n\n## Trend Line \n\nA trend line is a bounding line for the price movement of a security. It is formed when a diagonal line can be drawn between a minimum of three price pivot points.\n\nAfter computing all pivot points. A minimum of 3 points could be selected in `n(n-1)(n-2)` ways and such enumeration is of algorithmic complexity O(n\u00b3). These points will not always be on a straight line so there will also be some degree of error. The degree of error will be important since we need to filter out incorrect point sets and include ones that are correct.\n\nGiven 3 points, a best fit line can be found which is exactly what a linear regression computes. It finds a line which best fits the 3 or more points based on minimizing the error. The error is typically the sum of squared residuals where the residuals are equivalent to the distance measure as given above.","51df49ff":"# Identify support and resistance trend lines\n> In stock market technical analysis, support and resistance are certain predetermined levels of the price of a security at which it is thought that the price will tend to stop and reverse. These levels are denoted by multiple touches of price without a breakthrough of the level. The higher the timeframe, the more relevant the levels become.\n\nAn area of **support** is where the price of an asset tends to stop falling, and an area of **resistance** is where the price tends to stop rising.
