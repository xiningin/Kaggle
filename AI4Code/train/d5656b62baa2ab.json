In terms of the model's performance relative to others on Kaggle, it features in\/around the <b>top 8%<\/b> on the Leaderboard, which i'm really pleased with. There are more ways in which the model could be improved even further, perhaps i'll come back to these in the future.\n\nIn the meantime, I hope you've enjoyed the read and found the contents helpful. Share an upvote or comment if it did help you, it's always nice to hear. And of course for any questions or suggested improvements, i'm more than happy to hear about these too, so please fire away if you have them! Thanks again for reading and happy Kaggling.","b51e4e90":"## 4. Submission and conclusion\nLet's bundle the newly generated prediction into a submission file for Kaggle.","21fa57f8":"Last up, because the problem is multi-class classification, the network will end according to the number of outcome possibilities (in this case, a Dense layer of size 10), followed by a sigmoid activation, which is the most appropriate for multi-class classification problems.","5219f17f":"With the model set-up, there's just one more step to add before all of the individual elements can be compiled, and that's to add the Optimizer. The model's optimizer uses the Backpropagation algorithm (which is probably the single most important algorithm within Deep Learning) is to use the model's score at each iteration to adjust the weights in a direction that improves the model's ability to predict the outcome. So, the Optimizer is pretty important. There are different optimizers to choose from - I am using RMSprop which is a pretty common choice for classification problems. ","a0f20917":"### Data Augmentation\nAt the current stage the model could be ready for fitting and prediction, however there is one more crucial trick that can be deployed, one that usually yields big gains in model performance: Data Augmentation. This is another technique introduced to combat the ever-present challenge of overfitting, and it comes from the angle that overfitting occurs because of a lack of data to learn from. Thus, augmenting data is the process of randomly generating new training data from the existing samples and transforming in ways that yield different, yet still believable observations. This means when the model is trained, it won't be presented with the same image twice despite copies of the original data being included. The model can then learn about more aspects of the data and ultimately generalise better.\n\nThe below code is the data augmentation set-up, with the desired transformations specified as parameters (e.g. rotation range=10 means a 10 degree rotation at the most will be deployed). Lastly, the augmented data is fit to the training data.**","5f72703c":"![Image of ML Workflow](https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/2000\/1*cuTSPlTq0a_327iTPJyD-Q.png)","0db94229":"Next up, the first convolutional layer is added. To explain each part:\n- Filters: How many observations to make on each digit\n- Kernel_size: How large each filter should (5 by 5 or 3 by 3 are pretty standard sizes)\n- Padding: To account for border effects in a given image. 'Same' means the input image ought to have zero padding so that the output in convolution doesnt differ in size\n- Activation: The activation function for this network, set to 'relu' which is a common choice for such networks\n- Input_shape: Shape of the input, which is already known. This only needs to be specified in the first layer.","1fe8590c":"### Model fit & prediction\nThe model is ready, so let's get training. The model will be fit using the 'fit_generator' function since it will include additional augmented data. I'll start with a batch size of 86 (feel free to choose another). I'd also like the model to run over 100 epochs (or iterations), although it is quite likely to converge before this limit. ","a7f0bf77":"### Splitting data\nAs familiar with Machine Learning, data is split into separate sets prior to modelling. When building networks it's usually most helping to create 3 data sets: Training, Validation & Test. The test set will be completely held back until the final prediction is made. Data will be fit to the training data as usual, and then continually monitored through the validation set, which can be useful in helping to detect and mitigate issues with overfitting as the model grows deeper and more complex. Without a validation set it can be very easy to compile a model that fails to generalise well to new, unseen data.\n","397ef296":"## 2. Data preparation\nWhen using traditional Machine learning techniques, most of the features need to be identified by an domain expert in order to reduce the complexity of the data and make patterns more visible to learning algorithms to work. This is commonly known as the feature engineering step.\n\nThe biggest advantage of Deep Learning algorithms is that they will attempt to learn high-level features from data in an incremental manner. This eliminates the need of domain expertise and hard core feature extraction, which for the researcher can equate to a huge time-saving! The below image illustrates this:","583e13a9":"Before taking on full data preparation steps, the X_train & y_train variables can firstly be set up. Let's also take a sneak peak of labels in the y_train file. ","b7fadf58":"A second Max Pooling & Dropout layer will now be added.","d0caf03d":"### Reshape\nThe MNIST digits dataset with structure (nb_samples, 28, 28) i.e. with 2 dimensions per example representing a greyscale image 28x28.\n\nThe Convolution2D layers in Keras however, are designed to work with 3 dimensions per example. They have 4-dimensional inputs and outputs. This covers colour images (nb_samples, nb_channels, width, height), but more importantly, it covers deeper layers of the network, where each example has become a set of feature maps i.e. (nb_samples, nb_features, width, height).\n\nThe greyscale image for MNIST digits input would either need a different CNN layer design (or a param to the layer constructor to accept a different shape), or the design could simply use a standard CNN and you must explicitly express the examples as 1-channel images. The Keras team chose the latter approach, which needs the re-shape.","70c6dd5d":"When working on Computer Vision, Convolutional Neural Networks are widely regarded as a top performing network. Reference to the above image, this could be a Deep Convolutional Network. \n\nThe fundamental difference between a more standard densely connected layer and a convolution layer is this: Dense layers learn global patterns in their input feature space (for example, for a MNIST digit, patterns involving all pixels), whereas convolution layers learn local patterns: in the case of images, patterns found in small 2D windows of the inputs. \n\nThis key characteristic gives convnets two interesting properties:\n1. <b>The patterns they learn are translation invariant:<\/b> After learning a certain pattern in the lower-right corner of a picture, a convolutional network can recognize it anywhere: for example, in the upper-left corner. A densely connected network would have to learn the pattern anew if it appeared at a new location. This makes convolutional networks data efficient when processing images (because the visual world is fundamentally translation invariant): they need fewer training samples to learn representations that have generalization power.\n2. <b>They can learn spatial hierarchies of patterns:<\/b> A first convolution layer will learn small local patterns such as edges, a second convolution layer will learn larger patterns made of the features of the first layers, and so on. This allows the network to efficiently learn increasingly complex and abstract visual concepts (because the visual world is fundamentally spatially hierarchical).\n\nI won't spend any more time dicsussing the model architecture here, however if you are interested in learning more, find below a few articles that really helped to cement my understanding of how Convolutional Networks specifically help to solve Computer Vision problems:\n1. https:\/\/medium.com\/technologymadeeasy\/the-best-explanation-of-convolutional-neural-networks-on-the-internet-fbb8b1ad5df8\n2. https:\/\/medium.freecodecamp.org\/an-intuitive-guide-to-convolutional-neural-networks-260c2de0a050\n3. https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/components-of-convolutional-neural-networks-6ff66296b456","3ade954d":"The next step is to feed the last output tensor (of shape (3, 3, 64)) into a densely connected classifier network: a stack of Dense layers. These classifiers process vectors, which are 1D, whereas the current output is a 3D tensor. Therefore we have to flatten the 3D outputs to 1D, and then add a Dense layer on top. It's not uncommon to add multiple dense layers at this stage - for now I'm sticking with one.","11097795":"There are however still some (relatively simple) preparation steps to consider - let's walk through these one by one next.","38ea7ee6":"### Normalisation\nAnother standard preparation step is to normalise data, this means dividing by the pixel range (in this case 255) so that all data becomes scaled between 0-1. The risk of not normalising data fed into a neural network is that large gradient updates become more likely, and these will typically prevent the network from later converging. Thus, it's best practice to convert data where needed to take on small values, like 0-1, and ensuring all data is homogenous in range (e.g. roughly the same scale is being used).","1924acc7":"### Define model architecture\nI'll now walk through my final chosen Convolutional Neural Network step by step.\n\nA common framework for CNN's is as follows:\n<b>Conv -> Conv -> Pool -> Conv -> Pool -> FC -> FC -> FC -> Softmax<\/b>\n\nI aim to follow this guideline as much as possible, with a bit of flexing which basically results from trial and error.\n\nThe very first step prior to defining a convolutional layer is to define a sequential model in Keras. Sequential, because we'll be adding layers one at a time.","c9f56a24":"Some other result metrics will help to determine the model's accuracy and most importantly, the ability it has to generalise to new data. Below is code to produce a confusion for the model's ability to accurately predict each outcome, followed by plots for accuracy and loss to determine the model's performance at every epoch, and to also check for any signs of overfitting.","feda6687":"## 3. Modelling\nIn relatively few steps the data is set up and it's now time to build a network to predict the target (number classification). Neural networks come in all shapes and sizes, with different broad families of networks performing better for certain tasks rather than others. To comprehend the scale of recognised networks commonly used to solve complex data problems, see the below image:","542fe7c4":"While the framework outlined previously did not include a 4th convolutional layer, I am adding one here as a result of trial and error with the current data set. Simply put, my model performed better with this 4th layer. It seems there is still more to learn at this stage!","d9869709":"Let's add in the second convolutional layer, same as before.","9c126f3f":"### Callbacks\nThis is the final step to implement before model fitting. A callback is a method of stopping or altering model training when the validation loss stops improving. Callbacks are handy because they are operations deployed during the model training process, taking actions that could not be predicted prior to the model training process. Examples of callbacks include interrupting training, saving a model or loading a different weight set.\n\nThis callback is a simple to alter the model's learning rate when the validation loss has stopped improving. It's an effective method for helping a model to escape a 'local minimum' when training, thus supporting the goal of reaching the global minimum. For more info on this, read up about the gradient descent process. \n\nBelow I will initiate the ReduceLROnPlateau function and define some key parameters. Other Kaggle kernel's helped me to arrive at the specific parameter weights in this instance.","cf540b22":"Next up I will add in a Max Pooling layer (the first of two).

The premise of Dropout layers is: <b>'Learning less to learn better'<\/b>.

It works in a similar fashion to Regularisation within Machine Learning, such that it seeks to reduce interdependent learning amongst neurons within the network. Dropout therefore forces a neural network to learn more robust features that are useful in conjunction with many different random subsets of the other neurons.","4331ae35":"A third convolutional layer will now be added, this time with a larger filter size combined with smaller kernel size.
