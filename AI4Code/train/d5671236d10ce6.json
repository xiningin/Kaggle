","8c46cc1b":"# Novel Corono Virus\n\n**Backstory:** \nThe recent virus belong to a family of virus named 'Corona'. \nIt is called Novel because its new, and no name hasn't been thought of yet. \nThis class of virus usually migrates from animals to humans, thus contagious. \n\n**Symptoms:**\nThe symtoms usually are seasonal flu, which makes it difficult to identify. \n\n**Threats:**\nThe virus spreads really faster, which is good and bad at the same time. \nIf you are confused as I was when I first heard it, keep reading. \nA virus which can spread easily, is much less life threathning. \nThat is why the mortality rate of Corona Virus is around 2% as per scientist across the Globe. \n\n**Verdict:**\nSo, what's the verdict? Well, there is no reason to panic, but its defintely a matter of concern. \nIts because, it will take more than one year to derieve any cure for the virus. \nIn the mean time, it's our immune system that will have to fight. \nSo, stay clean and eat healthy.\n\n\n### The Dataset\nBased on dataset available which contains geographical and medical records, we will learn the impact of Corona Virus through exploratory data analysis with special focus on China. \n\n*Please Note:* I have just started on this notebook.
