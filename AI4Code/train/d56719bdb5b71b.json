As you see it gives us LB 0.395","f7101f0d":"## Summary\nI was confused as to what is it that we are trying to forecast in this competition. Apparently, if you group your test set by `installation_id` you will get a long list of the activities of a user. It contains games, clips, activities, Assessments, etc. We should use this history to predict the very last row of each `installation_id`. Below is an example for the first user in test set `00abaee7`. This data shows, he\/she started the app, watched the welcome to app clip, then magma peak - level 1 clip and then two other clips. Then he\/she played the \"Chow Time\" game. As you scroll down you can see all of his\/her acitivies. At the very end of the activities list you can see that he\/she started to play \"Cauldron Filler\" Assessment task which only has 1 row. The test set is truncated there to indicate that we should predict this user's Assessment on this task.","1082510c":"Hope this gets you started. Kudos to yasufuminakama for clarifying it for me. \n\nHappy kaggling!"}}
