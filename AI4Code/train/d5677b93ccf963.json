Ever since then, prices have been growing at a relatively steady rate. In 2020 however, many experts are projecting an unusual fluctuating gold prices due to the unprecedented corona-virus outbreak which had a great impact on our economy.\n\nhypothesis\n\nFall: In a simplified approach to understand the potential correlation between the increased numbers of covid-19 cases in the US and the price of gold, we will start off by taking a closer look at the drop of gold prices at the beginning stages of US covid-19 outbreak back in march. This was during the increased markets\u2019 volatility driven by the fears. Nobody knew what was happening next and people mostly grabbed on their good old US dollar.\n\nRise: During this time of record low since Dec 2019, an opportunity may have opened up for short term gold investors which led to a reasonable recovery. Now, why did the price keep on rising ? Is it safe to say that the trillions of dollars that were dumped into the economy in early April held a big welcome sign for inflation. Did this raise concerns about the value of the dollar and caused the prices of gold to shoot back up?\n\nData\n\n- https:\/\/www.usagold.com\/reference\/prices\/goldhistory.php\n\n- https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/owid\/covid-19-data\/master\/public\/data\/owid-covid-data.csv\n\nResources \n\n- https:\/\/www.fxempire.com\/forecasts\/article\/price-of-gold-fundamental-daily-forecast-rise-in-covid-19-cases-has-investors-betting-on-more-stimulus-657804\n\n- https:\/\/www.macrotrends.net\/1333\/historical-gold-prices-100-year-chart","01ae0008":"# # US covid-19 outbreak effect on gold prices\n\n"}}
