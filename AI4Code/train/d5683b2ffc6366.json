By this we can imagine residential construction in the area will be heavily affected by Rodent issues resulting in a lot of money spent on Exterminators with a possibility of diseases.","e56be941":"While starting off with the Exploratory analysis of NY building permit dait was an interesting situation to what other dataset could better contextualize the findings from the preliminary dataset. There were many ideas that floated in my head like analyzing building permits from other cities, or map the location of construction to Traffic adccidents, crime data but further into the analysis, we come to fact that majority of the permits are for residential construction and Rodent problem is very common in New York City."}}
