In this article we have loaded it in a dataframe named \u2018df\u2019 so we will set is as \u2018df\u2019.\n\n2) target: It contains the name of the target variable. In our case, the target variable name is \u201cTenYearCHD\u201d.\n\n3) test: It contains the test dataset. We can also leave it blank like this \u201c\u201d if we do not have any test dataset so that it will split the train dataset int train and test.\n\n4) sample_submission: We will leave it empty so that it will automatically create submission in our local directory.\n\n5) hyper_param: We will randomized search cv because it is 3X faster than Grid Search CV. We need to set this as \u201cRS\u201d.\n\n6) feature_reduction: We will set this as true so that it will take into consideration the most important predictor variable for model creation.\n\n7) scoring_parameter: You can give your own parameter for scoring or otherwise it will assume appropriate according to the model. We will use \u201cWeighted-f1\u201d here.\n\n8) KMeans_featurizer: This should be true for linear and False for XGboost or random classifier because it can lead to overfitting.\n\n9) boosting_flag: Used for boosting. Here we will keep it as False.\n\n10) binning_flag: By default, it is False and can be set to True when we want to convert the top numeric variables into binned variables.\n\n11) add_poly: We will set it as false.\n\n12) stacking_flag: By default it is False. If set to True, it will add an additional feature which is derived from predictions of another model. We will keep it as False.\n\n13) Imbalanced_flag: It will check data imbalance if set to TRUE and will remove data imbalance using SMOTING technique.\n\n14) Verbose: Generally used to print the steps that are performed. We will set it as 3."}}
