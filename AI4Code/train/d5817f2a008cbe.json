In contrast to traditional supervised machine learning algorithms, K-Means attempts to classify data without having first been trained with labeled data. Once the algorithm has been run and the groups are defined, any new data can be easily assigned to the most relevant group.\n\nFor this project we will attempt to use KMeans Clustering to cluster Universities into to two groups, Private and Public.\n\n___\nIt is **very important to note, we actually have the labels for this data set, but we will NOT use them for the KMeans clustering algorithm, since that is an unsupervised learning algorithm.** \n\nWhen using the Kmeans algorithm under normal circumstances, it is because you don't have labels. In this case we will use the labels to try to get an idea of how well the algorithm performed, but you won't usually do this for Kmeans, so the classification report and confusion matrix at the end of this project, don't truly make sense in a real world setting!.\n___\n## Types Clustering:\n![clustering.jfif](attachment:clustering.jfif)\n### Connectivity-based clustering\n* Distance based\n* E.g., Hierarchical clustering\n\n\n### Centroid-based clustering\n* Represents each cluster by a single mean vector\n* E.g., k-means algoritm\n\n\n### Distribution-based clustering\n* Modeled using statistical distributions\n* E.g., Multivariate normal distributions used by the expectation-maximization algorithm.\n\n\n### Density-based clustering\n* Defines clusters as connected dense regions in the data space.\n* E.g., DBSCAN","41b07c82":"**Notice how there seems to be a private school with a graduation rate of higher than 100%.What is the name of that school?**","a05a9a5b":"**Fit the model to all the data except for the Private label.**","dddd4e11":"**Create a similar histogram for the Grad.Rate column.**","f11570d5":"# 2.
