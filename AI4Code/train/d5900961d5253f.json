This happens because coronary arteries that supply the heart muscle with blood flow can become narrowed from a buildup of fat, cholesterol and other substances that together are called plaque. \n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.heart.org\/en\/health-topics\/heart-attack\/about-heart-attacks\">Link for more information<\/a>\n\n#### Breakdown of data analysis\n##### - Import libraries and dataset\n##### - Using packages such as seaborn and matplotlib to show data analysis and describe\n##### - Quick findings","d5b11f15":"#### Findings from data analysis\n\n##### - Men are more likely to have heart attacks than women\n##### - You are more likely to have a heart attack between 40-60\n##### - The higher the cholesterol level the higher the chance of a heart attack\n##### - Chest pain is less than 3 during a heart attack\n##### - Resting blood pressure averages between 120 - 140\n##### - The older you are, the lower the maximum heart rate"}}
