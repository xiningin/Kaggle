You'll use the Pandas library for this.  Pandas is the primary tool data scientists use for exploring and manipulating data.  Most people abbreviate pandas in their code as `pd`.  We do this with the command","bf48fd6b":"# Interpreting Data Description\nThe results show 8 numbers for each column in your original dataset. The first number, the **count**,  shows how many rows have non-missing values.  \n\nMissing values arise for many reasons. For example, the size of the 2nd bedroom wouldn't be collected when surveying a 1 bedroom house. We'll come back to the topic of missing data.\n\nThe second value is the **mean**, which is the average.  Under that, **std** is the standard deviation, which measures how numerically spread out the values are.\n\nTo interpret the **min**, **25%**, **50%**, **75%** and **max** values, imagine sorting each column from lowest to highest value.  The first (smallest) value is the min.  If you go a quarter way through the list, you'll find a number that is bigger than 25% of the values and smaller than 75% of the values.  That is the **25%** value (pronounced \"25th percentile\").  The 50th and 75th percentiles are defined analogously, and the **max** is the largest number.\n\n\n# Your Turn\nGet started with your **[first coding exercise](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/kernels\/fork\/1258954)**","ce87abf2":"---\n\n\n\n\n*Have questions or comments?

A DataFrame holds the type of data you might think of as a table. This is similar to a sheet in Excel, or a table in a SQL database. \n\nPandas has powerful methods for most things you'll want to do with this type of data.  \n\nAs an example, we'll look at [data about home prices](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/dansbecker\/melbourne-housing-snapshot) in Melbourne, Australia. In the hands-on exercises, you will apply the same processes to a new dataset, which has home prices in Iowa.\n\nThe example (Melbourne) data is at the file path **`..\/input\/melbourne-housing-snapshot\/melb_data.csv`**.\n\nWe load and explore the data with the following commands:"}}
