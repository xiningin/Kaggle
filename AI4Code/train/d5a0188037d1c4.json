A typical example is when an investor facing retirement from service,  chooses to invest her hard-earned retirement benefits  in bank deposits or government bonds which are risk free (and therefore yield low returns), rather than investing them in stock markets which despite their  potential to yield massive returns are bound by risks. Again, time plays a significant role while managing the risk - reward interplay of investments. For example,  a long term investment in high yielding stocks in the stock market or real estate, can help appreciation of the investor's capital, while offering the potential to recover from risks.
