At the beginning, the whole training set is considered as the root.\n2. Feature values need to be categorical. If the values are continuous then they are discretized prior to building the model.\n3.

In Physics and Mathematics, entropy is referred to as the randomness or uncertainty of a random variable X.

Overfitting in Decision Tree algorithm** <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"6\"><\/a>\n\n[Table of Contents](#0.1)\n\n\nOverfitting is a practical problem while building a Decision-Tree model. The problem of overfitting is considered when the algorithm continues to go deeper and deeper to reduce the training-set error but results with an increased test-set error. So, accuracy of prediction for our model goes down. It generally happens when we build many branches due to outliers and irregularities in data.\n\nTwo approaches which can be used to avoid overfitting are as follows:-\n\n- Pre-Pruning\n\n- Post-Pruning\n\n\n## **Pre-Pruning**\n\nIn pre-pruning, we stop the tree construction a bit early. We prefer not to split a node if its goodness measure is below a threshold value. But it is difficult to choose an appropriate stopping point.\n\n\n## **Post-Pruning**\n\nIn post-pruning, we go deeper and deeper in the tree to build a complete tree. If the tree shows the overfitting problem then pruning is done as a post-pruning step. We use the cross-validation data to check the effect of our pruning. Using cross-validation data, we test whether expanding a node will result in improve or not. If it shows an improvement, then we can continue by expanding that node. But if it shows a reduction in accuracy then it should not be expanded. So, the node should be converted to a leaf node.","894962b3":"[Go to Top](#0)","3d3d7e58":"<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"0\"><\/a>\n# **Decision Tree Classifier Tutorial with Python**\n\n\nHello friends,\n\nIn this kernel, I build a Decision Tree Classifier to predict the safety of the car.

Feature Engineering** <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"12\"><\/a>\n\n[Table of Contents](#0.1)\n\n\n**Feature Engineering** is the process of transforming raw data into useful features that help us to understand our model better and increase its predictive power. I will carry out feature engineering on different types of variables.\n\n\nFirst, I will check the data types of variables again.","95ab5092":"# **10.

Attribute selection measures** <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"5\"><\/a>\n\n[Table of Contents](#0.1)\n\n\nThe primary challenge in the Decision Tree implementation is to identify the attributes which we consider as the root node and each level. This process is known as the **attributes selection**. There are different attributes selection measure to identify the attribute which can be considered as the root node at each level.\n\n\nThere are 2 popular attribute selection measures. They are as follows:-\n\n\n- **Information gain**\n\n- **Gini index**\n\n\nWhile using **Information gain** as a criterion, we assume attributes to be categorical and for **Gini index** attributes are assumed to be continuous. These attribute selection measures are described below.\n","6d1b8e58":"### Compare the train-set and test-set accuracy\n\n\nNow, I will compare the train-set and test-set accuracy to check for overfitting.","eaf83609":"### Visualize decision-trees with graphviz","8b779621":"### Frequency distribution of values in variables\n\nNow, I will check the frequency counts of categorical variables.","162ff212":"The ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser) Decision Tree algorithm uses entropy to calculate information gain. So, by calculating decrease in **entropy measure** of each attribute we can calculate their information gain. The attribute with the highest information gain is chosen as the splitting attribute at the node.","7ada48a7":"### Visualize decision-trees","625b725d":"### Rename column names\n\nWe can see that the dataset does not have proper column names. The columns are merely labelled as 0,1,2.... and so on. We should give proper names to the columns. I will do it as follows:-","e3626fa3":"# **2. Classification and Regression Trees (CART)** <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"2\"><\/a>\n\n[Table of Contents](#0.1)\n\n\nNowadays, Decision Tree algorithm is known by its modern name **CART** which stands for **Classification and Regression Trees**. Classification and Regression Trees or **CART** is a term introduced by Leo Breiman to refer to Decision Tree algorithms that can be used for classification and regression modeling problems.\n\n\nThe CART algorithm provides a foundation for other important algorithms like bagged decision trees, random forest and boosted decision trees. In this kernel, I will solve a classification problem. So, I will refer the algorithm also as Decision Tree Classification problem. \n","fce2b59f":"### Check accuracy score with criterion entropy"}}
