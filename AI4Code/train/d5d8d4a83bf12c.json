With a R-Squared of .77","f8470be1":"Our linear regression model predicts that in 20 days we'll have almost **1.8 million people infected**. This is obviously a very simple linear regression model using some very basic data. We could surely do a much better job using other features like, total population, infection probability etc. The model also doesn't take into consideration the measures taken by governments to reduce the spread of the infection and obviously it also doesn't take into account the development of medicine and vaccination.\n\n# WIP\n\n### TODO\n\n- Add more features (external) to the dataset;\n- Make prediction on fatalities;\n- Draw insights from features correlation with the spread of the disease;\n- Sugestions?\n\nThanks for reading! Upvote if you enjoyed >.<","830e55ee":"### Does the Line Fit?\n\nJust as a baseline, let's see how well we can fit a basic linear regression to the data.","ce39de9b":"From the chart above, we can clearly see the exponential trend of the disease, and we can also see that the spread seemed to be slowing down a big at the beginning of march, until it began accelerating again, as can be seen in the semi-logarithmic chart on the right.\n\n### True Exponentials Don't Exist.\n\nIn the real world, true exponentials don't exist. They are all pretty much the beggining of a logistic curve. The imporant thing when trying to understand the development of the disease is to understand if we are past or behind the inflection point.\n\nThe inflection point is the point right in the middle of the logistic curve, where the disease will start slowing down until it reaches full stop.\n\n<br>\n![image](https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/236908607\/figure\/fig1\/AS:601626985381906@1520450459171\/Graph-of-logistic-curve-where-a-0-and-b-1.png)\n<br>\n### Growth Factor\n\nThe growth factor is the ratio between the number of cases one day and the number of cases in the previous day. It shows us if the disease is growing or not. Basically a growth factor of 1 tells us that the number of cases isn't growing, smaller than one means it's decreasing and bigger than one means it's increasing. At the inflection point, the growth factor is equal to 1.","19da17fb":"# Covid-19 - Analysis and Modelling\n\nBefore anything. I'd like to disclose that I'm nowhere near close to an epidemiologist. But I do however enjoy math, statistics, machine learning etc. On my daily job I lead the fraud prevention intelligence team at a big fintech company. With that said, most of the studies, commentaries and conclusions in this work are the results of my professional experience with data modelling and some very shallow research, but most come from basic math and stats knowledge.\n\nIt worries me deeply that this kind of event happens in such a bad timing for humanity. We are living in the age of disinformation, which is likely one of the most hurting aspects in this entire crisis. I'm hopeful that this kind of open studies we do at Kaggle can help bring some knowledge and sense into the scene and we can either take the issue more seriously or be less anxious about it, whichever is needed at the time.\n\nI'm thankful for beeing in a position where I'm able to contribute and I trully believe we can always make better decisions when we have data on our side. This is my attempt on helping somehow.\n\n### Epidemics and Exponentials\n\nUntil now we can see that the spread of the disease has been following an exponential like curve, which is very common for epidemics. Some peculiarities occur, like for example, China changing protocols for counting covid-19 cases, so there is a little bit of deviation but the pattern persists."}}
