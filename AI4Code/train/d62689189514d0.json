But nevertheless their final estimates are quite high. \nI hope that they think not only about their success in school but also about health! \nAlso, students with very good health have high final grades.  Now look at the absenteeism.","64b01d3e":"Most students spend 2 to 5  and 5 to 10 hours a week studying.   It would be better if we had the exact number of hours for each student. Personally, I think a student who spends 5 hours a week studying is a diligent student. 2 hours is not always enough.\nBut we can pay attention to the impact of the number of hours spent on study on the final grade of the student.","db42b815":"**Brrrr**","22fe275f":"Um. Most students prefer to spend a week sober or almost without alcohol. But still there is someone who likes to drink on a weekday. Let's see if that affects student grades and absences.","49b72ccc":"We also have information about the student's desire to get higher education in the future. This is useful information! Does the desire to get higher education influence the final grades?","8856c50d":"Well... Who studied well the first two periods, he got a good grade! lol This is indicated by the correlation coefficient.\nBut above we have considered almost all the features and can draw other conclusions.\n\nIs there a secret of excellent grades? Certainly. And as we have seen it is to give enough time to study, not to miss classes, remember that you can not give 100% of the time to the beloved and so on.\nAnd of course not to abuse alcohol on weekdays. What about the weekend? Science gives us the right to relax on weekends!\n","f54977bc":"Of course here I wanted to see a completely cyan circle! Just for curious I want to separately look at the situation in families where parents live together.","e991e57d":"Now consider one very important thing. Students health! In our sample of very young teenagers and I hope that they all have excellent health.","3c1cc98e":"Oh. To be honest, I'm very upset.I would like to see a completely green circle.  Be healthy friends! \nLet's see if the health of the student affects  final grades and the number of passes.","1ec92f59":"I'm shocked. They spend less time! Are these students geniuses or lazy?","595f5eb1":"Most mothers are housewives. And it was very surprising how many mothers work in medicine.  Let's see about the fathers.","92fa69a3":"The lowest average result is shown by students who spend less than two hours a week studying.   Of course! I am a student and I can say that this time is not enough. Especially when it comes to mathematics.  Few students spend more than 10 hours a week studying. But they show a very good result. \nSometimes we're all lazy. But we must try to find time to study and good grades will become stable.\nWe have information about the student's place of residence: city or village.  Let's see. This may be useful to us in the future. Perhaps students living in the city are much more likely to attend parties with alcohol or are busy with more interesting things than studying. Or students living in villages may be too lazy to get to school and miss classes. Also display the time that students spend on the way to school ( 1 - very close, 4 - very far).","5297dc8d":"And the last thing we'll look at is the student's family. The family plays a very important role in the development of the child. The data set gives us a lot of information about the student's family, profession and education of parents and so on. We can't just walk away!\nLet's start with the fact that we look at the number of people in the families of the student and the status of residence of parents: father and mother live together or not.","bbb3a12f":"The number of girls is a little more. We will come back to the gender of students when we consider the final grades of students and so on.  \nNow let's pay attention to the age of students. After all, we assume, for example, that the younger the student the less likely that he uses alcohol.","9f25a091":"We have data on the amount of alcohol consumed by students on weekdays(\"Dalc\") and weekends(\"Walc\"). The main thing we are interested in is whether the amount of alcohol consumed affects success in school. Let's see! \nLet's start with alcohol consumption on weekdays.","47566688":"How many teachers!","8e780f40":"Yeahh. A happy family is a complete family! Love is happiness and so on :)","6bf099e3":"Then let's see how many hours a week students spend on their studies.","1cb39561":"Drinking alcohol on weekdays is a bad idea! :D\nOf course, the number of those who love to drink on weekdays is much less than the number of those who prefer to spend weekdays sober.  But we can see that the final grades of these students are significantly lower.  Let's look at the situation with the consumption of alcohol on the weekend.\n\n","d283a6ff":"I am happy to see that almost all students want to get higher education. And I hope that the field of mathematics :D","683edb17":"I was very interested in whether it is possible to predict the students ' grades according to the available data. My usual linear regression was 0.79. Maybe you will create a perfect model!\nThank you so much for staying awake while you read my kernel :D","cf59cb1a":"I will look at the correlation between the features I am interested in. You can always look at all the fealures - \"data.corr()\" :D","3812d7bb":"![![image.png](attachment:image.png)](https:\/\/img.buzzfeed.com\/buzzfeed-static\/static\/2015-07\/27\/11\/enhanced\/webdr02\/anigif_enhanced-6721-1438012523-2.gif)"}}
