Its not shiny, its not too much code, its the perfect library for doing anything remotely related to computer vision.\nSecondly, LITTLE CODING required. Its way less than other libraries and even though just like pytorch, FastAI is also quite tweakable its main usefulness lies in the default setting which are optimized for almost anything.","c34dc0ad":"And it did not! Thank you for going through my notebook, I hope you have a wonderful day! :)"}}
