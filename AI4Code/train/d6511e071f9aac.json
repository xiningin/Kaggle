I'm going to consider the F1 score which is a weighted average of the Precision and Recall metric. To refresh\n* **Precision**: Is the measure of how many that were predicted to be a class were actually the class? In this case, I would look at hte precision of the minority class, fradualent transactions and see how many of the fradualent transactions were correctly classified\n* **Recall**: A measure of how many positive values in the original dataset were classified correctly. Another way to describe this is the number of true positives divided by the number of total positives in the original dataset. \n\n$$ F1 Score = 2 * \\frac{precision * recall}{precision + recall}$$\n\nWhile in some use cases, it may make sense to prioritize precision or recall (a treatment cheap so it's better to identify things as positive to be safe instead of focusing on precision). For the case of project, I am focusing on precision and recall."}}
