But I decided for it. Since if someone wants to secretly encode information in data, it will probably always be possible. \n\nShowing how they cheated is very interesting and was educational to me. \n\nDiscussing why it could happen in the first place is even more important.\n\nI know that Kaggle might not be that happy with me publishing this since it makes most of the private test labels public. I apologize in advance, but I think a lot can be learnt from this, and the participants who spent countless hours on the competition also deserve to know what exactly happened.","71989349":"As you've probably read in Andy's [announcement](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/petfinder-adoption-prediction\/discussion\/125436), Team \"Bestpetting\", the prior first team in this competition, has been removed because of cheating.\n\nI've helped PetFinder.my convert the top solutions of their competition to a production system in the past few months and I recently discovered that Bestpetting had been cheating.\n\nI'd like to thank Andy from PetFinder.my for very professionally handling this scenario and for always being very helpful and dependable when working together.","abcd0cbc":"Bestpetting have been using the external dataset [\"Cute Cats and Dogs from Pixabay.com\"](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/ppleskov\/cute-cats-and-dogs-from-pixabaycom\/). This dataset contains a bunch of images and a .csv file containing labels.\n\nThe images don't matter, but the .csv file does.\n\nIt contains an ID hash in which the team encoded the labels of the private test set in.","c3bbcd60":"# The cheating","bd5c2eee":"Interestingly, the kind of manipulation of IDs they did would have been easy to find if you were suspicious of the ID column in the first place. Taking a look at the last digits of the IDs, you can see that they are very unevenly distributed.","ef4e6575":"This only works if a primitive encoding technique is used. With more sophisticated schemes, it will always be possible to encode information in data that is nearly impossible for anybody else to find.","fcf18e8d":"# How they hid it","169d4138":"`proc` then calls `process` with the original data, plus the dictionary from `get_dict`. Then for every tenth pet the prediction is replaced with the value from the hash dictionary if the ID is found there.\n\nIt is probably only replaced for every tenth pet to not make the score too obviously illegitimate.","21a6afbd":"Of course they did not write out the logic of this procedure like I did above. Otherwise it would hopefully not have taken such a long time to find it. In their original submission it was cleverly hidden inside a `majority_voting` function.\n\n`majority_voting` does majority voting and stores the result in the tmp column, but also calls `proc` on the dataframe.","36bbd48c":"Whereas MD5 hashes of random strings are distributed evenly.","59afb136":"`proc` then calls `get_dict` on labels_df. `get_dict` now creates the hash dictionary using the same logic as in my version above.","01836fb5":"This whole incident has been very frustrating to me. Not only because it undermines the legitimacy of Kaggle competitions in general, but also because I wasted quite a lot of time investigating their solution and porting it to production only to find out that it is not legitimate.\n\nIt is still an opportunity to learn though.\nFirstly, it would probably be good to only upload external data that is actually used in your solution. In this case, the entire .csv file could have been omitted because all the information is captured in the file structure anyway. I'm looking forward to discussion on this though, since it is obviously not the root cause of the problem.\n\nSecondly, and most importantly: __Everyone who wins money from a competition should be required to open-source their solution__. I am not the first one to say this and I have no idea why it is still not the case. I understand that competition sponsors should be able to opt-out of this for privacy reasons (but then again, why host a Kaggle competition in the first place if that's the case?), but it should definitely be the default.\n\nI would even go as far as automatically publicizing all submitted solutions after the competition. At least for Kernels competitions this would be easy to implement and it would reduce fraud to essentially zero. Unless I am missing something this should not be a problem.","b59111dc":"If we now take a look at the sets of hashed pet information IDs and IDs from their external dataset, we can see that exactly 3500 of them overlap.","a0f3a91d":"They applied some preprocessing to the name column of the test data and then concatenated many columns (`hash_cols` below) into one string.
