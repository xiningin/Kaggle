I voted to almost all of the genres but most of the actors and directors are without vote. So this list **is more genre based**, for example I like **Keanu Reeves** and I voted to him but there were not any movie of him in this list (maybe because he has not played in my favorite genre ;D ) for solving this problem we can give higher vote to actors (if actors are more important or equal to genre) or normalize the vector of our tastes by these three concepts.","54328818":"\nIn this level of prediction, my program gives recommendations by **Genre , Actors** and **Director** so I got dummies from these tree columns:","92f65a04":"Now I define **another recommendation based on a text analysis** which uses \"[Gestalt Pattern Matching](http:\/\/collaboration.cmc.ec.gc.ca\/science\/rpn\/biblio\/ddj\/Website\/articles\/DDJ\/1988\/8807\/8807c\/8807c.htm).

I kept these parameters in \"sim\" array.\n\nThen I defined another array named \"similar\" which was built by sorting first n indexes of 'sim' array with maximum parameter value.\n","b52fa4aa":"So till now, it is a **complete code** (without making \"testing\" file) which takes data in data frame then drops unnecessary columns then gets dummies from necessary columns and then it makes testing file including all genres, actors and directors for user to vote.
