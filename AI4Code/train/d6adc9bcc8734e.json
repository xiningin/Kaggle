I hope this is interesting for you as it is for me as I am from the UK.\n\nFeel free to fork for your own learning and edit the code or use in your own submissions. If you found this enriched your learning in the slightest please **upvote** this notebook as an encouragement for me to continue writing notebooks! :)\n\nThanks to Andrew Sundberg for uploading this dataset which is very clean and easy to work with.","0014ff16":"<a id=\"conclusion\"><\/a>\n\n# Conclusion\nThere are a lot of interesting column variables to explore and find relationships to success.\n\nWe have explored fields to determine the high level metrics to enable success of a team, i.e. the scatterplot of how to qualify for the NCAA team, which can be drilled down even further and how it changed over the years.\n\nIt's worth exploring how the NCAA tournament works and the rules and how the teams match up against each other to understand more the underlying reason if we want to call finishing well at a NCAA tournament a factor for success or is it have the best win\/game ratio?\n\nFrom being a basketball enthusiast, there a waaay more factors that determine the success for a team, you can see the champion teams, they have lost some games! It can be determine, by the players (note they play college for 1-3 years generally), it can be due to the coaching facility, the head coach, even how adaptable they are towards the game. \n\nThe game of basketball has changed and have a lot more focus and emphasis with shooting the 3-point shot, which is actually driven by data analytics. This is why I find data analytics and data science so interesting because of it's many sources of applications.\n\nThank you all for reading - Richie\n\nI can be connected on LinkedIn.\nhttps:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/richieone\/\n\n### What's Next\nI intend to work on finding out these questions along the dataset.\n\n* Finding the underdog teams, and how they progressed throughout the years.\n* How college basketball how progressed throughout the years. i.e. number of 3 point shots taken, how the average offensive and defensive rating has changed.","eff7f477":"<a id=\"qualify\"><\/a>\n### Number of Teams qualify to March Madness\n\nHow many teams make it to the March Madness?","ddacba12":"### Encoding data\n\nAs it is a categorical data - it's better to encode to integor value to undertake other analysis, this can also be done to the SEED Column.","58b0717e":"Table of Contents\n* [Objectives](#intro)\n    - [Types of Data in Dataset](#typesofdata)\n\n\n* [Exploratory Data Analysis](#exploratorydataanalysis)\n    - [Import Libaries and file](#import)\n    - [First look at 2019 Dataset](#DF2019)\n    - [Number of games played](#gamesplayed)\n    - [Number of Teams in each conferences](#conferences)\n    - [Number of Teams qualify to March Madness](#qualify)\n    - [Heatmap Matrix of the correlations](#correlation)\n    - [Winners of the NCAA Basketball Tournament](#winners)\n    - [Scatterplot for how to qualify to NCAA Tournament](#relationshipqualify)\n    \n        \n        \n* [What's Next](#conclusion)","e0cd7cc9":"<a id=\"winners\"><\/a>\n# Winners of the NCAA Basketball Tournament","4d2e16dc":"From this querying of the table, we can see that AJDE and the Barthag scores are very high in the fields (above 80 and 84%.\n\nADJDE: Adjusted Defensive Efficiency (An estimate of the defensive efficiency (points allowed per 100 possessions) a team would have against the average Division I offense)\n\nBARTHAG: Power Rating (Chance of beating an average Division I team)","e2963bbc":"The scatter plot shows it is important for a team to have high Effective Field Goal Percentage Shot (EFG_O) and low Effective Field Goal Percentage Allowed (EFG_D) in order to have higher chance to qualify from (2015-2019)."}}
