For categorical feature, replacing missing value with mode makes sense because one can't find mean or median or any other statistical measure for it.\n    * Replace the missing values with a new label \"others\" --> This, in my opinion, is the best approach as not only it helps to retain the information but creates a new better variable which might affect the SalePrice as seen in EDA Section.\n* Numerical Features\n    * For discrete features, replacing the missing values with mode is the best option for obvious reasons.\n    * For continuous features\n        * Remove the records containing missing values --> This step must be done very carefully as it might result into loss of important information.\n        * Replace the missing values with mean --> This is one of the most common steps done. However, there is a problem associated with it. Sometimes, the mean is biased in terms of outliers. They greatly influence the mean and hence this might now be a wise choice if we detect the presence of outliers in EDA part.\n        * Replace the missing values with median --> This is the best approach because the median is not affected by outliers. Further, median represents 50th Percentile which means 50% values are above and below that point.\n        * Replace the missing values with mode","21fdf5f6":"# Feature Engineering\n* This is the second step after Exploratory Data Analysis.\n* Check out my notebook on Exploratory Data Analysis for the House Price Prediction competition.\n* Now, let's continue with feature engineering\n\n## Definition\n* It is the process selecting, manipulating and transforming raw data into features that can be used in supervised learning.\n* This also includes adding of some new features (if necessary) derived from combination of two or more features.\n\n## What will we consider in this notebook?\n* Handling Missing Values\n    * Numerical\n    * Categorical\n* Handling Temporal Variable\n* Handling Outliers\n* Removing rare labels\n* Performing Encoding for categorical features.\n* Log transforming (If necessary)\n* Standardizing the values (If necessary).\n* Note that after some tinkering, both these steps are not needed because we might be using Tree based model and they are not affected by the distributions and scaling. \n\n> Since this step will be performed for both trainig as well as test set, it is better to define functions for it.","8ece4eb6":"### Interpretation\n* From the above heatmap, it is clear that there are no missing values remaining in any of the columns.","810b9efa":"# Performing Encoding for Categorical Features\n* Most of the models expect a numerical imput in order to train itself and predict for the test data.\n* Thus, it makes a requirement for converting the categorical feature into Numercial one.\n* One can do this by \"encoding\" categorical features\n* For further reference, read [this article](https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/categorical-feature-encoding-547707acf4e5#:~:text=6.-,Label%20Encoding%20and%20Ordinal%20Encoding,unique%20value%20in%20a%20feature.).\n\n## Types of encoders\n* One-Hot encoding\n    * Created new columns for each class and assigns them either 0 or 1.\n    * Further, it ensures that exactly 1 of the columns have 1 for each observation.\n    * This helps in representing the classes required.\n* Label Encoding\n    * Unlike one-hot encoding, it does not add a column, instead it assigns each class with a number.\n* Target Encoding\n    * Aligns unique categorical values with the target feature based on the average relationships.\n    * So basically, we assign each label its mean of the target variables.\n* **Note that here we will be using label encoding.**","3d22a039":"* Seperate numerical and categorical features\n* Further seperate numerical features into continuous and discrete features.","e739fe3a":"# Handling Outliers\n* This is the hardest part because of the fact that finding the range beyond which an observation is considered outlier.\n* However, a very beautiful article

explains it very easily.\n* Since, we have not yet transformed the data, the we are using 1.5*IQR (Inter Quartile Range) as the threshold.","34123d2e":"# Handling Temporal Variables\n* The best way to handle temporal variable is to convert it into \"age\".\n* This means that suppose a building was built in 2000 and was sold in 2010, then its age is 10 years.\n* This goes for all temporal features.","23486110":"# Lifecycle\n* This notebook implements the second part of lifecycle process i.e Feature Engineering.\n* Following is the list of lifecycle processes.\n    * Data Analysis or

categorical and temporal features.\n* Then we have handled outliers and after handling missing values.\n* Further, we have combined rare labels and created a new label called \"Others_R\"\n* At this point, we have **preprocessed** the data to an extent that any model can generate the results.\n* However, the work of feature engineering is not yet over.\n* We may still scale and transform the data to make it more ideal and align it to a particular distribution (like Gaussian\/Normal distribution).\n* This helps for the model to improve its performance and in turn its accuracy.","e950110b":"# Log-Transform the data\n* Follow [this article](https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/logarithms-what-why-and-how-ff9d050d3fd7) to understand the know hte basics of log transform.\n* After understanding what is it and what it does, the main question is what are the features on which log transformation needs to be applied or how to select the features for log-transformation.\n* We select those features that are right skewed as the features that require log transformation.\n* We further make sure that we don't select those features that have either bimodal or multimodal distribution.\n* These are selected based on EDA done previously.","9540d58c":"# Handling Rare Records for Categorical Features\n* I consider \"Rare\" classes for a categorical feature as those classes whose frequency

model.","70828aec":"# Standardizing features"}}
