It includes variables indicating age, job, marital status, education, whether they have credit in default, whether they have a housing loan, whether they have a personal loan. \n\nData related to the last contact of the current campaign contain variables indicating the mode of communication, month of last communication, day of week when the last contact was made and the last call duration. \n\nSocial and economic context attributes contain variables with the quarterly employment variation rate, monthly consumer price index, monthly consumer confidence index, number of employees and the euribor 3 month rate. \n\nOther attributes include number of previous contacts with the client during the current campaign, number of days since the last contact for the previous campaign, number of contacts performed before the current campaign for the client and the outcome of the previous marketing campaign. \n\nThe goal of the project is to classify with high accuracy whether the campaign will be successful or not given a set of input variables.\n\n**Proposed Plan:** \n\nIn this project I will use the above data parameters to predict the outcome of the marketing campaign for the customer. \n\nI will be using Matplotlib and Seaborn for basic visualization and exploratory data analysis. I will also be making use of pandas packages to wrangle the data. Some data wrangling techniques that we will be using are imputation of missing\/ NA data values, and converting categorical variables to numeric variables using one hot encoding. \n\nFor classification, I am planning on using:\n1. Logistic Regression \n2. Random Forests \n3. K-Nearest Neighbours \n4. Support Vector Machines\n5. Neural Networks. \n\nThe preliminary challenges that I might face would be in data wrangling and feature selection. Since there are 20 variables to fit the models and predict the outcome of the survey, it would be a challenge to select only those features which have a significant impact on the response variable. We plan to carry out feature engineering to create new features based on pre-existing ones.\n\n**Preliminary Results:**\n\nAfter performing exploratory data analysis, it was found that social and economic context attributes affect the outcome the most. The bank client data and data related to the last campaign had little to no effect on the outcome. We will use this as a basis to start building our machine learning models. Hence, we will be able to produce feasible models.","0f931730":"Output has a good correlation with duration, pdays, emp.var.rate, euribor3m and nr.employed. Therefore they might form a very good features compared to others.\nWe should also note that emp.var.rate has a high correlation with nr.employed, euribor3m and cons.price.idx. So we might need to consider this while selecting our features.","937776a3":"**Thanks for Dropping by.**\n\n**Please consider upvoting** if you like the notebook.\n\nIf you have any suggestions and improvements please consider dropping them in comments and I will definetly go over them. \n\n**Thanks in Advance**","81794996":" <i> Visualisation related to \"Contact, Month and Day of the week\" <\/i>","cb00848e":"##### 3.1 Undersampling","2fc580dd":"From the above graphs we can see that Housing and loan remains almost constant and dont have much if an effect.
