Nearly all large cities shifted further Democratic than they did in 2016, though notable exceptions include Chicago, Miami (wow!), and El Paso.  Rural areas, represented by the smallest data points, are nearly all a shade of red, especially in middle and eastern America.  There also exists a pattern of the greatest Republican shifts occuring in Southern Texas near the border while the greatest Democratic shifts occur in the populous upper east coast which includes New York and New Jersey.\n\nOverall, this map tells a story of a country where solid red areas have shifted even further red while solid blue areas shift even further blue, illustrating the partisan conviction of many areas of the country even compared to 2016.","f5db1ae7":"Consistent with previous elections, the big cities appear far more Democratic whereas the rural areas are far more Republican.
