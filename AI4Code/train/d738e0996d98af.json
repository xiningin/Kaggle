Most of them are not dangerous as they present with mild symptoms and can be treated symptomatically, but it killed around 858 people from Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2015, this is because of its severe presentation causing respiratory failure. Undiscovered coronaviruses like the Wuhan Coronavirus are very dangerous because specific treatment for such viruses is not yet available and it rapidly progresses to cause multiorgan failure. This category of the virus causes harmful diseases in mammals as well as in birds. In humans, the virus causes mild respiratory infections, which in rare cases may even cause death. In animals like cows and pigs, it causes diarrhea, while in chickens it causes severe respiratory infections. You may be shocked to know that there are no vaccines currently available for the treatment of this disease.\n\nWhen it comes to the basic description of the virus, Coronavirus comes under the sub-family Orthocoronavirinae. It has been surrounded by an envelope like a frame, which gives a definite sense of the single-stranded RNA genome. The shape of their nucleocapsid is helical. The size of coronaviruses ranges from 26 to 32 kilobases. It is the largest category for an RNA virus. In most cases, it is difficult to detect if coronavirus or a different cold-causing virus is causing you fever.\n\nKnown as \u201cCOVID-19\u201d, the newly identified coronavirus can cause pneumonia, and like other respiratory infections, it has an incubation of between 1 and 14 days.\n\nWhat exactly is a coronavirus?\n\nEarly discovered in the 1960s, the name of this virus comes from the crown-like spikes that it has its surface. The word corona came from the Latin word \u201cCrown.\u201d Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses that infect animals and mammals like bats, pigs. Scientists call them zoonotic because they get a transfer from animals to humans.\n\nCauses for infection from coronavirus:\n\nScientists have experimentally identified that there are two possible reasons for the disease from coronavirus:\n\nConsumption of wildlife foods such as bats: The most common cause of the infection of the coronavirus is eating wild animals. Most of the cases have come across for eating bats and snakes.\nAnimal pathogens: The body physiology of every animal is different; thus, every animal have some specific micro-organism residing in their body \u2014 Eating them affects the incompatibility in the creature and the chance of traditional suffering increases.\nTransmission: Transmission of coronavirus takes place while making contact with a surface or object that has the virus and then touching your nose, eyes, or mouth.\nSigns and Symptoms of the Infection:\n\nMany people get infected with coronaviruses at one point in their lives, but symptoms are typically mild to moderate. In some cases, the viruses can cause lower-respiratory tract illnesses such as pneumonia and bronchitis.\n\nCoronavirus usually affects the respiratory system in human, so the various symptoms traditionally observed in human beings are:-\n\nA general feeling of being unwell\nRespiratory illness\nNose running\nCoughing\nSore throat\nFever\nChills\nPneumonia\nDifficulty in breathing\nKidney failure","0856431b":"# COVID 19 EDA ANALYSIS \nby- Yash Mestry\nLETS DIVE INTO THE ANALYSIS "}}
