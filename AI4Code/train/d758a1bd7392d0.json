Moreover, with surge in number users accessing social media these days, this task cannot be done manually with help of moderators. So to automate the identification of toxic comments on social media platforms, The Conversation AI team had come up with an interesting kaggle competition to build a roboust machine learning model that can do this task.\n\nFor this competition, we are provided a annotated dataset of comments from Wikipedia\u2019s talk page edits. Using this as training data, we are challenged to build a multi-headed machine learning model that is capable of detecting different types of of toxicity like obscenity, threats, insults, and identity-based hate better than existing machine learning models (yes, conversational AI team already has a model to do this).\n\nMore details of the competition can be found here: \n> source: [kaggle](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge)\n\n\n### Data & Evaluation metrics:\n\n`train.csv` contains a large number of Wikipedia comments (around 100K+) which have been labeled by human raters for toxic behavior. The types of toxicity are:\n\n`toxic\n severe_toxic\n obscene\n threat\n insult\n identity_hate`\n \n- Apart from the above mentioned classes there will be also completely clean comments.\n- The trained model will be tested on `test.csv` data using mean column-wise ROC AUC as evaluation metric.\n- **Mean column-wise ROC AUC = Average of the individual ROC AUC scores of each predicted class. **\n\nSubmission File Format:\n\nFor each id in the test set, you must predict a probability for each of the six possible types of comment toxicity (toxic, severetoxic, obscene, threat, insult, identityhate). The columns must be in the same order as shown below. The file should contain a header and have the following format:\n\n`id,toxic,severe_toxic,obscene,threat,insult,identity_hate\n 00001cee341fdb12,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5\n 0000247867823ef7,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5\n etc.`","9e2d6516":"### Splitting the data into Training & Validation sets:\n\nBefore testing the model on the actual test data, we neeed to cross-validate internally that model is trained in a right way.

I am using `random_state = 2019`as seed for purpose of reproducability & `test_size` = 0.2 meaning 20% of data points in the train set will be used as validation data and remaining 80% of data will be used to train the model.\n\n","0223be3c":"- so what is OneVsRestClassifier doing here? \n\n- This is basically wrapper that converts the problem of 6 class multi-label problem into 6 individual binary classifications .i.e it builds 6 multinomialNB models.

My next target is to improve to score to more than 0.98 using only linear models.\n\n### how about using deep neural nets, CNNs & LSTMs ?\n- with amount of data we are having it is possible for deep neural nets might provide better results.\n- But Let say after preprocessig & tuning our final Logistic model is having ROC-AUC of 0.98 on average & for some LSTM model is having ROC-AUC of 0.99..I am question myself, is it worth training & deploying such complex model which we can't interpret for an improvement of just 0.01 score ? If would **NO** but in the kaggle competitions, every improvement in 0.0001 score matters...so may be we can try LSTMs after all to improve our knowledge..but in production I would prefer to say NO Again it ultimately depends on serverity of the problem & several other factors.","aa019ed5":"- presence of captial letters is more in case of unclean comments, but the distrbutions are overlapping making it a difficult feature for models to extract information.\n- most of the clean comments are having punctuations less than 100 while for unclean comments it spread to max of 5000 punctuations.\n- no.of smilies in unclean v\/s clean comments is very much similar and unclean comments are having more comments with no.of smilies = 1.","72bdb19e":"#### 3.
