So, remove movie(s) from dataset","1b5b2008":"## Project overview\nTo see a more robust version of this project, please check out [my github repository][github]. I use Amazon Sagemaker to train a model using XGBoost, which gave me more accurate predictions, and an R^2 score of 0.829.\n\nFor this project, I will be using the [5000 movies dataset][db], and supervised learning, to predict the user score for a film. The motivation behind this project comes from my [benchmark model][kernel], by Ashwini Swain; here, Swain makes accurate movie-score predictions (average accuracy of about 98.5% among three movies (Godfather Part 3, Minions, Rocky Balboa)) by comparing films' genres, actors, directors, and keywords. Then, to predict the average, Swain does the following:\n- Calculate the cosine similarity among other movies\n  - First by creating binary-arrays for the lists of genres, actors, directors, and keywords\n  - Then, by using scipy's cosine similarity method to compare the arrays with those of other movies\n- Takes the top 10 similar movies\n- Calculates the average of these 10 movies' user scores\n- Uses that average as the prediction for the subject movie's score\nI used his algortihm with 10 random movies to get an average accuracy of about 87%. Because it takes too long to predict the score of all movies in the dataset, it must be noted that this score may or may not represent the overall accuracy of all movie predictions\n\nFor my project, instead of using a cosine-similarity algorithm, I will use machine learning to predict a movie's score. To do this, I will: \n- create a decimal representation of the features: genres, actors, directors, keywords, and production companies\n  - Like Swain has done, I will create a binary array for each feature. Then, I will analyze the array like points in a number line\n    - Looking at the points, I can identify a point that best describes the distribution of 1's, and use that as a decimal representation of the feature\n- normalize the decimal values to be within [0,1]\n- Split data into training and testing sets\n  - 70% for training, 30% for testing\n- Train a regression-based model using Scikit learn's Bayesian Ridge\n- Make predictions and evaluate using an R^2 score\n\nI will only use movies that fall under this criteria\n - Rating of movie is greater than 0.0 (0,0 rating corresponds to movies with 0 or 1 votes, so there's no telling if the rating is an accurate representation of the movie)\n - Movie has at least one of the following features: cast, crew, production companies\n[\/\/]: # (These are reference links used in the body of this note and get stripped out when the markdown processor does its job.
