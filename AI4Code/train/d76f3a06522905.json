Certain types of hazards are most likely to affect vulnerable populations, and thus should include actions to mitigate that impact.\n* There are also some secondary insights that certain types of projects have been reported as potentially more beneficial for vulnerable populations: economic diversification, low flow technologies, retrofit existing buildings, (for poverty reduction), and community engagement\/education (for social inclusion).","5e06d46b":"### Which types of hazards most frequently affect vulnerable populations?\n\n* Cities reported that **cyclones, heat waves, and cold waves** are the hazards that most frequently affect vulnerable populations.\n* More generally, the data suggests that almost all types of hazards can and do impact vulnerable populations.","5ada17ac":"### Which types of actions most frequently benefit poverty reduction?\n* Cities report that **economic diversification measures and promotion of low flow technologies** are types of actions that most frequently have a beneficial impact on poverty reduction.","b1309129":"## Exploratory Analysis","003dbacd":"### Which cities have the highest action scores?\n* **Buenos Aires, Montecario, Leon**, etc. have the highest action scores.\n* Compared to the distribution of awareness scores, there are relatively few cities that achieved high action scores.\n* Some cities achieved high scores by reporting a small number of hazards and a large proportion of actions aimed at protecting vulnerable populations (ex.

Conclusion\n\nThis notebook has taken up the challenge of using CDP\u2019s data to develop key performance indicators (KPIs) that can help cities adapt to climate change in ways that are socially equitable. First, I analyzed the data reported by cities about the climate hazards they face, and selected KPIs for measuring their awareness of how these hazards are affecting the most vulnerable populations within their communities. Second, I analyzed the data reported by cities about the actions they are taking to mitigate climate hazards, and selected KPIs for measuring the extent to which these actions prioritize the protection of vulnerable populations. Finally, I combined these KPIs into an overall climate equity score for each city and compared the results to those of CDPs own scoring system.\n\nMy analysis shows that most cities in the CDP data have not thoroughly incorporated social equity and inclusion into their responses to climate change, though some progress is being made. \n\nMost of the progress has been in the growing awareness by city governments of the disproportionate impact that climate hazards have on their most vulnerable residents. More than half (53.5%) of the cities in the CDP data report having carried out a climate impact assessment that identifies vulnerable populations. This incorporation of social equity into the assessment process is helping to bring into sharper focus a picture of how climate hazards are affecting vulnerable populations. For example, cities provided data showing which types of climate hazards are most likely to affect which types of vulnerable populations. \n\nHowever, the growing awareness among city governments of how climate hazards are disproportionately affecting their most vulnerable residents has not yet translated into a corresponding increase in mitigation efforts that prioritize the protection of those residents. Although cities acknowledge that 55% of the climate hazards they face are increasing the risks to already vulnerable populations, they report that only 4% of their responses to those same hazards include actions aimed at protecting the most vulnerable.\n\nNevertheless, my analysis of the CDP data draws attention to certain cities that are leading the way toward greater urban climate equity. Cities like Buenos Aires in South America, Tagum City in Asia, and Louisville in North America (some of which do not appear on CDP\u2019s A-List) have significantly incorporated social equity and inclusion into both their assessments of local climate impacts and their efforts to mitigate those impacts. The data reported by such leading cities in climate equity point to best practices that could be adopted by their peers. For example, cities that report taking actions to protect vulnerable populations also provide evidence that these efforts can help to reduce poverty and improve social inclusion in urban communities.\n\nThe analysis in this notebook hardly exhausts the many insights to be gained from CDP\u2019s extremely rich collection of data. First of all, I have mainly focused on the more readily quantifiable answers that cities provided on the CDP questionnaire, but they also provided substantial textual descriptions of both climate hazards and actions that could be profitably mined with natural language processing. Perhaps the most obvious next step is to incorporate the data collected by CDP in years prior to 2020, which would facilitate examining the trends in urban climate equity over time. The analysis would also surely benefit from incorporating the data from CDP\u2019s questionnaires for corporations, which cities often partner with in tackling climate issues. However, any analysis focused primarily on the CDP data will continue to suffer from its geographical limitations until more cities in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East start to participate in the global disclosure system.","6b2447ea":"### Which cities have the highest overall climate equity scores?\n* The highest scoring cities are: **Buenos Aires, Tagum City, Leon de los Aldamas, Montecario,** etc. \n* The top 10 is dominated by cities in **Latin America**, and the United States is not well represented.","16dc2d4c":"### Which cities have the highest awareness scores?\n* **Nottingham, Salem, Chihuahua, and Tagum** have the highest awareness scores.\n* There are many cities with high awareness scores.\n* Some cities achieved high scores by reporting only a few hazards but many affects on vulnerable populations (ex. Chihuahua).","06b26611":"The 2020 CDP dataset includes public responses from 566 different cities. Each \u201ccity\u201d is represented by the organization that responded to the questionnaire, typically the local city government. A \u201ccity\u201d in the CDP dataset is therefore defined by administrative boundaries that may encompass more or less than the full extent of the local urban community.

The CDP Data\n\nCDP collects environmental data from cities through its [global disclosure system](http:\/\/www.cdp.net\/en\/guidance\/guidance-for-cities).

All responses are completely voluntary and there is no minimum amount of data required for submission. Cities can opt to make their responses non-public if they do not want their data to be identified in CDP\u2019s reports and open datasets.\n\nThe present notebook focuses on the most recent data that CDP collected using its [2020 questionnaire for cities](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/cdp-unlocking-climate-solutions\/data).

Cities need to pay more attention to and report these other connections between climate hazards and vulnerable populations.","c4dd3bce":"# 1. Introduction\n\nIn cities around the world, some people are more vulnerable than others to the growing impact of climate change. When heat waves, hurricanes, flash floods, and other types of climate hazards strike urban communities, the hardest hit are usually low-income households, minorities, the elderly, and other marginalized groups who are both highly exposed and lack the resources with which to effectively respond. In order to adapt to climate change in ways that are socially inclusive and equitable, cities therefore need to prioritize the protection of these vulnerable populations. However, while some city governments are starting to lead the way, most have yet to fully incorporate social equity considerations into their climate plans and actions.([1](http:\/\/wrirosscities.org\/research\/publication\/how-tackle-climate-change-and-inequality-jointly-cities))\n\nThe issue of urban climate equity is the focus of a recent Kaggle competition, [CDP: Unlocking Climate Solutions](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/cdp-unlocking-climate-solutions). The competition was hosted by the [Climate Disclosure Project](https:\/\/www.cdp.net\/en) (CDP), an international non-profit organization that runs a global disclosure system for cities and companies to report their environmental impacts. Through this disclosure system, CDP has amassed the most comprehensive collection of self-reported environmental data in the world. For the Kaggle competition, the organization made a large amount of its most recent data [publicly available](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/cdp-unlocking-climate-solutions\/data) and challenged participants to develop Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to help cities adapt to climate change in ways that are socially equitable.\n\nThe present notebook takes up CDP\u2019s challenge by developing a climate equity score for individual cities based on the public data. My approach focuses on measuring the *efforts* that cities are making to incorporate social equity into their climate responses, rather than the *outcomes* of such efforts. This approach is in keeping with the nature of the CDP data, which is voluntarily self-reported by city leaders without independent verification. For example, a lack of data reported on how climate hazards are negatively affecting vulnerable populations in a particular city is less likely to indicate a positive *outcome* of inclusive climate policies than to reflect a poor *effort* by that city to incorporate social equity into its climate impact assessments. Accordingly, the central question addressed by this notebook is: *How well are cities incorporating social equity into their climate adaptation efforts?*\n\nFirst, the notebook discusses the scope and limitations of the CDP data in more detail. Second, it explores what the data can tell us about the climate hazards that are currently affecting cities worldwide, with specific focus on how these hazards impact vulnerable populations. Third, it examines the information that cities report about the actions they are taking in response to climate hazards, again with an emphasis on how these actions aim to protect vulnerable populations. Finally, it combines the foregoing analysis of climate hazards and actions into a composite score for each individual city and extracts insights about the current state of urban climate equity across the world. The notebook concludes with a summary of the findings and next steps for future study.","6a32d6f4":"### Which vulnerable populations are most frequently affected by cyclones (hurricanes and typhoons)?\n* Cities report that **the elderly and low income households** are most frequently affected by cyclones.","62fadebb":"## Exploratory Analysis","cfc89100":"### Which types of actions most frequently benefit social inclusion?\n* Cities report that **mangrove planting, sea level rise adaptation planning, and promotion of low flow technologies** most frequently benefit social inclusion.\n* However, it is unclear whether the data on mangrove planting and sea level adapation is actually statistically significant because in each case only one action was reported.","6ef05e43":"### Which types of actions are beneficial to social inclusion?\n* Cities report that **projects targetting vulnerable populations** are by far the most beneficial for social inclusion, followed by **community engagement and education**.\n* This suggests that community engagement on climate hazards is an important way for cities to overcome the social marginalization of vulnerable populations."}}
