Lower cases are seen with death rate from lung diseases varying in the lower levels. On the contrary we should not ignore that higher number of cases are also seen to fall in that range. \n\nOwing to the highly contagious nature of the pandemic, even countries with high healthcare systems are not likely to escape adverse effect, as shown by hospital bed per\/1000 and health expenditure plots in the figure above. \n\nTemperature has a positive correlation and humidity has negative correlation indicating higher temperature and low humid countries could also be vulnerable. But there are no strong evidience against it and could'nt be strongly advocated.\n\nVulnereablity of the pandemic is not limited to countries with lower income.

But the date on which COVID entered a country and when community spread started is different from country to country. Conducting an analysis with all the countries together will lead to confusion. So the main goal is to identify the countries in pandemic state and find out the common features which are main factors for covid spread. These factors are then used to identify country\/group more prone for infection or in high risk state.\n\nNote: Data available only till the end of March 2020","03f146c7":"We have a smooth distribution above fair vicinity of 25th percentile of the distribution of the median age. Hence 25th percentile is taken as the lower limit and age groups below could be ignore. \n\nAs we have seen before as age increases the vulerablitiy to the sickness also increases. Therfore it is thought that capping the upper limit makes ambiguity and some countries with higher median age group in their population could be missed out, for whom it is highly likely to get adversely affected.
