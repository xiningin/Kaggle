This could be useful in our algorithm.\n- `Aspect`\n    - This feature has a normal distribution for each class.\n- `Slope`\n    - Slope has lower values compared to most features as its measured in degrees and least to `Aspect` which is also measured in degrees.\n    - It has the least maximum value of all features. Looking at the plot we can say that it belongs to `Cover_Type2`.\n    - All classes have dense slope observations between 0-20 degrees.\n- `Horizontal_Distance_To_Hydrology`\n    - This has the right or positively skewed distribution where most of the values for all classes are towards 0-50m.\n- `Vertical_Distance_To_Hydrology`\n    - This is also positively skewed distribution but this takes on values much closer to 0 for all classes for most observations.\n    - The highest value in this feature belongs to `Cover_Type2`. This feature also has the least minimum value. In this case, `Cover_Type2` has the most range of observations compared to other classes.\n- `Hillshade_9am` and `Hillshade_Noon` are left or negatively skewed distribution where they take on max value between 200-250 index value for most observation in each class.\n- `Hillshade_3pm` has a normal distribution for all classes.","f9db67e2":"## Train-Test Split\nNow we can split into 75% - 25% train-test set respectively.","b8bc96dc":"# Model Evaluation\nNext we will feed our data to see how each model performs using two evaluation metrics: **accuracy** and **f1 score**:\n- **Accuracy** is the measure of the correct predicted data divided by total number of observations hence giving a value ranfing between 0 and 1, while 0 is no correctly predicted class and 1 is all correctly predicted class.\n- **f1 score** is more useful than accuracy epescially in the case where you have uneven amount of class distribution as in our case. It's the weighted average of precision and recall. Therefore, this score takes both false positives and false negatives into account.\n- Accuracy works best if false positives and false negatives have similar cost. If the cost of false positives and false negatives are very different, it's better to look at both precision and recall or f1 score.\n\n\nWe will do the following:\n- Train the data on training set and test the performance on the benchmark model (Naive Bayes Classifier).\n- Use 10 K-Fold CV to test the performance of our model.","d8f9ae8c":"# Train Final Model\nWe will be choosing `ExtraTreesClassifier` for our submission model.","2466b2db":"## Feature Scaling\nBefore train-test split, we will scale the features to some specific range.

Describe numerical features\n- **mean** of the feature varies from 16 to 2749.\n- **std** for `Horizontal_Distance_To_Roadways` is the most spread out data, followed by `Horizontal_Distance_To_Fire_Points` and `Elevation`.\n- The most desnsed and near to mean is `Slope` followed by all 3 features of `Hillshade`. \n    - See **Boxplot #1** in *Feature Visualization Section*\n- All features have a minimum value of 0 except `Elevation` and `Vertical_Distance_To_Hydrology` features.\n    - `Elevation` has the highest minimum value and `Vertical_Distance_To_Hydrology` has a negative value.\n- `Hillshades` features except `Hillshade_3pm` have a similar maximum value.\n- `Horizontal_Distance_To_Fire_Points` has the highest maximum value followed by `Horizontal_Distance_To_Roadways` features. They also have the highest ranges of all features.\n- `Slope` has the lowest maximum value and range. The `Aspect` feature follows closely behind this same concept.\n\nIt is good to note that the reason some features are widely spread and have high values, is because 5 out of the 10 variables are measured in meters. These variables are: `Elevation`,`Horizontal_Distance_To_Hydrology`,`Vertical_Distance_To_Hydrology`,`Horizontal_Distance_To_Roadways`,`Horizontal_Distance_To_Fire_Points`. This makes sense that these have high values and ranges.\n\n\nFeatures like `Aspect` and `Slope` are measured in degrees which means there maximum values can't go above 360. `Hillshade` features can only take on a maximum value of 255.\n","0928a5ad":"Feed the top 20 features in a variable as a dataframe including the target variable. To determine this most of the similar features pop up in all four classifiers, while adding on the 10 additional **soil types** that were placed in the top.","696d8721":"#### Skewness Inferences\n- `Soil_Type8` and `Soil_Type25` has the highest skewness. This means that the mass of the distribution is concentrated to the left and has long tail to the right followed by `Soil_Type9, 28 and 26`. This is also called **right skewed distribution**. \n    - We can see here that mostly all of the observations will have a 0 value for this feature in the **Feature Visualization Section**: **Barplot #3**\n- The `Hillshade` variables have a negatively skewed distribution.\n- ML algorithm can be very sensitive to such ranges of data and can give us inappropriate\/weak restuls. **Feature Scaling** will handle these as discussed earlier.","a1694876":"### Feature Distribution\nNow we will plot how Wilderness_Area are distributed.","15c8d0dc":"### 1. K-Nearest Neighbors","f93fcd50":"### AdaBoost Classifier","47b96425":"#### Model Inferences:\n- All models work better than our benchmark model.\n- **ETC** performs the best with an accuracy of 84.59% and f1 score of 84.32% respectively taking the least amount of time running cross validation and metric results. Also given its flexibility it performed well with default parameters.\n- **RF** performs at second best to ETC. Along with ETC it is interesting to see as their results might be high and close enough. Some tuning of the parameters would probably get a better result.\n- **KNN** performs a little under RF. This is usual because KNN works well with datasets that have doublets. Since we checked the data for no duplicates, KNN can only choose the most similar samples by distance. While RF and ETC cal learn other definitions of locality which could stretch far by some features and short by others.","0ee8c4d3":"#### Part 2. Describe categorical features\n- Categorical variables will either have a value of 0 or 1. The **mean** can tell us useful information.\n    - `Wilderness_Area3` followed by `Wilderness_Area4` has the highest mean. This signifies that these variables have the most presence in the data compared to other Wilderness Area. Most of our features will consist of `Wilderness_Area3` and `Wilderness_Area4`.\n    - The least amount of observations will be seen from `Wilderness_Area2`.\n- One more to notice here is that when we add all the mean of `Wilderness_Area` we get a result 0.999999 which is approximately 1. This may mean all the observations can be from any one Wilderness Area. (Cross Check Here: **xx**)\n- Probability wise, the next observation that we get will have a 42.0% probability take from `Wilderness_Area3`, 30.9% probability take from `Wilderness_Area4` and so on for others. \n    - We can look into more details with the following plot in the *Feature Visualization Section*: **Barplot #2**.\n- Probability wise, we can document the same for `Soil_Types` too. \n    - We can look at **Barplot** #3 and plot xx in *Feature Visualization Section*.\n\n\nBy looking at these statistics of two different data types, we can see that there is different spreads and uneven amount of distribution. In this case we will feature scale these so that all the features have similar ranges between 0 and 1. Some algorithms can be sensitive to high values hence giving us inappropriate results while some algorithms are not. To be on the safe side, we will feature scale it and will do this in the **Data Engineering** section: **xx**.","a82eee7c":"#### Violin Plot 4.2 Wilderness Area Inferences:\n- `Wilderness_Area1` belongs to forest `Cover_Type1`, `Cover_Type2`, and `Cover_Type5`.\n- `Wilderness_Area3` belongs to all classes except `Cover_Type4`.\n- `Wilderness_Area2` and `Wilderness_Area4` has the least observations, their dense is less on 1 on all classes compared to `Wilderness_Area1` and `Wilderness_Area3`.","94f504a5":"### Gradient Boosting Classifier","41d25650":"### Feature Visualization\nFirst, we will visualize the spread and outliers of the data of numerical features.","13d274df":"# Forest Cover Type Project","d7f74167":"#### Barplot #3: Number of Observations of Soil Type Inferences:\n\n\nNow we will plot the number of observations for `Soil Type`.\n- In the bar plot below, we can see that there many different types of distributions: **normale distribution, bimodal distribution, unimodal distribution, and left & right-skewed distribution** showing up in pieces.\n- The most observation is seen from `Soil_Type10` followed by `Soil_Type29`.\n    - From a statistical analysis, `Soil_Type10` has a presence in 14.1% of observations in the data.\n    - `Soil_Type10` also had the least skewed value of all in Soil Types as we had seen earlier in data exploration.\n- The variable with the least amount of observations are `Soil_Type7` and `Soil_Type15`.\n    - Soil Types has the most skewed values because these variables with a skew variable of 0 were so little, making it densely concentrated towards 0 and long flat tail to the right having form of **positively skewed distribution** or **right skewed distribution** (Details in *Feature Skew* Section).","b9c9c239":"### Class Distribution\nNow we will look at the class distribution for `Cover_Type` by grouping it and calculating total occurrence.\n\n\nWe can see that `Cover_Type` has an equal distribution.","d28b9624":"## Data Exploration\n### Feature Statistics\n- Part 1.

The features do show up in different ranks, but not a great difference.\n- In the **ADB**, the top 8 features are enough to predict classess. It is interesting to see that `Wilderness_Area4` ties with `Elevation` because scores pretty low in the other classifiers.\n- `Elevation` takes on a similar dominance in each classifier.\n- `Hillshade` features are seen on the top 10 list of every classifier except for **ADB**.\n- In the feature visualization section of *correlation*, we saw that `Hillshade` features had a nice correlation with each other and other features like `Slope`, `Aspect`, and `Horizontal_Distance_To_Roadways`. They also show dominance in predicting, meaning they might had correlated but they have useful information in predicting the target variable.\n- `Elevation`, `Vertical` and `Horizontal` Distance to Hydrology show presence in top 10 for all classifiers.\n- `Horizontal Distance To Roadways` and `Fire Points` have the highest standard deviation including outliers im all classifiers except in **ADB**.\n\nAll this being said, these classification show that numerical features dominate when it comes to predicting forest classes. Now we will consider the top 15 to 20 features as a reasonable choice.","8e99f85f":"#### Boxplot #1: Numerical Features Inferences\n- `Slope` is the most squeezed box plot. It having a least range means that the **median** and **mean** will be quite close.\n- `Aspect` features is the only one with little to none outliers. Since both `Aspect` and `Slope` are measure in degrees, `Aspect` takes on much bigger range than `Slope` because it has the lowest max score, which means `Aspect` is less densed than `Slope`.\n- The `Hillshade` features also have a similar plot to Slope, which includes many outliers and taking on a smaller range.\n- `Vertical_Distance_To_Hydrology` is also similar to Slope except here the minimum value is negative.\n- `Elevation` is the only feature that doesn't have a minimum value of 0. It is instead plotted in the middle having many outliers too.\n- `Horizontal_Distance_To_Roadways` has the most spread out data of all features. This is because it has highest standard deviation score. `Horizontal_Distance_To_Fire_Points` has a similar look, but it has the maximum value.\n    - If we compare these two features, the last 50% of `Horizontal_Distance_To_Roadways` is much more spread and less dense compared to `Horizontal_Distance_To_Fire_Points`, hence having a high standard deviation score.","e86be770":"### Feature Skew\n- For normal distribution, the skewness should be zero.

The right tail is long relative the left tail.","3d98a132":"#### Scatterplot #6 Features with correlation greater than 0.5\nLet's look at the paired features with correlation greater than 0.5.

This will make the algorithm run slowly, which may give ML models difficulty learning, overfitting in the training set, and do worse in submission\/testing.\n- We also see from checking for missing values and duplicates that `Wilderness_Area` and `Soil_Type` have no category that has no observations. This means that every feature has presence and we can't just delete because it may play an importance for the ML models in predicting classes.\n\n\nTo approach the problem, in this section we will see how each feature has an impact on predicting classes. We will use the following classifiers: **Extra Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Classifiers**. We will also use **AdaBoost** that will offer us the attribute `feature_importance_` to see which feature has more importance compared to others any by how much.","56d60d88":"### Handling Missing Values\nLooks like we have no missing values."}}
