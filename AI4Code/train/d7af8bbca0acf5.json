The G20 organization has countries that score highly on anti-corruption (developed) & countries who don't (developing)\n1. The BRICS one shows that these developing countries seem to be moving in the right direction (maybe, too slowly), but they still have ways to go before they can catch up to the developed nations\n1. The European countries are all in the 40-90 range, which means that all of them have achieved some success in fighting corruption\n1. The Arab states have a score in the range of 10-50 (except 2 countries) & a lot of work is needed to fight & eliminate corruption","f6953d31":"## Let's see how the various countries in different organizations do on corruption over the years","2ca7f588":"## Let's see geographically how corruption has changed over the years","f0420d64":"1.
