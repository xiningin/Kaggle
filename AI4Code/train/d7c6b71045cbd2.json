Point Maps**: These maps are geographical maps with dots placed at specific spatial locations that represent data points .*Dot size, color, or shape *can be varied to add a layer of comparitive detail when you look at the map.\n\nPoint Maps use dots (points, markers) to demonstrate the existence of a subject or a feature. It's a lot like Bubble Maps (Proportional Symbol Maps), but the dots' sizes don't depend on their values, as there's no size setting. Usually the tooltips are formatted to show some information about points - so these maps are very useful and popular in census, tourism, health service and any other researches.Spreading points (or dots) across a Map is rather alike scatter (or marker) series. So, in AnyChart, this series in maps is of Marker type.\n\nNote that when you use this type to draw density maps they must be drawn on an equal area map projection. This is critical - using a map projection which does not preserve the size of areas will distort the perceived density of the dots.\n\nThere are two general types of Marker Maps: One-To-One and One-To-Many. One-To-One is a type where a marker stands for an only feature, event or any other subject. One-To-Many means that one marker describes several subjects or values. There is no difference in setting the data, this is just general information that doesn't affect the way of managing the data.\n\nHere is a basic sample of point map:\n\n <img src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/cy0L1ZW.png\">\n \n There are **specific requirements** for generating points maps .They are as follows:\n    \n  - Precise x-,y- positions data for each observation\n  - A 'marker' parameter (instead of z-parameter)\n  - Data parameter:type='Scattergeo'\n  \n### Generating Point Maps","115df8d1":"Next we need to create the layout object ","a4773381":"Let us take a sample of the snow dataframe for our data visualisation","9130db9b":"\n# Interactive Maps using Plotly\n\n**Plotly** creates leading open source tools for composing, editing, and  sharing interactive data visualization.\n\nPlotly is the simplest way to generate maps that are \n\n- Interactive\n\n- Web Friendly \n\n- Easily Shareable\n\n**There are two types of Plotly Mapping Objects**\n\n**Data Objects** : A list object that contains a dictionary specifying each of the parameters for the map's data.\n\n**Layout Objects:** A nested dictionary object that specifies each of the parameters for the map's layout\n\nThis kernel will cover the following types of maps using Plotly\n\n**1. Cholopleth Maps** : These maps are geographical maps where spatial areas are colored in hues that represent the quantity of a given attribute in the specific geographic region.It is a thematic map in which areas are shaded or patterned in proportion to the measurement of the statistical variable being displayed on the map, such as population density or per-capita income.\n\n  <img src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/anrKfG6.png\">\n  \n  There are **specific requirements** for generating Cholopleth maps .They are as follows\n  \n  - Use the \"code\" parameter to select the geographical areas by name like \"States\"\n  - Data parameter : type = 'cholopleth'","7cf1ef4a":"# If you like to this kernel greatly appreciate to UPVOTE . \u00a0Thank you.\n","0e94a6e0":"The dollars column shows how many dollars are spent per year per student.\n\nSATV describes average SAT verbal score in the SATM which is the average math score of high school students.\n\nOne key observation here is that the dataset does not have a latitude or longitude values which may be alarming since we are going to construct a map.However we do not a precise latitude or longitude values unless we are making a point map.This is where the column called 'code' comes to our rescue .\n\nNow let us add a new column 'text' which will use it for printing out the label statistics about states as we mouse over to get SATV score and SATM score by state."}}
