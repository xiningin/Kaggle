Train the model with $n$ `steps` to produce the output from input\n    2. Train the model with 1 `steps` to produce output from output\n        * This enforces that the CA stabilizes after reaching a solution\n        \nIn this way the model will try to get as close to a solution as possible in 1 step, then try to get closer in the next step, and so on until $N$ steps.
