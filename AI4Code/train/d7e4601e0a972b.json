The folder is named like your dataset as you can see in the sidebar.\n* Activate GPU accelerator for this notebook. The free Kaggle account only allow one active GPU, so you might have to go back to your first notebook and disable GPU support in that one first.\n* The code is the same as in *part 1*. Run the code cells, adjust hyperparameters, and see what results you can achieve.\n* If you know Python programming you can make a copy of the dcgan utility script and see if you can do any changes to the code to improve your results."}}
