Modeling interactions between 3+ variables is a much more involved process and was left for future exploration.\n    * When including interactions between variables other than turf type, the only interaction found to be significant was between 'd_s_sum' and 'rel_y_final'.\n    * The best features by correlation strength and significance testing p-value were:\n        * 'd_o_avg', 'd_o_sum' - how much a player \"spun\" during a play\n            * These were more important injury risks than turf type and didn't appear to be amplified by synthetic turf\n        * 'rel_y_final' - distance from the middle of the field (i.e. a line perpendicular to the yardlines), inverse of proximity to sideline\n            * This was also an important injury risk, but possibly related to turf type\n        * 'd_s_sum', 'd_s_avg' - how much a player accelerated during a play\n            * These were important injury risks, but it was unclear whether they were related-to \/ independent-from turf type\n        * (no categorical features were as predictive as these continuous variables, not even turf type)\n        \n## Final Thoughts\n\nSynthetic turf does appear to be related to a higher risk for non-contact lower-extremity injuries, but a few other simple features calculated from player movement data have relationships of equal or greater statistical significance. Without access to cost information on the removal\/replacement of synthetic turf vs. these injuries, it's difficult to say whether a decision can or should be made regarding turf types. \n\nIt is very clear though, that removing synthetic turf from the NFL is not a silver-bullet solution to this injury issue. More research is needed to monitor the injury risk of players' spin, proximity to the sideline, and acceleration. While there is probably no way to reduce these tendencies without harming the game of football; there may be policies, equipment, or other steps that can be taken to make them safer. If nothing else, based on this movement tracking data, players who experience these risk factors at extreme levels should be examined soon after for subtle injuries that might be exacerbated by further risky movement.","15e3991d":"In order to determine if other features might be better predictors, either alone or in interaction with turf type, further testing is necessary.

The signal-to-noise ratio is extremely low, and none of the individual factors reviewed so far have been truly strong predictors individually.\n\nBased on the factors identified as the (relatively) strongest predictors, a logistic regression model can be fitted to a training subset of the plays and then tested on the remaining test set. As a logistic regression, its predictions are probabilities of injuries occuring on the test plays, and the actual classification as Inj = 0 or Inj = 1 depends on the threshold. \n\nTo evaluate the model's performance, many thresholds are processed to calculate numbers of True Positives (TPs) and False Positives (FP), which are then plotted against each other to form a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. Ideally a classifier has a greater proportion of TP than FP at all thresholds and will be above a diagonal line on this plot. Even in that case though, the statistical metric for classifier quality is the Area Under the Curve (AUC), which can be interpreted on a scale from 1 to 0:\n* 1.0 is best, perfect alignment of predicted classification to actual classification\n* 0.0 is worst, where every record is classified incorrectly\n* 0.5 is NOT considered middling performance, rather it means the model is unable to differentiate the classes at all","0c13f7cb":"Because this dataframe utilizes a large amount of memory and Kaggle's cloud session restarts if it runs out of memory, some workarounds are implemented to use smaller datatypes to store the values.

The NFL is challenging Kagglers to help them examine the effects that playing on synthetic turf versus natural turf can have on player movements and the factors that may contribute to lower extremity injuries.\n\n### Hypotheses:\n* There is a significant increase in injury occurence for plays on synthetic turf vs. plays on natural turf.\n* However, due to the extremely low proportion of plays with injuries overall, turf type alone will barely explain any of the variation in injury occurence. \n* While no other individual play-level factor will explain much more of the variation in injury occurence, those that do will have significant interaction effects with turf type, suggesting that synthetic turf's elevates injury risk through amplifying other risk factors.\n\n### Plan:\n1. Import playtrack data (with some creative workarounds to converse memory), calculate additional columns representing change between observations (acceleration, rotation, etc.)\n1. Group playtrack data into play-level aggregate features, as well as features representing the end of movement during the play (assuming players do not continue tracked movement after experiencing an injury)\n1. Join play-level aggregate features to player-level data (roster role) and game-level data (turf type, stadium type, weather, play role, play role group)\n1. Statistical significance tests for differences in injury occurence:\n    * Split play-level records by turf type and conduct two-sample t-test\n    * Further split play-level records by other categorical\/binary features and conduct multiple logistic regressions to identify significant predictors among categorical features, continuous features, and interaction effects.","2f5938e4":"Again, lots of output due the number of features, but each continuous variable tested appears to have a significant relationship with injury occurence.

Interaction plots are helpful for continuous variables as well, but with 250k+ records, they would be resource-intensive to produce.","294a2bbd":"Again, key takeaways from that wall of output:\n* The significance of almost every continuous variable is muddled when interacting with turf type (\"SynTurf\"), although some were still close to being significant after the interaction effect was isolated, with others were almost entirely insignificant (p-values near 1.0)\n* \"d_o_sum\" and \"d_o_avg\" were both still significant after their interactions with turf type were isolated; while neither have a significant interaction with turf type, they differ in that the significane of turf type is actually lessened by \"d_o_sum\", while \"d_o_avg\" appears to be independent from turf type\n    * This suggests that turf type has a relatively stronger correlation with \"d_o_sum\" than \"d_o_avg\", which would likely be due to another relatively strong correlation with the length of plays (\"obs\" in mlDF).
