The company has rapidly gained influence because of the tech-centered business model. As shown in the graph 1 and 2, the data shows that activity in general helps calory intake, as well as improvement in metabolism. Graph 3 suggest that some users may benefit from sleep related tracking data to assist them with sleep related health concerns.\n\n\n### Target Audience -\nTarget audience for the FitBit Tracker is women that meets following criteria:\n    *Women who are full-time employee or has full-time obligation\n    *Those who are requiring assistance with building better health habits\n    *User that requires sleep assistance\n\n### Recommendation for Bella Beat\n\n1. Provide health recommendation according to heart rate, calory intake, and active time.\n2. Reminder to be active to reduce long period of sedentry time.\n3. Goal setter for steps taken in a day or average through out the week.\n4. Calory calculator, along with calory goal calculated with how active user has been through out the week.\n\nFollwing are assumption made regarding data due to lack of description as well as demographic of data.\n - The data gather is from all woman given that Bella Beat is company catered towards women.\n - Data description for activity, calories, and intensity is lacking, therefore assumed to be calculated properly inhouse.\n - Weight log, heart rate, and some sleep related data is omitted in this analysis due to lack of participant.","e65f8d4c":"### Importing modules","b977c665":"The correlation of how much time users stay still does not seem to show significant change in how long it takes to fall asleep.
