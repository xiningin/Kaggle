\"\"\"Encode categorical features as a numeric array.\n    The input to this transformer should be a matrix of integers or strings,\n    denoting the values taken on by categorical (discrete) features.\n    The features can be encoded using a one-hot aka one-of-K scheme\n    (``encoding='onehot'``, the default) or converted to ordinal integers\n    (``encoding='ordinal'``).\n    This encoding is needed for feeding categorical data to many scikit-learn\n    estimators, notably linear models and SVMs with the standard kernels.\n    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <preprocessing_categorical_features>`.\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    encoding : str, 'onehot', 'onehot-dense' or 'ordinal'\n        The type of encoding to use (default is 'onehot'):\n        - 'onehot': encode the features using a one-hot aka one-of-K scheme\n          (or also called 'dummy' encoding). This creates a binary column for\n          each category and returns a sparse matrix.\n        - 'onehot-dense': the same as 'onehot' but returns a dense array\n          instead of a sparse matrix.\n        - 'ordinal': encode the features as ordinal integers. This results in\n          a single column of integers (0 to n_categories - 1) per feature.\n    categories : 'auto' or a list of lists\/arrays of values.\n        Categories (unique values) per feature:\n        - 'auto' : Determine categories automatically from the training data.\n        - list : ``categories[i]`` holds the categories expected in the ith\n          column. The passed categories are sorted before encoding the data\n          (used categories can be found in the ``categories_`` attribute).\n    dtype : number type, default np.float64\n        Desired dtype of output.\n    handle_unknown : 'error' (default) or 'ignore'\n        Whether to raise an error or ignore if a unknown categorical feature is\n        present during transform (default is to raise). When this is parameter\n        is set to 'ignore' and an unknown category is encountered during\n        transform, the resulting one-hot encoded columns for this feature\n        will be all zeros.\n        Ignoring unknown categories is not supported for\n        ``encoding='ordinal'``.\n    Attributes\n    ----------\n    categories_ : list of arrays\n        The categories of each feature determined during fitting. When\n        categories were specified manually, this holds the sorted categories\n        (in order corresponding with output of `transform`).\n    Examples\n    --------\n    Given a dataset with three features and two samples, we let the encoder\n    find the maximum value per feature and transform the data to a binary\n    one-hot encoding.\n    >>> from sklearn.preprocessing import CategoricalEncoder\n    >>> enc = CategoricalEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore')\n    >>> enc.fit([[0, 0, 3], [1, 1, 0], [0, 2, 1], [1, 0, 2]])\n    ... # doctest: +ELLIPSIS\n    CategoricalEncoder(categories='auto', dtype=<...

Nevertheless, there are different variables that determine whether a marketing campaign will be successful or not. There are certain variables that we need to take into consideration when making a marketing campaign. <br>\n\n## The 4 Ps:\n1) Segment of the <b>Population:<\/b> To which segment of the population is the marketing campaign going to address and why?

What segment of the population should we address? Which instrument should we use to get our message out? (Ex: Telephones, Radio, TV, Social Media Etc.)<br><br>\n3) <b> Price:<\/b> What is the best price to offer to potential clients? (In the case of the bank's marketing campaign this is not necessary since the main interest for the bank is for potential clients to open depost accounts in order to make the operative activities of the bank to keep on running.)<br><br>\n4) <b> Promotional<\/b> Strategy: This is the way the strategy  is going to be implemented and how are potential clients going to be address. This should be the last part of the marketing campaign analysis since there has to be an indepth analysis of previous campaigns (If possible) in order to learn from previous mistakes and to determine how to make the marketing campaign much more effective.","ea98cb96":"# What Actions should the Bank Consider?\n<a id=\"bank_actions\"><\/a>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/l46Cy1rHbQ92uuLXa\/giphy.gif\">\n\n\n## Solutions for the Next Marketing Campaign (Conclusion):\n1) **Months of Marketing Activity:** We saw that the the month of highest level of marketing activity was the month of **May**. However, this was the month that potential clients tended to reject term deposits offers (Lowest effective rate: -34.49%). For the next marketing campaign, it will be wise for the bank to focus the marketing campaign during the months of **March, September, October and December.** (December should be under consideration because it was the month with the lowest marketing activity, there might be a reason why december is the lowest.)<br><br>\n2) **Seasonality:** Potential clients opted to suscribe term deposits during the seasons of **fall** and **winter**. The next marketing campaign should focus its activity throghout these seasons. <br><br>\n3) **Campaign Calls:** A policy should be implemented that states that no more than 3 calls should be applied to the same potential client in order to save time and effort in getting new potential clients. Remember, the more we call the same potential client, the likely he or she will decline to open a term deposit. <br><br>\n4) **Age Category:** The next marketing campaign of the bank should target potential clients in their 20s or younger and 60s or older. The youngest category had a 60% chance of suscribing to a term deposit while the eldest category had a 76% chance of suscribing to a term deposit. It will be great if for the next campaign the bank addressed these two categories and therefore, increase the likelihood of more term deposits suscriptions. <br><br>\n5) **Occupation:** Not surprisingly, potential clients that were students or retired were the most likely to suscribe to a term deposit. Retired individuals, tend to have more term deposits in order to gain some cash through interest payments. Remember, term deposits are short-term loans in which the individual (in this case the retired person) agrees not to withdraw the cash from the bank until a certain date agreed between the individual and the financial institution. After that time the individual gets its capital back and its interest made on the loan. Retired individuals tend to not spend bigly its cash so they are morelikely to put their cash to work by lending it to the financial institution. Students were the other group that used to suscribe term deposits.<br><br>\n6) **House Loans and Balances:** Potential clients in the low balance and no balance category were more likely to have a house loan than people in the average and high balance category. What does it mean to have a house loan? This means that the potential client has financial compromises to pay back its house loan and thus, there is no cash for he or she to suscribe to a term deposit account. However, we see that potential clients in the average and hih balances are less likely to have a house loan and therefore, more likely to open a term deposit. Lastly, the next marketing campaign should focus on individuals of average and high balances in order to increase the likelihood of suscribing to a term deposit. <br><br>\n\n7) **Develop a Questionaire during the Calls:** Since duration of the call is the feature that most positively correlates with whether a potential client will open a term deposit or not, by providing an interesting questionaire for potential clients during the calls the conversation length might increase. Of course, this does not assure us that the potential client will suscribe to a term deposit! Nevertheless, we don't loose anything by implementing a strategy that will increase the level of engagement of the potential client leading to an increase probability of suscribing to a term deposit, and therefore an increase in effectiveness for the next marketing campaign the bank will excecute. <br><br>\n\n8) <b>Target individuals with a higher duration (above 375): <\/b> Target the target group that is above average in duration, there is a highly likelihood that this target group would open a term deposit account. The likelihood that this group would open a term deposit account is at 78% which is pretty high. This would allow that the success rate of the next marketing campaign would be highly successful.<br><br>\n\nBy combining all these strategies and simplifying the market audience the next campaign should address, it is likely that the next marketing campaign of the bank will be more effective than the current one.\n\n\n\n\n","332e3776":"### Avoiding Overfitting:\nBrief Description of Overfitting?<br>\nThis is an error in the modeling algorithm that takes into consideration random noise in the fitting process rather than the pattern itself. You can see that this occurs when the model gets an awsome score in the training set but when we use the test set (Unknown data for the model) we get an awful score. This is likely to happen because of overfitting of the data (taking into consideration random noise in our pattern). What we want our model to do is to take the overall pattern of the data in order to correctly classify whether a potential client will suscribe to a term deposit or not. In the examples above, it is most likely that the Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest classifiers are overfitting since they both give us nearly perfect scores (100% and 99%) accuracy scores. <br><br>\n\n\nHow can we avoid Overfitting?<br>\nThe best alternative to avoid overfitting is to use cross validation. Taking the training test and splitting it. For instance, if we split it by 3, 2\/3 of the data or 66% will be used for training and 1\/3 33% will be used or testing and we will do the testing process three times. This algorithm will iterate through all the training and test sets and the main purpose of this is to grab the overall pattern of the data.","086f7603":"# Confusion Matrix: \n<a id=\"confusion\"><\/a>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/computersciencesource.files.wordpress.com\/2010\/01\/conmat.png\">\n\n## Insights of a Confusion Matrix: \nThe main purpose of a confusion matrix is to see how our model is performing when it comes to classifying potential clients that are likely to suscribe to a term deposit.
