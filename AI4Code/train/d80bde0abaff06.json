I know it's hard to read, but I just want you to notice these points:\n- Class 0 contains customers who don't make a lot of money (look at their `BALANCE`, it is the lowest of all) but this doen't keep them away from purchasing stuff! in terms of `PURCHASES`, they are the second class. how do they do this? take a closer look: they don't buy stuff in one go (they have lowest ammount of `ONEOFF_PURCHASES` and `ONEOFF PURCHASES FREQUENCY`) their key to success is _instalments!_ It's easy: if you don't make enough money to buy stuff in one go, just pay over a period of time. (They have highest values of `INSTALLMENTSPURCHASES` and `PURCHASESINSTALLMENTSFREQUENCY`  I refer to these people as **Dreamers** because although they don't make much money, lack of money doesn't prevent them from reaching for their dreams!\n- Class 1 shows customers who are not very rich, and don't take risks. their `BALANCE` (amount left in their account to make purchases) is below average, and they don't purchase much. (their `PURCHASES` is below average as well, and their `PURCHASE FREQUENCY` is very low.) I call these people **Economicals**. to them, every penny is important.\n- Class 2 contains customers who have a good income (second highest `BALANCE`) and are enjoying it! they purchase a lot (highest `PURCHASESFREQUENCY`), both in installments and in one-go. let's call them **Bourgeoisie**!\n- Class 3 is mysterious. look at them! they have highest `BALANCE`, but lowest `PURCHASE` of all! it seems they only use their fortunes when they want pay in advance (highest `CASHADVANCE`, `CASHADVANCEFREQUENCY` and `CASHADVANCETRX`). A cash advance is a service provided by most credit card and charge card issuers. The service allows cardholders to withdraw cash, either through an ATM or over the counter at a bank or other financial agency, up to a certain limit. For a credit card, this will be the credit limit (or some percentage of it). so, these guys don't use their credit cards to buy stuff, instead, they get chash from ATMs to do so. why? it is beause they want to buy something illegal?
