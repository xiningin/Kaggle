Lots of fun.  I had other plans for my morning' The selected text can be 'my boss was not happy w\/ them. Lots of fun' or 'Lots of fun' but cannot be 'Morning,vendor and my boss,\n* Thanks to this discussion:https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/tweet-sentiment-extraction\/discussion\/138520 We know that neutral tweets have a jaccard similarity of 97 percent between text and selected_text\n* Also as discussed here https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/tweet-sentiment-extraction\/discussion\/138272 ,there are rows where selected_text starts from between the words and thus selected_texts dont always make sense and since we do not know whether the output of test set contain these descrepancies or not ,we are not sure that preprocessing and removing punctuations would be a good idea or not","89caa263":"So the first two common word was I'm so I removed it and took data from second row","06452a43":"## It's Time For WordClouds\n\nWe will be building wordclouds in the following order:\n\n* WordCloud of Neutral Tweets\n* WordCloud of Positive Tweets\n* WordCloud of Negative Tweets\n","a9b3dd99":"#### Training models for Positive and Negative tweets","46f5bb28":"So We have 27486 tweets in the train set and 3535 tweets in the test set","c3880a96":"SO we can see the Most common words in Selected text and Text are almost the same,which was obvious","5078a656":"* The number of words plot is really interesting ,the tweets having number of words greater than 25 are very less and thus the number of words distribution plot is right skewed","c88f244b":"# EDA","d9e9b2ca":"Selected_text is a subset of text ","ed8c5901":"**For Full Understanding of the how to train spacy NER with custom inputs, please read the spacy documentation along with the code presentation in this notebook : https:\/\/spacy.io\/usage\/training#ner Follow along from Updating Spacy NER**","c480cd46":"## 1)Modelling the Problem as NER\n\nNamed Entity Recognition (NER) is a standard NLP problem which involves spotting named entities (people, places, organizations etc.) from a chunk of text, and classifying them into a predefined set of categories.\nFor understanding NER here is very good article : https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/named-entity-recognition-with-nltk-and-spacy-8c4a7d88e7da\n\nWe will be using spacy for creating our own customised NER model or models (seperate for each Sentiment).The motivation for this approach is off course the kernel shared by Rohit Singh,so if you find his kernel useful please upvote it.\n\nWhat will be different with my solution:\n* I will use text as selected_text for all neutral tweets due to their high jaccard similarity\n* Also I will use text as selected_text for all tweets having number of words less than 3 in text as explained before\n* I will train two different models for Positive and Negtive tweets\n* I will not preprocess the data because the selected text contains raw text","766b6989":"We have one null Value in the train , as the test field for value is NAN we will just remove it","5da37665":"**Below is a helper Function which generates random colors which can be used to give different colors to your plots.Feel free to use it**","39de8f65":"## Generating Meta-Features","d2590101":"### Cleaning the Corpus\nNow Before We Dive into extracting information out of words in text and selected text,let's first clean the data","9c42e66e":"OOPS!While we cleaned our dataset we didnt remove the stop words and hence we can see the most coomon word is 'to' .
