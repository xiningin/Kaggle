Evaluation of Pass Coverage Attributes <a id=\"2.3\"><\/a>\n\nThis section focuses on applying the EPA predictions from the previous section to evaluate defensive player skill for different pass coverage attributes. The figure below illustrates the portions of a play that correspond to each attribute we cover in this section.\n\n![](https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/jvenzor23\/DefensiveCoverageNet\/master\/src\/08_writeup\/images\/PassCoverageAttributeTimeline5.png)\n\n### 2.3.a. Tracking Metrics <a id=\"2.3.a\"><\/a>\n\nA defender's tracking EPS quantifies the extent to which a defender alters the predicted EPA at the time of a pass attempt based on their ability to cover their assigned receiver prior to a throw. Due to the complexity of zone coverage schemes, we only produce tracking metrics for defenders in man coverage.\n\nThree factors must be considered to fairly assign EPS values to defenders in terms of tracking ability:\n\n1. __The predicted pre-pass EPA of a target is not equivalent to the predicted EPA of the eventual pass attempt:__ If a defender blankets a receiver, the quarterback has other receiving options to throw to, causing the EPA of the pass attempt to be greater (on average) than the EPA of the blanketed route. Conversely, if a defender loses a route, it is possible the quarterback does not see the receiver and throws elsewhere, making the EPA of the pass attempt less than the EPA of the open route. The figure below quantifies this phenomenon by discretizing route EPAs at the time of a pass attempt into buckets, and averaging over the predicted EPA of the pass attempt. This estimates the function $f$ such that $$\\widehat{\\text{EPA}}^{PassAttempt} = f(\\text{EPA}^{Route})$$\n![](https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/jvenzor23\/DefensiveCoverageNet\/master\/src\/08_writeup\/images\/PlayerTrackingPhysics7.png)\n2. __Teams generate pressure on the quarterback with varying effectiveness__. Our metric for tracking EPS accounts for this by weighting each pre-throw EPA prediction by the overall likelihood of a throw occurring at that time, $P(T = t)$.\n3. __The average EPA prediction at the time of a pass attempt is positive__. Since plays in which a pass attempt occur exclude sacks, it is not surprising that the average EPA prediction at the time of a pass attempt is positive. The average EPA prediction of a play at the time of a pass attempt is found to be: \n$$ \\overline{\\text{EPA}}^{PassAttempt} = +0.23 $$\n\nSynthesizing the above three points, we estimate a defender's tracking EPS as follows: \n\nFor each defender $i$, let \n* $n_i$ be the number of routes defender $i$ defended in man coverage, \n* $n_{t, i}$ be the number of routes defender $i$ defended in man coverage that lasted at least $t$ seconds after the snap\n* $\\text{max}(t)_i$ be the longest time after the snap defender $i$ had to cover in man coverage. \n* $\\text{EPA}_{t,j}^{Route}$ be the predicted EPA value of the $j$th route that defender $i$ was covering in man coverage $t$ seconds after the snap and before a pass attempt\n\nThen we quantify tracking EPS per play according to equation (2.3.1) below, and the total tracking EPS, according to equation (2.3.2) below. \n\n![](https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/jvenzor23\/DefensiveCoverageNet\/master\/src\/08_writeup\/images\/TrackingEQNs2.png)\n\nWe also adjust each player's tracking EPS based on EPA accrued through penalties such as defensive holding or illegal contact. Example plays with predicted pre-pass EPAs of targets are provided in appendix [A.3](#A.3)\n\n### 2.3.b. Closing, Ball Skills, Tackling, and INT Return Metrics <a id=\"2.3.b\"><\/a>\n\nNext, we quantify the EPS by defenders resulting from closing, ball skills, tackling, and INT return attributes. We quantify each defender's EPS per attribute by analyzing the shifts in the predicted real-time  EPAs over segments of a play where a defender is assigned to the targeted receiver.\n\nMathematically, for each defender $i$, let:\n* $N^{Closing}_i$, $N^{BallSkills}_i$, $N^{Tackling}_i$ be the sets of plays in which defender $i$ is assigned to the targeted receiver at the time of the pass arrival, outcome, and completion respectively\n* $N^{INTreturns}_i$ be the set of plays in which defender $i$ makes an interception\n* $\\text{EPA}^{'PassAttempt}_{ij}, \\text{EPA}^{PassArrival}_{ij}, \\text{EPA}^{PassOutcome}_{ij}, $ and $ \\text{EPA}^{Play}_{ij} $ be the predicted EPA at the time of the pass attempt[<sup>6<\/sup>](#fn6)<a id=\"fn6r\"><\/a>, pass arrival, pass outcome, and play result of the $j$th play for defender $i$ respectively. \n\nThen: \n\n$$\n\\text{EPS}_i^{Closing} =  \\sum_{j \\in N^{Closing}_i}\\Big(\\text{EPA}_{ij}^{'PassAttempt} - \\text{EPA}_{ij}^{PassArrival}\\Big)\\tag{2.3.3} $$\n\n$$ \\text{EPS}_i^{BallSkills} =  \\sum_{j \\in N^{BallSkills}_i}\\Big(\\text{EPA}^{PassArrival}_{ij} - \\text{EPA}_{ij}^{PassOutcome}\\Big)\\tag{2.3.4} $$\n\n$$ \\text{EPS}_i^{Tackling} =  \\sum_{j \\in N^{Tackling}_i}\\Big(\\text{EPA}^{PassOutcome}_{ij} - \\text{EPA}^{Play}_{ij}\\Big)\\tag{2.3.5} $$\n\n$$ \\text{EPS}_i^{INTreturns} =  \\sum_{j \\in N^{INTreturns}_i}\\Big(\\text{EPA}^{PassOutcome}_{ij} - \\text{EPA}^{Play}_{ij}\\Big)\\tag{2.3.6} $$\n\nWe compute each of these metrics separately by coverage type, and identify pass interference penalties[<sup>7<\/sup>](#fn7)<a id=\"fn7r\"><\/a> and factor these into each player's defensive grade based on the EPA of each penalty. Example plays for closing, ball skills, and tackling plays are provided in [A.4](#A.4), [A.5](#A.5), and [A.6](#A.6) respectively.\n\n### 2.3.c. Ball Hawk Metrics <a id=\"2.3.c\"><\/a>\n\nThere are instances when a defender reads the quarterback and earns a pass breakup or interception on a pass targeted to a receiver the defender was not covering. We classify this skill as a player's \"ball hawk\" ability. An example ball hawk interception is shown in [A.7](#A.7).\n\nMathematically, for each defender $i$, let:\n* $N^{BallHawk}_i$ be the set of plays in which defender $i$ earns a pass breakup or interception when defender $i$ was not covering the targeted receiver at the time of the pass attempt or pass arrival.\n* $\\text{EPA}^{PassAttempt}_{ij}$ and $\\text{EPA}^{PassOutcome}_{ij}$ be the predicted EPAs at the time of the pass attempt and outcome for the $j$th play in which defender $i$ was not assigned to the targeted receiver\n\nThen: \n\n$$\n\\text{EPS}_i^{BallHawk} =  \\sum_{j \\in N^{BallHawk}_i}\\Big(\\text{EPA}_{ij}^{PassAttempt} - \\text{EPA}_{ij}^{PassOutcome}\\Big)\\tag{2.3.7} $$","48f92b16":"### A.6 Positive Tackling Example (Jalen Ramsey) <a id=\"A.6\"><\/a>\n\n<table>\n <tr>\n    <td> <img src=\"https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/jvenzor23\/DefensiveCoverageNet\/master\/src\/08_writeup\/NFL_videos\/tackling_good.gif\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 300px;\"\/> <\/td>\n    <td> <img src=\"https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/jvenzor23\/DefensiveCoverageNet\/master\/src\/08_writeup\/intermediates\/tackle_good_intermediate.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 500px;\"\/> <\/td>\n    <\/tr>\n<\/table>","30aba851":"## 3.2 Dashboard <a id=\"3.2\"><\/a>\n\nWhile the above plots only display the top 15 players in each category, we also deploy a dashboard through shinyapps.io that contains all pass coverage attribute scores for all players.

Methods <a id=\"2\"><\/a>\n\nIn [Section 2.1](#2.1), we classify the coverage type (man\/zone) of a pass defender by implementing an unsupervised clustering algorithm. Next, in [Section 2.2](#2.2), we produce real-time EPA predictions over the course of each play by training a series of deep learning models using player tracking derived features. Finally, in [Section 2.3](#2.3), we provide methods to quantify a defender's EPS across our pass coverage attributes using the real-time EPA predictions obtained in Section 2.2.\n\n## 2.1. Classifying Coverage Type and Assignment <a id=\"2.1\"><\/a>\n\n### Coverage Type\nTo classify the coverage type employed by a defender, we utilize gaussian mixture models to identify clusters corresponding to man and zone coverage, adapted from the paper by [Dutta et al.](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/pdf\/1906.11373.pdf). We augment the pass-coverage specific features fed to the mixture model to generalize the algorithm to classify coverage type for all positions. Additionally, we fit separate mixture models to classify coverage type for plays with pass attempts and a sacks[<sup>1<\/sup>](#fn1)<a id=\"fn1r\"><\/a>. \n\n### Coverage Assignments\nIn addition to determining the type of coverage employed by a defender, we also identify each defender's coverage assignment throughout the course of a play. If we identify a defender as playing man coverage, we assign them to the receiver whose motion most closely matches that of the defender over the course of the play[<sup>2<\/sup>](#fn2)<a id=\"fn2r\"><\/a>. \n\nFor zone coverage, a defender's coverage assignment can change throughout the course of a play! Hence, we say that for any time $t$ prior to the outcome of a pass attempt, defender $x$ is assigned to receiver $y$ at time $t$ if and only if:\n* Defender $x$ is the closest defender to receiver $y$ at time $t$\n*  Receiver $y$ is the closest offensive player to defender $x$ at time $t$\n\nTwo animated plays, complete with each defender's coverage type and assignment over time, are provided in appendix [A.1](#A.1)","b9677643":"# Appendix <a id=\"5\"><\/a>\n### A.1 Coverage Example <a id=\"A.1\"><\/a>\n\nAnimations of two separate plays tagged with our coverage classifications and assignments are provided below.

Real-Time EPA Predictions <a id=\"2.2\"><\/a>\n\nIn order to evaluate defender performance across different pass coverage attributes during a play, it is first necessary to predict the eventual EPA of the play at various key points during the course of the play. We focus on predicting EPA values at the following time groupings within a play (the targeted receiver is known at each time grouping):\n\n__<ins>Time Groupings<\/ins>__\n* __Time of Pass Attempt__: Identified by `event = pass_forward` in the tracking data.\n* __Time of Pass Arrival__: Identified by `event = pass_arrived` in the tracking data.\n* __Time of Pass Outcome__: Identified by `event = pass_outcome_caught` or `event = pass_outcome_interception` in the tracking data (incompletions are not modeled because this pass outcome results in the end of a play). \n\nAn illustration of our formulation for predicting these real-time EPA values at each of the above time groupings[<sup>3<\/sup>](#fn3) is provided below (where CNN stands for convolutional neural network). The function we use to convert yards gained or lost to EPA in (3) below is from an open source implementation of an EPA model[<sup>4<\/sup>](#fn4)<a id=\"fn4r\"><\/a> provided by the nflWAR package [here](https:\/\/github.com\/ryurko\/nflscrapR-models\/blob\/master\/R\/init_models\/init_ep_fg_models.R).\n\n![](https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/jvenzor23\/DefensiveCoverageNet\/master\/src\/08_writeup\/images\/EpaModelingFlowDiagram8.png)\n\n![](https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/jvenzor23\/DefensiveCoverageNet\/master\/src\/08_writeup\/images\/ModelEQNs3.png)\n\nEquation (2.2.1) uses the outputs of (1) - (3) above to compute the predicted EPA of a play prior to the result of a pass, and Equations (2.2.2)-(2.2.3) above use the outputs of (2)-(3) above to compute the predicted EPA of a play at the time of the pass result.\n\nThe pass coverage specific features we feed to the CNN models and the model structures we employ are inspired by the [winning solution](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/nfl-big-data-bowl-2020\/discussion\/119400) to the 2019-2020 Big Data Bowl. The pass coverage specific features we derived are described in appendix [A.2](#A.2). Information on the structure of each CNN model we employ can be found in the [GitHub repository](https:\/\/github.com\/jvenzor23\/DefensiveCoverageNet) for this submission. For each model, we filter out plays from the training data set with fumbles, penalties that impact the outcome of the play, or other disqualifying characteristics[<sup>5<\/sup>](#fn5)<a id=\"fn5r\"><\/a>. Additionally, we increase the number of available training plays by producing a mirrored version of each play in the training set. \n\nSummaries of each CNN model created for this submission are listed in the table below.\n\n![](https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/jvenzor23\/DefensiveCoverageNet\/master\/src\/08_writeup\/images\/TotalModelStats3.png)\n\nDue to the lack of sample size for plays with an interception, we predicted the expected return yardage of an interception using Model 5 above, by flipping each intercepted play to be from the perspective of the defense rather than the offense.\n\nConsider the example play shown below (the defense is shown in blue, and the targeted receiver in red). At each time stamp, we provide our EPA prediction, as well as other predicted variables. \n\n![](https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/jvenzor23\/DefensiveCoverageNet\/master\/src\/08_writeup\/images\/ScoredEPAsEx2_3.png)\n\nFor this play, our real-time predictions enable us to uncover that the positive EPA of the play was earned after the catch.\n\n\n### Predicted Pre-Pass EPA of Target\nWe can also predict the pre-pass EPA of a target to each eligible receiver at all times prior to a pass attempt by scoring these real-time data with our models trained at the time of a pass attempt. We begin predicting these pre-pass EPA values at 0.5 seconds after the time of a snap, to ensure the quarterback is able to throw the football at the times we are scoring. An example play scored with these pre-throw EPA predictions is provided below.\n\n![](https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/jvenzor23\/DefensiveCoverageNet\/master\/src\/08_writeup\/images\/TrackingEPAsEx4.gif)","a950e4b8":"### A.4 Closing EPAs Examples <a id=\"A.4\"><\/a>\n\n__Positive Closing Example__ (D.J.
