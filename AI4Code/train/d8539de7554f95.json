Virtual writing tutors and automated writing systems can leverage these algorithms while teachers may use them to reduce grading time.

I've no problem while working on it. If you guys don't understand the thing that I'll do in this notebook then please comment on this notebook.\n\n#### What else do you think you can try as part of this approach?\nWriting is a critical skill for success. However, less than a third of high school seniors are proficient writers, according to the National Assessment of Educational Progress. Unfortunately, low-income, Black, and Hispanic students fare even worse, with less than 15 percent demonstrating writing proficiency. One way to help students improve their writing is via automated feedback tools, which evaluate student writing and provide personalized feedback.","0d77ae03":"#### What are you trying to do in this notebook?\nIn this competition, I\u2019ll identify elements in student writing. More specifically, I will automatically segment texts and classify argumentative and rhetorical elements in essays written by 6th-12th grade students. I'll access to the largest dataset of student writing ever released in order to test your skills in natural language processing, a fast-growing area of data science.\n\n#### Why are you trying it?\nI'll make it easier for students to receive feedback on their writing and increase opportunities to improve writing outcomes. Virtual writing tutors and automated writing systems can leverage these algorithms while teachers may use them to reduce grading time. The open-sourced algorithms you come up with will allow any educational organization to better help young writers develop.\n\nMy task is to predict the human annotations. I will first need to segment each essay into discrete rhetorical and argumentative elements (i.e., discourse elements) and then classify each element as one of the following:\n\nLead - an introduction that begins with a statistic, a quotation, a description, or some other device to grab the reader\u2019s attention and point toward the thesis\n\nPosition - an opinion or conclusion on the main question\n\nClaim - a claim that supports the position\n\nCounterclaim - a claim that refutes another claim or gives an opposing reason to the position\n\nRebuttal - a claim that refutes a counterclaim\n\nEvidence - ideas or examples that support claims, counterclaims, or rebuttals.\n\nConcluding Statement - a concluding statement that restates the claims"}}
