The pattern is used to detect the substrings\n\nFor example, suppose you have a dataset of customer reviews about your restaurant. Say, you want to extract the emojis from the reviews because they are a good predictor os the sentiment of the review.\n\nTake another example, the artificial assistants such as Siri, Google Now use information retrieval to give you better results. When you ask them for any query or ask them to search for something interesting on the screen, they look for common patterns such as emails, phone numbers, place names, date and time and so on. This is because then the assitant can automatically make a booking or ask you to call the resturant to make a booking.\n\nRegular expressions are very powerful tool in text processing.
