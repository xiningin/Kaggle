There are many small things that can trip you up (like the order of the clauses), but it will start to feel natural once you've done it a few times. Here, you'll write queries using **GROUP BY** to answer questions from the Hacker News dataset.\n\nBefore you get started, run the following cell to set everything up:","c9711b68":"# Keep Going\n**[Click here](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/dansbecker\/order-by)** to move on and learn about the **ORDER BY** clause.","ed54f417":"For the solution, uncomment the line below."}}
