Because we\u2019re interested in accuracy, we\u2019ll set the memory_usage parameter to 'deep' to get an accurate number.","fdf9dc79":"In this notebook,I will demonstrating Python\u2019s efficient RAM memory usage **techniques** with pandas, how to reduce a dataframe\u2019s memory footprint by almost 90%!!!!\n\n## Technique 1: Free Memory using gc.collect() \n\nIn python notebook once a dataset loads into RAM it does not free on its own.So if you load a huge dataframe like above into pandas, and then make a copy of it and never use it again, that original dataframe will still be in RAM consuming memory which is same as other variables.Therefore we should adopt the habit of deleting dataframe when it is no longer in use to save memory.  \n\nFor example, suppose we create a dataframe by name `jigsaw_seqlen128_df1`, extract\/explore some features and got the insights of the data but later on never used it ,then  `jigsaw_seqlen128_df1` will be consuming space.So we need to explicitely delete it using 'del' command.Note that there is no variable dependency on this dataframe before deleting it. So even after doing so there may be some residual memory usage.\n\nThat's where the garbage collection module comes into effect. `import gc` at the beginning of your project, and then each time you want to clear up space put command `gc.collect()` .  \n\nIt also helps to run `gc.collect()` after multiple transformations\/functions\/copying etc...  as all the little references\/values accumulate.\n\nNow we loaded the dataframe it is evident that it is consuming memory.Now let us delete the dataframe and collect residual garbage using gc.collect() method","6fd94f50":"We can see here the difference between uint (unsigned integers) and int (signed integers). Both types have the same capacity for storage, but by only storing positive values, unsigned integers allow us to be more efficient with our storage of columns that only contain positive values.\n\n### Numeric Column Optimization using Subtypes\nWe can use the function pd.to_numeric() to downcast our numeric types. We\u2019ll use DataFrame.select_dtypes to select only the integer columns, then we\u2019ll optimize the types and compare the memory usage.","2bc82a85":"Now we can use the dictionary, along with a few parameters for the date to read in the data with the correct types in a few lines:","6c4d27cd":"Now let us sort the above list and print to check .....","4b812186":"**Finally let us see the outcome**","c022f6ed":"Now time for cleanup of unused list generated above and garbage collect.","7cd0002b":"You can see that each unique value has been assigned an integer, and that the underlying datatype for the column is now int8. This column doesn\u2019t have any missing values, but if it did, the category subtype handles missing values by setting them to -1.\n\nLastly, let\u2019s look at the memory usage for this column before and after converting to the category type.","2144a60b":"As you can see, apart from the fact that the type of the column has changed, the data looks exactly the same. Let\u2019s take a look under the hood at what\u2019s happening.\n\nIn the following code, we use the Series.cat.codes attribute to return the integer values the category type uses to represent each value.","d056de99":"# Technique 4: Random Row Selection\nThis is nothing but performing a **random sampling** of the data and make best use of it.\nFor this we can build a list of random rows by writing a function ","1aae6123":"We can see a drop from 145.13 to 34.47 megabytes in memory usage, which is a more than 75% reduction.

We will use the second column of our data set, rating.\n\nLooking at the table above. we can see that it only contains two unique values. We\u2019ll convert it to categorical by using the .astype() method.","dd61fb7f":"From the above analogy it is observed that the size of strings when stored in a pandas series are identical to their usage as separate strings in Python.\n\n### Object types optimization using categoricals\n\nPandas introduced Categoricals in version 0.15. The category type uses integer values under the hood to represent the values in a column, rather than the raw values. Pandas uses a separate mapping dictionary that maps the integer values to the raw ones. This arrangement is useful whenever a column contains a limited set of values. When we convert a column to the category dtype, pandas uses the most space efficient int subtype that can represent all of the unique values in a column.\n\nTo get an overview of where we might be able to use this type to reduce memory, let\u2019s take a look at the number of unique values of each of our object types.","1a0d11a4":"That method is not recommended, because we can easily overlook a variable that should be removed or remove a used variable by mistake.\n\nThe better method of avoiding memory leaks is doing data processing inside a function. It creates a new scope for the intermediate variables and removes them automatically when the interpreter exits the function:","ba3c4fc2":"Wow, we have really made some progress by memory reduction of around 50% !!! \n\nSo far, we have explored ways to reduce the memory footprint of an existing dataframe. By reading the dataframe in first and then iterating on ways to save memory, we were able to understand the amount of memory we can expect to save from each optimization better.\n\nHowever in practice we often won\u2019t have enough memory to represent all the values in a data set.\n\nSo the question is how do we apply memory-saving techniques when we can\u2019t even create the dataframe in the first place? Let's explore and find out.\n\nWe can specify the optimal column types when we read the data set in. The pandas.read_csv() function has a few different parameters that allow us to do this. The dtype parameter accepts a dictionary that has (string) column names as the keys and NumPy type objects as the values.\n\nFirst, we\u2019ll store the final types of every column in a dictionary with keys for column names","44d7478a":"We can see that we have 1902194  rows and 47 columns. Pandas has automatically detected types for us, with 41 numeric columns and 6 object columns. Object columns are used for strings or where a column contains mixed data types.\n\nSo we can get a better understanding of where we can reduce this memory usage, let\u2019s take a look into how Python and pandas store data in memory.\n\n\nEach type has a specialized class in the pandas.core.internals module. Pandas uses the ObjectBlock class to represent the block containing string columns, and the FloatBlock class to represent the block containing float columns. For blocks representing numeric values like integers and floats, pandas combines the columns and stores them as a NumPy ndarray. The NumPy ndarray is built around a C array, and the values are stored in a contiguous block of memory. Due to this storage scheme, accessing a slice of values is incredibly fast.\n\nBecause each data type is stored separately, we are going to examine the memory usage by data type. Let\u2019s start by looking at the average memory usage for data type.","14141632":"# Introduction\n![](https:\/\/translucentcomputing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/performance.png)\nWhile working in python jupyter notebooks using pandas with small datasets (100MB), performance degradation is not seen however when we work on large datasets (1 GB or above), performance issue of the notebook is clearly seen as it takes longer time for the cell to execute resulting in either longer execution time of the cell or the notebook failing due to insufficient memory.\n\nTools like Spark can handle large datasets (100's of GB to TB), taking full advantage of their capabilities usually requires more expensive hardware which is practically not possible while we try to work POC's or doing research. And unlike pandas, they lack rich feature sets for high quality data cleaning, exploration, and analysis. For medium-sized data, we\u2019re better off trying to get more out of pandas, rather than switching to a different tool.\n\n### Dataset\n\nI have choosen a existing kaggle dataset from competition data namely **Jigsaw Multilingual Toxic Comment Classification** which has sizable data to demonstrate what I am trying to convey in this notebook.\n\n#### Brief about the data:\n\nJigsaw's API, Perspective, serves toxicity models and others in a growing set of languages (see our documentation for the full list). Over the past year, the field has seen impressive multilingual capabilities from the latest model innovations, including few- and zero-shot learning. We're excited to learn whether these results \"translate\" (pun intended!) to toxicity classification. Your training data will be the English data provided for our previous two competitions and your test data will be Wikipedia talk page comments in several different languages.\n\nAs our computing resources and modeling capabilities grow, so does our potential to support healthy conversations across the globe. Develop strategies to build effective multilingual models and you'll help Conversation AI and the entire industry realize that potential.\n\n#### Files\n\n* jigsaw-toxic-comment-train.csv - data from our first competition. The dataset is made up of English comments from Wikipedia\u2019s talk page edits.\n* jigsaw-unintended-bias-train.csv - data from our second competition. This is an expanded version of the Civil Comments dataset with a range of additional labels.\n* sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format\n* test.csv - comments from Wikipedia talk pages in different non-English languages.\n* validation.csv - comments from Wikipedia talk pages in different non-English languages.\n* jigsaw-toxic-comment-train-processed-seqlen128.csv - training data preprocessed for BERT\n* jigsaw-unintended-bias-train-processed-seqlen128.csv - training data preprocessed for BERT\n* validation-processed-seqlen128.csv - validation data preprocessed for BERT\n* test-processed-seqlen128.csv - test data preprocessed for BERT\n\nLet\u2019s start by importing both pandas and our data in Python and taking a look at the first five rows.","787bc648":"# Technique 13: autoreload\nThe autoreload module is there to help with code structure.

We\u2019ll look at those later, but first lets see if we can improve on the memory usage for our numeric columns.\n\n### Deeper understanding of subtypes\n\nUnder the hood pandas represents numeric values as NumPy ndarrays and stores them in a continuous block of memory. This storage model consumes less space and allows us to access the values themselves quickly. Because pandas represents each value of the same type using the same number of bytes, and a NumPy ndarray stores the number of values, pandas can return the number of bytes a numeric column consumes quickly and accurately.\n\nMany types in pandas have multiple subtypes that can use fewer bytes to represent each value. For example, the float type has the float16, float32, and float64 subtypes. The number portion of a type\u2019s name indicates the number of bits that type uses to represent values. For example, the subtypes we just listed use 2, 4, 8 and 16 bytes, respectively.\n\nAn int8 value uses 1 byte (or 8 bits) to store a value, and can represent 256 values (2^8) in binary. This means that we can use this subtype to represent values ranging from -128 to 127 (including 0).\n\nWe can use the numpy.iinfo class to verify the minimum and maximum values for each integer subtype. Let\u2019s look at an example:","3f71644d":"Now we load the memory_profiler IPython extension","08ddcce8":"### There we go finally by optimizing the columns, we\u2019ve managed to reduce the memory usage in pandas from 4300 MB to 2320.70 MB \u2013 an impressive 55% reduction!\n\n# Technique 3: Import selective no of rows in data\n\nUsually by default we read a csv file as a whole but there is an option called nrows where we can specify no of rows to import .For example if we want to read a csv file with the first 2000 rows only then syntax is as follows ","dd4a38db":"Timer unit: 1e-06 s\n\nTotal time: 62.5456 s\nFile: <ipython-input-58-0f6e1f5ac99b>\nFunction: estimate_pi at line 3\n\nLine #      Hits         Time  Per Hit   % Time  Line Contents\n==============================================================\n     3                                           def estimate_pi(n=1e7) -> \"area\":\n     4                                               \"\"\"Estimate pi with monte carlo simulation.\n     5                                               \n     6                                               Arguments:\n     7                                                   n: number of simulations\n     8                                               \"\"\"\n     9         1          3.0      3.0      0.0      in_circle = 0\n    10         1          1.0      1.0      0.0      total = n\n    11                                               \n    12  10000001    9739317.0      1.0     15.6      while n != 0:\n    13  10000000   10079187.0      1.0     16.1          prec_x = random()\n    14  10000000    9900919.0      1.0     15.8          prec_y = random()\n    15  10000000   15220356.0      1.5     24.3          if pow(prec_x, 2) + pow(prec_y, 2) <= 1:\n    16   7855684    7664704.0      1.0     12.3              in_circle += 1 # inside the circle\n    17  10000000    9941136.0      1.0     15.9          n -= 1\n    18                                                   \n    19         1          3.0      3.0      0.0      return 4 * in_circle \/ total\n\nNotice the extensive time (24.3%) spent on the if statement on line 15. Take in mind that we can even colorize the report above, giving us a more intuitive way to see **hot-spots**.\n \n All we have to do is insert the %%heat command at the top of the cell (to use load the extension%load_ext heat after installing with !pip install py-heat-magic) and it allows us to see the completely red while loop obliquing high cost of CPU-time, clearly showing room for optimization.\n \n# Technique 12: Memory Profiler\nIn this technique, we will look at a simple **memory profiler** called memory_profiler. It is very similar to **line_profiler**, and it can be conveniently be used from IPython.The **memory_profiler** package checks the memory usage of the interpreter at every line. The increment column allows us to spot those places in the code where large amounts of memory are allocated. This is especially important when working with arrays. Unnecessary array creations and copies can considerably slow down a program. We will tackle this issue in the next few recipes.\n\nLet us install it first","606a4be6":"We can mention no of rows to skip by using the option of **\"skiprows\"** as shown below with heading.Note that if we  want to import the headings from the csv file we need to skip first rows but use the first row for heading:","3a6126a2":"# Technique 11: Line profiler\n\n**%lprun** command yields the time spent on each line of code giving us a line by line report.

Most of the gain will be observed while optimizing the object types.\n\nBefore we do, let\u2019s take a closer look at how strings are stored in pandas compared to the numeric types\n### Comparing String to Numeric storage\nThe object type represents values using Python string objects, partly due to the lack of support for missing string values in NumPy. Because Python is a high-level, interpreted language, it doesn\u2019t have fine grained-control over how values in memory are stored.\n\nThis limitation causes strings to be stored in a fragmented way that consumes more memory and is slower to access. Each element in an object column is really a pointer that contains the \u201caddress\u201d for the actual value\u2019s location in memory.\n\nBelow is a diagram showing how numeric data is stored in NumPy data types vs how strings are stored using Python\u2019s inbuilt types.\n\n![](https:\/\/www.dataquest.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/numpy_vs_python.png)\nAs you might have noticed by now that object types consume considerable amount of memory. While each pointer takes up 1 byte of memory, each actual string value uses the same amount of memory that string would use if stored individually in Python. Let\u2019s use sys.getsizeof() to prove that out, first by looking at individual strings, and then items in a pandas series.","d456a8d2":"Use this command to run the above function \n**%memit pi_calculation()**","18804a78":"### Generator Approach:\nNow let us look at how efficient generator approach ","8ea9e37f":"# Technique 8: Do not use + operator for strings\n\nStart avoiding + operator for concatenation for strings as they are immutable,i.e every time we add an element to a string, Python creates a new string and a new address which means** new memory** needs to be allocated each time the string is altered.\n\nLet us see with a simple example as shown below \n\n**Normal approach:**","aea03fd7":"So you may wonder what will happen if we call **next()** past the end. For this we have a built in exception type called **StopIteration** that automatically raises once the generator stops yielding.\n\nIn summary when we call a **generator** function or use a generator expression, we return a special iterator called a generator. We can assign this generator to a variable in order to use it. When we call special methods on the generator, such as next(), the code within the function is executed up to yield.\n\nLet us compare a normal approach vs using **generators** with respect to memory usage and time taken for the code to execute.\n\nSuppose we iterate through a large list of numbers 500000 and store the square of all the numbers which are even in a seperate list.\n\n### Normal Approach","afa97bab":"\n# Technique 14: Increase default memory limit size\n\nJupyter notebook has a default memory limit size. You can try to increase the memory limit by following the steps:\n\n**1) Generate Config file using command:**\n\n*jupyter notebook --generate-config*\n\n**2) Open jupyter_notebook_config.py file situated inside 'jupyter' folder and edit the following property:**\n\n*NotebookApp.max_buffer_size = your desired value*\n\nRemember to remove the '#' before the property value.\n\n**3) Save and run the jupyter notebook. It should now utilize the set memory value. Also, don't forget to run the notebook from inside the jupyter folder.**\n\nAlternatively, you can simply run the Notebook using below command:\n\n*jupyter notebook --NotebookApp.max_buffer_size=your_value*","27f27878":"# Technique 6: Use of Generators\nGenerators allow you to create a function that returns one item at a time rather than all the items at once. This means that if you have a large dataset, you don\u2019t have to wait for the entire dataset to be accessible.\n\nGenerator functions allow you to declare a function that behaves like an iterator. It allows us to make an iterator in a fast, easy, and clean way. An iterator is an object that can be iterated (looped) upon. It is used to abstract a container of data to make it behave like an iterable object. Some examples of common iterable objects are strings, lists and dictionaries.\n\nA generator looks a lot like a function, but uses the keyword **yield** instead of **return**. Let us take an example for better understanding. Suppose we try to generate numbers less than 10 using a generator by name \"number_generator\" as follows","7d06a673":"We can see that all our float columns were converted from float64 to float32, giving us a 50% reduction in memory usage.\n\nLet\u2019s create a copy of our original dataframe, assign these optimized numeric columns in place of the originals, and see what our overall memory usage is now.","bd4f13e0":"The advantage lies in the fact that generators don\u2019t store all results in memory, rather they generate them on the fly, hence the memory is only used when we ask for the result. Also generators abstract away much of the boilerplate code needed when writing iterators, hence also helps in reducing the size of code.\n# Technique 7: Eliminate unneccessary loops by using itertools\n**itertools** saves you a lot of time on loops. It also gets rid of the complexity of the code.This module implements a number of iterator building blocks.\n\n### Itertool functions\n\nI will demostrating some of the itertool functions in this notebook .They provide streams of infinite length, so they should only be accessed by functions or loops that truncate the stream.\n\n**itertools.accumulate(iterable[, func, *, initial=None])**\n\nThis iterator returns accumulated sums, or accumulated results of other binary functions (specified via the optional func argument).If func is supplied, it should be a function of two arguments. Elements of the input iterable may be any type that can be accepted as arguments to func.\n\nUsually, the number of elements output matches the input iterable. However, if the keyword argument initial is provided, the accumulation leads off with the initial value so that the output has one more element than the input iterable.\n\nLet us see an example to see how it works","b1e062b2":" # Technique 10: Memory leaks\n \n We can avoid memory leaks in Jupyter Notebook by removing the temporary variables when we no longer need them.","4bc0098a":"Now let us see how we can maximum values using the accumulate()","292f09ad":"We\u2019ve gone from 117.91MB of memory usage to 1.81MB of memory usage, or a 99% reduction!

The biggest one is the inability to perform numerical computations. We can\u2019t do arithmetic with category columns or use methods like Series.min() and Series.max() without converting to a true numeric dtype first.\n\n**We should stick to using the category type primarily for object columns where less than 50% of the values are unique.** If all of the values in a column are unique, the category type will end up using more memory. That\u2019s because the column is storing all of the raw string values in addition to the integer category codes. You can read more about the limitations of the category type in the pandas documentation.\n\nWe\u2019ll write a loop to iterate over each object column, check if the number of unique values is less than 50%, and if so, convert it to the category type."}}
