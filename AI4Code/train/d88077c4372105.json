In this way, the farmers make their different products available to the company, and the start-up is responsible for meeting the demand needs by distributing the products to end customers in the city.\n\nTo improve the logistics management and develop this work in a efficient way, the start-up owners have seen the need of design and implement a management and prediction system that allows them to plan the expected demand with due anticipation. So they could coordinate the production activities with the farmers, and meet the demand while minimizing the losses fot units of product not sold or damaged.\n\nThus, the agricultural start-up must manage the stock in a smart way, decreasing the time window between harvest and consumtion. To do this, needs develop demanda prediction models that support its operation. archieving the availability of products to meet the needs of customers of the following day, minimizing food waste and identifying consumption habits that allows them to optimize their logistics operations and busisness.\n\nIn this Notebook we just start with a first perception about data that let us work with the data ina better way later."}}
