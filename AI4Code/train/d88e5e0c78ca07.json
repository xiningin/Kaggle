strong correlation between 'GDP' and 'total vaccinations'. This result is obvious as we can see the countries with high GDP are the ones leading in total vaccination effort.  \n\nThere is a fairly good correlation between 'population' and 'total vaccinations'. Countries with higher population are definitely trying hard to administer more vaccines to more people because. \n\nAlso we can see that there is small correlation between \"Health: Total expenditure\" and 'total vaccinations', but it is not very strong. \n","81a8f6a9":"As we can observe from the above, there are many columns with minimum values of -99.
