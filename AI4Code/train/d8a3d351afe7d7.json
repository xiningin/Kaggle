Such wors are 'room', 'bedroom', 'private', 'apartment', 'studio'. This shows that there are no catchphrases or 'popular\/trending' terms that are used for names; hosts use very simple terms describing the space and the area where the listing is. This technique was somewhat expected as dealing with multilingual customers can be tricky and you definitely want to describe your space in a concise and understood form as much as possible.","492002c5":"### Conclusion\n\n##### _Summarizing our findings, suggesting other features_","b2b61934":"Great, with a statistical table and a violin plot we can definitely observe a couple of things about distribution of prices for Airbnb in NYC boroughs. First, we can state that Manhattan has the highest range of prices for the listings with \\\\$150 price as average observation, followed by Brooklyn with \\\\$90 per night. Queens and Staten Island appear to have very similar distributions, Bronx is the cheapest of them all. This distribution and density of prices were completely expected; for example, as it is no secret that Manhattan is one of the most expensive places in the world to live in, where Bronx on other hand appears to have lower standards of living.","85ea5eeb":"### Abstract \n\n##### _Abstract overview of the notebook_","91c6f676":"Interesting, we can see that there is a good distribution between top 10 hosts with the most listings. First host has more than 300+ listings.","fe1df52e":"Now that we are ready for an exploration of our data, we can make a rule that we are going to be working from left to right. The reason some may prefer to do this is due to its set approach - some datasets have a big number of attributes, plus this way we will remember to explore each column individually to make sure we learn as much as we can about our dataset.","7e5b8fdc":"### Acquaring and Loading Data\n\n##### _Presenting the code and methods for acquiring the data. Loading the data into appropriate format for analysis. Explaining the process and results_","97f6e955":"Amazing, but let' breakdown on what we can see from this plot. First, we can see that our plot consists of 3 subplots - that is the power of using catplot; with such output, we can easily proceed with comparing distributions among interesting attributes. Y and X axes stay exactly the same for each subplot, Y-axis represents a count of observations and X-axis observations we want to count. However, there are 2 more important elements: column and hue; those 2 differentiate subplots. After we specify the column and determined hue we are able to observe and compare our Y and X axes among specified column as well as color-coded. So, what do we learn from this? The observation that is definitely contrasted the most is that 'Shared room' type Airbnb listing is barely available among 10 most listing-populated neighborhoods. Then, we can see that for these 10 neighborhoods only 2 boroughs are represented: Manhattan and Brooklyn; that was somewhat expected as Manhattan and Brooklyn are one of the most traveled destinations, therefore would have the most listing availability. We can also observe that Bedford-Stuyvesant and Williamsburg are the most popular for Manhattan borough, and Harlem for Brooklyn.","b2640422":"Fantastic! After scaling our image the best we can, we observe that we end up with a very immersive heatmap. Using latitude and longitude points were able to visualize all NYC listings. Also, we added a color-coded range for each point on the map based on the price of the listing. However, it is important to note that we had to drop some extremely high values as they are treated as outliers for our analysis. ","8a3f31d4":"This dataset has around 49,000 observations in it with 16 columns and it is a mix between categorical and numeric values.","e6e00328":"Please note that we are dropping'host_name' not only because it is insignificant but also for ethical reasons. There should be no reasoning to continue data exploration and model training (which we will be doing later) towards specific individuals based on their names. Why is that? Those names are assigned to actual humans, also they present no security threat or military\/governmental interest based on the nature of the dataset, therefore names are unimportant to us.","3aece196":"Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on traveling possibilities and present a more unique, personalized way of experiencing the world. Today, Airbnb became one of a kind service that is used and recognized by the whole world. Data analysis on millions of listings provided through Airbnb is a crucial factor for the company. These millions of listings generate a lot of data - data that can be analyzed and used for security, business decisions, understanding of customers' and providers' (hosts) behavior and performance on the platform, guiding marketing initiatives, implementation of innovative additional services and much more.","3aa7bc15":"There is no reason to visualize this as table format would be the most suitable output for better reading. From this table output, we can observe that top 10 most reviewed listings on Airbnb for NYC has price average of \\\\$65 with most of the listings under \\\\$50, and 9\/10 of them are 'Private room' type; top reviewed listing has 629 reviews.","9f512b77":"After loading the dataset in and from the head of AB_2019_NYC dataset we can see a number of things. These 16 columns provide a very rich amount of information for deep data exploration we can do on this dataset. We do already see some missing values, which will require cleaning and handling of NaN values. Later, we may need to continue with mapping certain values to ones and zeros for predictive analytics.","e2631bc7":"### Exploring and Visualizing Data\n\n##### Exploring the data by analyzing its statistics and visualizing the values of features and correlations between different features.

First, we have found hosts that take good advantage of the Airbnb platform and provide the most listings; we found that our top host has 327 listings. After that, we proceeded with analyzing boroughs and neighborhood listing densities and what areas were more popular than another. Next, we put good use of our latitude and longitude columns and used to create a geographical heatmap color-coded by the price of listings. Further, we came back to the first column with name strings and had to do a bit more coding to parse each title and analyze existing trends on how listings are named as well as what was the count for the most used words by hosts. Lastly, we found the most reviewed listings and analyzed some additional attributes. For our data exploration purposes, it also would be nice to have couple additional features, such as positive and negative numeric (0-5 stars) reviews or 0-5 star average review for each listing; addition of these features would help to determine the best-reviewed hosts for NYC along with 'number_of_review' column that is provided. Overall, we discovered a very good number of interesting relationships between features and explained each step of the process. This data analytics is very much mimicked on a higher level on Airbnb Data\/Machine Learning team for better business decisions, control over the platform, marketing initiatives, implementation of new features and much more. Therefore, I hope this kernel helps everyone! ","76de6c92":"Good, scatterplot worked just fine to output our latitude and longitude points. However, it would be nice to have a map bellow for fully immersive heatmap in ourcase - let's see what we can do!","fbce6f9e":"In our case, missing data that is observed does not need too much special treatment. Looking into the nature of our dataset we can state further things: columns \"name\" and \"host_name\" are irrelevant and insignificant to our data analysis, columns \"last_review\" and \"review_per_month\" need very simple handling. To elaborate, \"last_review\" is date; if there were no reviews for the listing - date simply will not exist. In our case, this column is irrelevant and insignificant therefore appending those values is not needed. For \"review_per_month\" column we can simply append it with 0.0 for missing values; we can see that in \"number_of_review\" that column will have a 0, therefore following this logic with 0 total reviews there will be 0.0 rate of reviews per month. Therefore, let's proceed with removing columns that are not important and handling of missing data.","649d06dc":"Understanding unique values and categorical data that we have in our dataset was the last step we had to do. It looks like for those columns' values we will be doing some mapping to prepare the dataset for predictive analysis."}}
