Yes it is on the similar lines of older competition [here](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/human-protein-atlas-image-classification)\n\nWe shall soon understand the difference between older competition and the current one.\n\nBefore which, we shall understand what are presented to us as images in this competition data-set","c1ac5de1":"#### Label column has values seperated with pipe operator and each number in it represents a Label_Id - which maps to a Label_Value, We shall in a moment understand what these Label_Id and Label_Value are.\n\n#### Work in progress"}}
