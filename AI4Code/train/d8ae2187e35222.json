It started as an app store for Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 as the primary means of distributing Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps. With Windows 10, Microsoft merged its other distribution platforms (Windows Marketplace, Windows Phone Store, Xbox Music, Xbox Video, Xbox Store, and a web storefront also known as \"Microsoft Store\") into Microsoft Store, making it a unified distribution point for apps, console games, and digital videos. Digital music was included until the end of 2017, and E-books were included until 2019.[1] Some content is available free of charge from the store.\n\n# In 2015, over 669,000 apps were available on the store. Categories containing the largest number of apps are \"Books and Reference\", \"Education\", \"Entertainment\", and \"Games\". The majority of the app developers have one app.\n\n# As with other similar platforms, such as the Google Play and Mac App Store","7fae1da7":"# Most of Music Apps are free to use.
