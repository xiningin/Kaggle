First of all **what is Data Visualization ?**\n   **Data Visualization** is the representation of data or information in a graph, chart, or other visual format. It communicates relationships of the data with images. It allows trends and patterns to be more easily seen. It make Machine algorithm easy to understand. Data visualization is not only help for data scientists and data analysts it help in the  finance, marketing, tech, design, or anything. you need to visualize data.","e8b846ad":"**Pie Chart:-** Pie Chart can only display one series of data. Pie charts show the size of items in one data series, proportional to the sum of the items. The data points in a pie chart are shown as a percentage of the whole pie","afa17fa5":"There are more library flies liks seaborn,and plotly. Seaborn aims to make visualization a central part of exploring and understanding data. Its dataset-oriented plotting functions operate on dataframes and arrays containing whole datasets and internally perform the necessary semantic mapping and statistical aggregation to produce informative plots.Seaborn is a library for making statistical graphics in Python. It is built on top of matplotlib and closely integrated with pandas data structures.\nWe have various type of visualization in the both seaborn and matplotlib.","a2835cfb":"**Bar chart:-** Bar graph is a chart or graph that presents categorical data with rectangular bars with heights or lengths proportional to the values that they represent and they can be plotted vertically or horizontally.","f658171c":"First we work on the **matpoltlib.pyplot** in which we draw line chart,pie chart,histogram.Matplotlib is a multi-platform data visualization library built on NumPy arrays and designed to work with the broader SciPy stack. It was introduced by John Hunter in the year 2002.\n\nIf you have a later version of Python installed, you should be able to open cmd.exe\/terminal and then run:\n\npip install matplotlib","dd0562ed":"**Histogram Plot:-** A histogram is an accurate representation of the distribution of numerical data. It is an estimate of the probability distribution of a continuous variable.  \nwe plot histogram with the data set \"nba.csv\".","6fd9f248":"# Data Visualization in Python:- By matplotlib.pyplot","a7687fd5":"**Line chart**","6f53821a":"![pie1.jpg](attachment:pie1.jpg)","409bb2c1":"[Priyanshu Laod](https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/priyanshu-lasod-544438149)"}}
