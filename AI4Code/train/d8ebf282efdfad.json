However, often we want to group our data, and then do something specific to the group the data is in. We do this with the `groupby` operation.\n\nIn these exercises we'll apply groupwise analysis to our dataset.\n\n# Relevant Resources\n- [**Grouping Reference and Examples**](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/residentmario\/grouping-and-sorting-reference)  \n- [Pandas cheat sheet](https:\/\/github.com\/pandas-dev\/pandas\/blob\/master\/doc\/cheatsheet\/Pandas_Cheat_Sheet.pdf)","5c632ac2":"# Exercises","29f9ed3b":"## 6.\nWhat combination of countries and varieties are most common? Create a `Series` whose index is a `MultiIndex`of `{country, variety}` pairs. For example, a pinot noir produced in the US should map to `{\"US\", \"Pinot Noir\"}`. Sort the values in the `Series` in descending order based on wine count."}}
