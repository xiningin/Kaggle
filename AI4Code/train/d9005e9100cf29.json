For Example, apparently the median price of diamonds is higher for lower quality cuts, colors, and clarity.   \nIs that true or can we explain this phenomenon with the data. First at all lets take a look.","6161d362":"Let's see the residuals, remember that a linear regression can be evaluated if the sparse of the residuals is uniform.","b7af67b1":"It seems like a exponential growing, and we observe that most of the data are from carat lower than 2.5.   \nLet's make a couple of tweas to the dataset in order to make it easier to work with.   \n\n1.

So I take back my \"R for Data Science\" book and read again the modeling chapter, and this time I found new insights about. A model can be used for data processing like a filter that you can train to make your data more understandable. I hope you can read it and reproduce the diamonds example.
