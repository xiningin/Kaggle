Let\u2019s add some edges as well! We can add edges by calling add_edges() method of the Graph class using the object g - but in order to add edges, we have to refer to existing vertices somehow. igraph uses integer vertex IDs starting from zero, thus the first vertex of your graph has index zero, the second vertex has index 1 and so on. Edges are specified by pairs of integers, so [(0,1), (1,2)] denotes a list of two edges: one between the first and the second, and the other one between the second and the third vertices of the graph. Passing this list to add_edges() method adds these two edges to our graph:","11cfc0c7":"Now we can see some additional information in summary:\n\n* D or U, for a directed or undirected graph\n* N for a named graph (where nodes have a name attribute)\n* W for a weighted graph (where edges have a weight attribute)\n* B for a bipartite (two-mode) graph (where nodes have a type attribute)\n\nThe two numbers that follow (7 9) refer to the number of nodes and edges in the graph.

If you try to use vs or es as a Python dictionary, you will manipulate the attribute storage area of the graph:","3365aeab":"Note: Edges also have IDs, similarly to vertices; they also start from zero and edges that were added later have higher IDs than edges that were added earlier.

Moreover, if we| delete a vertex, even the vertex IDs will change.","58a5f0e3":"### 2. **Edge list:** An edge list is a data structure used to represent a graph as a list of its edges.
