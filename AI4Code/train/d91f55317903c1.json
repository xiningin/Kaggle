There's just one last implementational detail you have to know. There're a few ways of representing boxes, such as via their corners or via their midpoint and height\/width. YOLO converts between a few such formats at different times, using the following functions (which we have provided): \n\n```python\nboxes = yolo_boxes_to_corners(box_xy, box_wh) \n```\nwhich converts the yolo box coordinates (x,y,w,h) to box corners' coordinates (x1, y1, x2, y2) to fit the input of `yolo_filter_boxes`\n```python\nboxes = scale_boxes(boxes, image_shape)\n```\nYOLO's network was trained to run on 608x608 images. If you are testing this data on a different size image--for example, the car detection dataset had 720x1280 images--this step rescales the boxes so that they can be plotted on top of the original 720x1280 image.  \n\nDon't worry about these two functions; we'll show you where they need to be called.

Specifically: \n    - Score thresholding on the probability of detecting a class to keep only accurate (high probability) boxes\n    - Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholding to eliminate overlapping boxes\n- Because training a YOLO model from randomly initialized weights is non-trivial and requires a large dataset as well as lot of computation, we used previously trained model parameters in this exercise.
