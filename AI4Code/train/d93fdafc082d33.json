Thus we took a closer look at the PCA result and found that in component 1, rating for ambiance and the rating for service have higher influence in the feature, and rating for how much customer's decision depend on promotion have very little influence on the component, so we may inference that the customers could potentially be separated based on how muuch they rate the ambiance of Starbuck stores and the rate for the services starbuck provides. ","f4500994":"The accuracy is 78% which is quite decent, however provided that promotion rating and wifi rating are found to be not very significant in our previous output result,  we might want to try running the model again removing the two variables","70d10671":"From this plot we can see that using the elbow method, using 2-4 clusters are most suitable and in this case because we only have 6 regressors we might choose to use 3 cluster.","cb3c5e86":"we will clear the coolumns that do not contribute to analysis of customer behavior and change the header for each column first\n","d03181eb":"We can see that average price rating is 3, comparing with other coffee retailers rating is 3.6, wifi rating is 3.2, rating for ambiance is 3.7 and service rating is 3.7.\nOverall the rating performance is quite decent, we can examine how closely correlated each rating is with if the customer is going to visit again, but first transform the loyalty column to 1 and 0, with 1 indicating will visit again and 0 indicating will not.\n","c70994c3":"The accuracy of prediction did not change, which proves that customer's attention to promotion and their rating for wifi services are not very significant in determining their next visit, and that our model could well predict whether a customer will visit Starbucks again based on their rating to Starbucks's price, ambiance, service and rating comparing to other coffee retailers.","cae045f4":"there is a weak correlation between amount spent and age,indicating that as age increases amount spent increases, however the correlation is not very significant, however this only measures the linear correlation, whereas intuitively we might expect people around the middle age groups (20-29 and 30-39) to spend more in Starbucks, so it might be useful to look at their relationship from plots  ","0031496d":"Now let's look at age, status and income factors\n","8f580ee6":"How I would like to see which of these three factors have most influence on the frenquency of purchase and amount spent each time","71dbc6c3":"If we want to segment our customers based on the current rating figures we have, we might try to proceed with first PCA analysis then k means clustering:   ","87917c75":"In this project I will explore a dataset on Starbuck's Malaysia customer survey, analyse some main features and findings,predict whether customers will visit Starbucks again using the ratings and use a Kemans clustering algorithm to study the dataset and segment customers into groups.\n","39c174c2":"With the large F statistic we can infer that there is at least one variable that is significant, and we can see from the summary that the P value for age is 0.009 which pass a 10% level significant test, wiht confident interval of 0.089 to 0.529. Thus, although most of Starbuck's customer are between age of 20-30, the customers that spend larger amount are actually the group above 40. \n","9cb0bbb6":"we can see that the highest price rating is highly correlated, followed by comparsion rating with other coffee sellers, wifi and service rating followed a surprisingly negative linear correlation, this may show the pricing strategy is starbucks will be very crucial and that Starbucks should continue to strengthen it's competitive advantage in order to gain more support from customers. While pricing is particularly important, its average rating is lowest among all rating variables, thus Starbucks may need to reconsider its pricing strategy and its focus. \n","a2906860":"we can see that most of its customers come from age group of 20-29, mostly employed and have income less than RM 25,000.
