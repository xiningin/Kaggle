After graphing the regression line on the scatterplot with y on the horizontal axis and x on the vertical axis, the slope does look reasonable.

The predictors that appear to have a statistically significant relationship to the response `mpg` are `displacement` with a p-value of 0.001863, and `weight`, `year`, `originEuropean`, and `originJapanese` with p-values of essentially zero. The coefficients for `cylinders`, `horsepower`, and `acceleration` have p-values which are not small enough to provide evidence of a statistically significant relationship to the response `mpg`. The coefficient of 0.777 for the `year` variable suggests that when we fix the number of engine cylinders, engine displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, and country of origin, fuel efficiency increases on average by about 0.777 miles per gallon each year. In other words, the model suggests that we would expect cars from 1971 to be more fuel efficient by 0.777 miles per gallon on average compared to equivalent cars from 1970. Also of interest are the coefficients for `originEuropean` and `originJapanese`, which suggest that compared to equivalent cars from the United States, we would expect European cars to be more fuel efficient by 2.630 miles per gallon on average, and Japanese cars to be more fuel efficient by 2.853 miles per gallon on average.

Moreover, the cubic model has an $R^2$ value of 0.3689, which is a modest increase from the value of 0.3396 in the linear model.

This is important because even though orthogonalizing the polynomials doesn't affect overall predictions the model will give, it reduces the correlation between the various powers of $X$ at the cost of sacrificing coefficient interpretability. Reducing the correlation between the powers improves our ability to interpret the t-statistics for each coeffiecient, because it alleviates the issue of multicollinearity. Since the PolynomialFeatures transformer in scikit-learn generates raw polynomials, we add an extra the orthogonalization step in order to better evaluate whether or not the inclusion of non-linear terms improves the model fit.","634b888e":"## Part 3\n**What is the relationship between the results obtained in Part 1 and Part 2?**","a0b15685":"For the model involving both `x1` and `x2`, adding the new observation, while not really affecting the value of $\\hat{\\beta}_0$, had a large effect on the values of $\\hat{\\beta}_1$ and $\\hat{\\beta}_2$.

On top of $\\hat{\\beta}_1$ being cut down to a third and $\\hat{\\beta}_2$ being multiplied by a factor of about 1.5 of their values from Part 3, there is now no even less evidence to reject the null hypothesis $H_0: \\beta_1 = 0$ while there is even stronger evidence to reject the null hypothesis $H_0: \\beta_2 = 0$ (enough to reject at the 0.1% level). In this model, the new observation has a studentized residual of 1.3054. This falls short of our threshold of 3 to strongly consider the value an outlier, but it is still a moderate value and is certainly large enough to have decent influence on the model. The leverage value of this new observation is 0.4092, which is quite high compared to the average value of $(p + 1)\/n = 3\/101 = 0.0297$. Thus, I would consider the new observation to be one with high leverage and also a moderate studentized residual (though not large enough to be strongly considered an outlier).","5e4d381b":"After fitting a least squares regression to predict `y` using `x1` and `x2`, we get a model of the form $\\hat{Y} = 2.1893 + 0.7406X_1 + 2.5024X_2$. In other words, $\\hat{\\beta}_0 = 2.1893$, $\\hat{\\beta}_1 = 0.7406$, and $\\hat{\\beta}_2 = 2.5024$. While $\\hat{\\beta}_0$ is a fairly reasonable estimate for the true value of $\\beta_0 = 2$, the estimates for the other coefficient values are quite poor. The value of $\\hat{\\beta}_1$ less than half of the true value of $\\beta_1$, while the value of $\\hat{\\beta}_2$ is even further off, being more than eight times true value of $\\beta_2$. With a p-value of 0.2712 for $\\hat{\\beta}_1$, we don't have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis $H_0: \\beta_1 = 0$.

In addition, the $R^2$ value of 0.0402 indicates that about 4% of the variation in `CRIM` is explained by this simple linear regression model.","ac7d7cac":"In a simple linear regression of `CRIM` onto `PTRATIO`, the p-value for the estimated coefficient of `PTRATIO` is essentially zero. This means there is strong evidence of a statistically significant association between the predictor `PTRATIO` and the response `CRIM`. In addition, the $R^2$ value of 0.0841 indicates that about 8% of the variation in `CRIM` is explained by this simple linear regression model.","423c9c4a":"In a simple linear regression of `CRIM` onto `TAX`, the p-value for the estimated coefficient of `TAX` is essentially zero. This means there is strong evidence of a statistically significant association between the predictor `TAX` and the response `CRIM`. In addition, the $R^2$ value of 0.3396 indicates that about 34% of the variation in `CRIM` is explained by this simple linear regression model.","ac4c875c":"When fitting a multiple regression model to predict `CRIM` using all of the predictors, the (adjusted) $R^2$ value is 0.4394. This is an increase from the largest $R^2$ value among all of the individual simple linear regression models, which was 0.3913. That means that the model using all of the predictors does a better job of explaining the variation in `CRIM` values compared to any of the simple linear regression models. In this model, there are fewer predictors for which we have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis $H_0: \\beta_j = 0$, and this also depends on the significance level we wish to use. Only `RAD`, with a p-value of essentially zero, has very strong evidence to reject that null hypothesis. There is also strong evidence to do so for `DIS`, since its p-value is 0.00048. Next, we can reject the null hypothesis for `CMEDV` at the 1% level, but not at the 0.1% level, since its p-value is 0.00119. After that, we can fairly confidently reject the null hypothesis for `ZN` at the 5% level, with a p-value of 0.01643. We can also reject the null hypothesis for `B` at the 5% level, though it is a slightly borderline case with a p-value of 0.04027. `NOX` is also a borderline case with a p-value of 0.05119, which is only enough to reject the null hypothesis at the 10% level. However, that value is close enough to 0.05 that it would merit further investigation in order to more confidently make a decision in one direction or the other.","38ce0063":"In a simple linear regression of `CRIM` onto `RAD`, the p-value for the estimated coefficient of `RAD` is essentially zero. This means there is strong evidence of a statistically significant association between the predictor `RAD` and the response `CRIM`. In addition, the $R^2$ value of 0.3913 indicates that about 39% of the variation in `CRIM` is explained by this simple linear regression model.","134f998a":"## Part 4\n**Is there evidence of a non-linear association between any of the predictors and the response? To answer this question, for each predictor $X$, fit a model of the form**\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X + \\beta_2X^2 + \\beta_3X^3 + \\epsilon.\n\\end{equation}","e3315a9b":"The least squares regression model to predict `y` using `x` has the form $\\hat{Y} = -0.9969 + 0.4897X$, which is again is quite close to the true relationship $Y = -1 + 0.5X + \\epsilon$. The p-values of essentially zero for $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ provide strong evidence to reject the null hypotheses $H_0: \\beta_j = 0$ for $j = 1, 2$. We also note that now $R^2 = 0.7488$, which means that the linear regression model explains about 75% of the variation in $Y$ found in the less noisy data. This is a big improvement from the $R^2$ value of 0.5218 when using the original, noisier $Y$. In addition, the residual standard error value of 0.2536 is also an improvement over the value of 0.4688 from the original data."}}
