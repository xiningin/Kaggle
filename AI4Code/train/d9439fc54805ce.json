Introduction + Set-up\n\nMachine learning has a phenomenal range of applications, including in health and diagnostics. This tutorial will explain the complete pipeline from loading data to predicting results, and it will explain how to build an X-ray image classification model from scratch to predict whether an X-ray scan shows presence of pneumonia. This is especially useful during these current times as COVID-19 is known to cause pneumonia.\n\nThis tutorial will explain how to utilize TPUs efficiently, load in image data, build and train a convolution neural network, finetune and regularize the model, and predict results. Data augmentation is not included in the model because X-ray scans are only taken in a specific orientation, and variations such as flips and rotations will not exist in real X-ray images. For a tutorial on image data augmentation, check out this [tutorial](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/amyjang\/tensorflow-data-augmentation-efficientnet).\n\nRun the following cell to load the necessary packages. Make sure to change the Accelerator on the right to `TPU`.","5cb9157b":"Currently our dataset is just a list of filenames. We want to map each filename to the corresponding (image, label) pair. The following methods will help us do that.\n\nAs we only have two labels, we will rewrite the label so that `1` or `True` indicates pneumonia and `0` or `False` indicates normal.","b12873ce":"# 7. Finetune the model\n\nFinetuning is an art when it comes to Machine Learning, and there are many ways to adjust the model in efforts to improve it. Finetuning is beyond the scope of this notebook, but check out this [article](https:\/\/www.pyimagesearch.com\/2019\/06\/03\/fine-tuning-with-keras-and-deep-learning\/) for more information.\n\nFor our purposes, we'll use Keras callbacks to further finetune our model. The checkpoint callback saves the best weights of the model, so next time we want to use the model, we do not have to spend time training it. The early stopping callback stops the training process when the model starts becoming stagnant, or even worse, when the model starts overfitting. Since we set `restore_best_weights` to `True`, the returned model at the end of the training process will be the model with the best weights (i.e. low loss and high accuracy).","9592c0a9":"We see that the accuracy for our model is around 98%. Finetune the model further to see if we can achieve a higher accuracy.","91963a63":"Let's visualize the shape of an (image, label) pair.","77d1eb23":"# 8. Visualizing model performance\n\nLet's plot the model accuracy and loss for the training and the validating set. These plots show the accuracy and loss values for the second round of training. Since we initially trained the model with 30 epochs, these would be epochs 31-45. Note that no random seed is specified for this notebook. For your notebook, there might be slight variance.","689c580a":"# 9.

Verify that the ratio of images is 80:20.","2a1b7dea":"# 6. Train the model\n\nSince there are only two possible labels for the image, we will be using the `binary_crossentropy` loss. When we fit the model, identify the class weights. Because we are using a TPU, training will be relatively quick.\n\nFor our metrics, we want to include precision and recall as they will provide use with a more informed picture of how good our model is. Accuracy tells us what fractions are the labels are correct. Since our data is not balanced, accuracy might give a skewed sense of a good model (i.e. a model that always predicts PNEUMONIA will be 74% accurate but is not a good model).\n\nPrecision is the number of true positives (TP) over the sum of TP and false positives (FP). It shows what fraction of labeled positives are actually correct.\n\nRecall is the number of TP over the sum of TP and false negatves (FN). It shows what fraction of actual positives are correct.","ee16dfdc":"We need a Google Cloud link to our data to load the data using a TPU. While we're at it, we instantiate constant variables.

This may indicate overfitting. Try finetuning the model further to decrease overfitting to the training and validation sets.\n\nOur recall is greater than our precision, indicating that almost all pneumonia images are correctly identified but some normal images are falsely identified. We should aim to increase our precision.","e085f0d9":"# 3.

We will correct for this imbalance later on in our notebook.","183c81ff":"The weight for class `0` (Normal) is a lot higher than the weight for class `1` (Pneumonia).

There are only 16 files in the validation folder, and we would prefer to have a less extreme division between the training and the validation set. We will append the validation files and create a new split that resembes the standard 80:20 division instead.","5e9f2488":"# 4. Build the CNN\n\nTo make our model more modular and easier to understand, let's define some blocks. As we're building a convolution neural network, we'll create a convolution block and a dense layer block.\n\nThe architecture for this CNN has been inspired by this [article](https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/deep-learning-for-detecting-pneumonia-from-x-ray-images-fc9a3d9fdba8).","daa16e3b":"From exploring the data and the model, I noticed that the training for the model has a slow start.
