Multiple eruptive lichenoid keratoses in sun-exposed sites are also described. Their colour varies from an initial reddish brown to a greyish purple\/brown as the lesion resolves several weeks or months later.\n* **[Solar lentigo](https:\/\/dermnetnz.org\/topics\/solar-lentigo\/)**: Solar lentigo is a harmless patch of darkened skin.

Here are the most promising we found: \n\nInterestingly, the body part from which the picture is taken is also imbalanced, with more than 50% corresponding to the torso. It will be interesting to see how it can impact the result.\n\n- **Dataset is generally imbalanced**, and even strongly imbalanced when it comes to the target (98% of the diagnosis are not melanoma)\n- The more aged a person, the more likely the diagnosis for a skin lesion would be melanoma. This seems to be especially true for men. \n- **Melanoma diagnosis seems to be more likey for men** than for women (but further investigation are needed to understand if this is not only an \"age effect\"). \n- **The skin site is also an important parameter**, with head\/neck & upper extremity more likely to result in a melanoma diagnosis. Here as well, there is apparently a \"sex effect\", with head\/neck sites far more likely to be associated with melanoma diagnosis for men than for women.\n- In this dataset, same patients appear usually more than once, as multiple site of lesions are pictured. Furthermore, information a site is likely to be useful for another site since **people with a melanoma are apparently more likely to have another one melanoma on another site.**\n\n\nI'll had new analysis later.

This is likely to be one of the difficulties of this competition. \n- If we look into the details of the target, in the \"diagnosis\" columns, we see that in most cases (80%), the status is \"unknown\", a probably very heterogeneous category. \n- Patients' sex is also slightly imbalanced, with a few more men. This data is almost always knwon. \n- Interestingly, the body part from which the picture is taken is also imbalanced, with more than 50% corresponding to the torso.

While ths can be associated with errors in the dataset, this is also probably associatded with the fact that those images have been taken at different moments.\n\nAnother interesting question - partially influence by the previous - is the quantity of information carried by an image about another of the same patient. In other words, for a given image, could we use other images of the patient to get information on the diagnosis of the first image? ","20f57c95":"### Takeaways: \n\n- There is not a huge difference between male and female age distributions. We should however note that since men are a bit more aged in this dataset, some slight \"sex effects\" could actually be explained by an \"age effect\". \n- As expected, diagnostic distribution differ with regard to the age: besides nevus and \"unknown\" lesions, all the lesion are more likely to appear later (40 years & more). \n- If we look more specifically at the target, we see that melanoma exist at any age, but it definitely becomes more likely with the age (> 40 years old and especially 70 years old). This correlation with age may be impacted by the sex (with for instance 40% of the diagnosis being melanoma for the most aged men - around 90 years old -  and far less for women), but this could also be an effect of data scarcity for some age range.
