Let's see what kind of courses are offered, how popular are they, and see what features make them so. I will be making various kinds of plots to see the distribution of the variables as well as better see the relationships. \n\nJust a side note: the data is not cleaned so you will have to mess around with a lot of the columns to make the data usable. Also, the data doesn't really look complete to me (or even a random subset of the entire data) as a lot of subjects offered on Udemy are missing.\n\nAlso, there is one music and spanish song course, and the data for that is wrong. Some people have dropped it, but you can see the observation I made and how to fix it here: [https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/andrewmvd\/udemy-courses\/discussion\/151353]. For now, I am only using a couple of columns, so I will fix the values as and when I need to.","4a2426b4":"Oh man. Not a good plot for Udemy course creators. Most courses are not popular at all and barely have \u226410000 subsribers. This means most courses are small. However, there are big hits as well, which you can see from all of the outliers. So looks like Udemy courses are an all or nothing game. Let's look at the subject popularity.","9df3bea2":"So we can see that the main titles used are 'Learn' and 'How to'. Many courses even try to make it explicit by mentioning 'for beginner', 'Course' and 'from Scratch'.\nAlthough this is great, I want to look at the titles chosen based on the subject, because you can see that the javascript word is bigger than the guitar word, purely because there are more javascript courses. So, let's split this up into different subjects.","d0ab33f4":"So business Finance and Web Development are extremely popular. Then there is musical instruments and graphic design. No wonder I keep getting those java script course emails!\n\nI don't think the data is anywhere near complete, since a lot of courses on big data and ML have come out. That doesn't fit into any category here, so this dataset is very limited.\n\nLet's look at the level of the courses.","2c6328ed":"So we see popularity of the general words to describe the category, 'trading', 'accounting', 'stock', etc. We also see lots of the general words like how to, and learn.","0d59477e":"# Multi-variate analysis - Understand 3 variables at a time!\n\nI want to see the relationship between whether a course is paid, the subject, and the number of subscribers. I suppose that some subjects can get a higher turnout even if they are paid, so let's see which ones. We will use a violin plot.","383d73af":"# Conclusion\n\n1. Udemy Courses either go big or bust ( by bust I mean they have very few subscribers). So for content creators, it is almost like an all or nothing game.\n2. Free courses have a huge number of subscribers (it is kind of obvious I guess).\n3. If a course is paid, the price of the course doesn't really affect the number of subscribers much. In fact, in paid courses, the only one with high number of subscribers are the expensive ones. \n4. Expensive courses are generally longer - I guess this is kind of obvious as well.\n5. Udemy courses generally have the title: 'Learn to use {tool or topic specific to subject} from scratch'.\n\n\nI hoped you liked this notebook a lot. I tried using a variety of plots to bring out a better understanding. If you liked the visualizations, please upvote the notebook (this is just a friendly reminder). Do leave feedback in the comments. I'll try to work on it.","b566d1dc":"This plot explains quite a bit. Remember all of those outlers we saw in the number of subscribers, most of them came from the free courses. That doesn't mean, however, that even paid courses go big. Look at the web development section. Maybe this is why this subject is very popular?\n\nWe see that courses in Business Finance and Graphics design, get a very low turnout if they are paid, so people take courses in these subjects only if they are free. Musical instruments have a higher turnout for paid courses, but not much more. Web Development gyush can charge money and still get a decent turnout. Also, web development's free course graph is extremely skewed so it probably means that everyone wants to learn web development, but aren't dedicated enough to actually pay for the course.\n\nNow let's look at the relationship between price, number of subscribers and number of lectures.. We will use a bubble plot.","4f890c2b":"This plot may lag quite a bit, because its quite bulky. Anyhow, I think it gives a lot of information","61a7bd99":"Again we see the tools used in graphics design, like photoshop, adobe illustrator, Logo Design, etc. Again the how to and learn is present in the title.","2d7a7e7f":"y - axis: number of subscribers\nx - axis: price of course\nbubble size: number of lectures\n\nNow we can understand the effect of prices better. As expected, free courses, and many paid, have large number of subscribers (as shows in the y-axis).\n\nOne more thing we can see is that as the price of the course increases, the size of the course also increases (you can see that the bubbles at the right are much larger than those on the left). This makes sense, cause if you pay more, you would expect more in return.\n\n\n# Word Cloud\n\nNow, let's see what kind of titles course creators give. We will use a word cloud as it is easy to see world popularity as well. If you are not familiar with word clouds, essentially, the larger a word is, the more frequently it is used.","e47e44ce":"Wow, basically everyone puts their course as all levels. I don't think course makers even bother with this part. They probably just enter all levels or beginners to attract the herd.","08173a50":"As expected, we see the different musical instruments used. Piano and Guitar look like they are the most popular.","0b93f3cc":"So we immediately see that most of the courses are paid, which makes sense to me as whenever I browse Udemy, I never see a free course. In fact, I didn't even know they existed!\n\nFirst off, let's plot a histogram for the price of the courses.","8d21b79a":"So most of the courses range from $25 to $50. This is the general price I see for most courses on the website (removing the permanent discounts!).\n\nLet's look at the distribution of subscribers"}}
