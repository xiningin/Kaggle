In 2020, apx 1 in 5 people represented by this population survey live in a city without a climate change plan in hand (apx. 109.25 Million people). This is a better ratio than in 2018 where 3 in 10 people represented by this population survey lived in a city without a climate change plan in hand; however that is still a very high number.

Below you'll find the first visualizations out of the analysis I'm undertaking as part of this project. As shown above, I'm looking at the contrast between how well countries\/cities are planning\/preparing on climate change, how they're dealing with chronic issues (such as long term mortality rates, which will serve as a proxy to how well they will deal with longterm damage being realized by climate change) and how they're dealing with the onset of the pandemic (which is my proxy to sudden life altering events that will become more frequent as climate change continues to accelerate). It is my belief that having proper procedures and planning in place is absolutely essential, however as my analysis below shows and will continue to show even this basic step is already setting many people at a possibly catastrophic disadvantage. Thus, I'm anticipating that my overall analysis will show that an outreach program to the most vulnerable areas will be most effective. I will then leverage the companies dataset to comeup with possibly climate change responsible partners to go along with in this endeavor. \n","19de6a09":"Hidden: imported libraries and setting up paths","87db3ef7":"# **FAILURE TO PLAN IS A PLAN TO FAIL**"}}
