In cases where the exact date of death is not known, this variable indicates the date in which the body or bodies were found. In cases where data are drawn from surviving migrants, witnesses or other interviews, this variable is entered as the date of the death as reported by the interviewee.  At a minimum, the month and the year of death is recorded. In some cases, official statistics are not disaggregated by the incident, meaning that data is reported as a total number of deaths occurring during a certain time period. In such cases the entry is marked as a \u201ccumulative total,\u201d and the latest date of the range is recorded, with the full dates recorded in the comments.\n|Reported year|The year in which the incident occurred.\n|Reported month|The month in which the incident occurred.\n|Number dead|The total number of people confirmed dead in one incident, i.e. the number of bodies recovered.

In some incidents, region of origin may be marked as \u201cPresumed\u201d or \u201c(P)\u201d if migrants travelling through that location are known to hail from a certain region. If unknown, the entry will be marked \u201cunknown\u201d.\n|Cause of death|The determination of conditions resulting in the migrant's death i.e. the circumstances of the event that produced the fatal injury. If unknown, the reason why is included where possible.
