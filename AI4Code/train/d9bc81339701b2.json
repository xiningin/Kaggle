So are they going straight, in circles, or something in between? The orientation graphs show it seems to be mostly straight but little variation. Maybe just minor noise because the robot is affected by something (maybe surface? or any other of many choices..). There will be more on this later in this kernel.\n\n- Soft tiles and hard tiles on large space show this strange sine curve shape of Z velocity going down. Hard tiles alone does not. These plots are for single values only, so maybe this does not generalize?

Many of these are same as in other kernels, others I made myself. Some reasoning for the features I added:\n\n- sum of diffs: If there is more vibration (or similar flakiness) on specific surface, maybe this will reflect that. If the robot has some shakiness on a surface in left\/right or up\/down directions, but otherwise goes straight on, they should cancel each other out. So the scale of this might also indicate if the robots go straight or not.\n- sum of absolute diffs: total amound of \"vibration\". As opposed to \"sum of diffs\", this is on absolute values so they will not cancel each other out. Maybe the classifier can use relations between the two to figure out real amount of \"vibration\".\n\nBesides these, I use many others collected from other kernels.
