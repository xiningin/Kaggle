Soul is the first Pixar film to feature an African-American protagonist.\nhttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Soul_(2020_film)\n\nDorothea Williams \n\nDorothea Williams is a supporting character in Disney\/Pixar's 2020 animated feature film, Soul. She is the leader of her band, The Dorothea Williams Quartet, and has a skilled performance with the saxophone. Dorothea helps Joe pursue his dream, which is to play with her once before his passing, and gives him a chance to preform with her at the Half Note Club. Skeptical of him, Dorothea initially believes Joe does not have what it takes to preform because of his current profession, but is proven wrong several times, and accepts Joe is more than a middle school music teacher, but also a passionate pianist.\nhttps:\/\/disney.fandom.com\/wiki\/Dorothea_Williams","914d0636":"#Only feet?!!!","442b9c34":"#Histograms","1e30ac55":"#Show the channels separately","c586c54a":"#Number of pixels","1aa2e953":"#Dissecting an image\n\nSuppose you want to extract a vertical and a horizontal section from the image.","73634f1f":"![](https:\/\/encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com\/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSAFwkWdiVZsCOHjnfbW_YJxFuX_bMAf3R7Aw&usqp=CAU)popsugar.com"}}
