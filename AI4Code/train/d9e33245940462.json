have pixels to the right of and below us. By default, PyTorch will\nslide the convolution kernel within the input picture, getting width - kernel_width +1\nhorizontal and vertical positions. For odd-sized kernels, this results in images that are one-half the convolution kernel\u2019s width (in our case, 3\/\/2 = 1) smaller on each side.\n\nThis explains why we\u2019re missing two pixels in each dimension.\n","d95f5ef5":"At some point in developing neural networks, we will find ourselves in a situation where\nwe want to compute something that the premade modules do not cover.

PyTorch allows us to use any computation in our model by subclassing nn.Module.\n\nIn order to subclass nn.Module, at a minimum we need to define a forward function that takes the inputs to the module and returns the output. This is where we define our\nmodule\u2019s computation. \n\nWith PyTorch, if we use standard torch operations, autograd will take care of the backward pass automatically; and indeed, an nn.Module never comes with a backward.\n\nTypically, our computation will use other modules\u2014premade like convolutions or\ncustomized. To include these submodules, we typically define them in the constructor\n__init__ and assign them to self for use in the forward function.

Adding depth to a model generally\nmakes training harder to converge. \n\nThe derivatives of the loss function with respect to\nthe parameters, especially those in early layers, need to be multiplied by a lot of other\nnumbers originating from the chain of derivative operations between the loss and the\nparameter. Those numbers being multiplied could be small, generating ever-smaller\nnumbers, or large, swallowing smaller numbers due to floating-point approximation.\nThe bottom line is that a long chain of multiplications will tend to make the contribution of the parameter to the gradient vanish, leading to ineffective training of that layer\nsince that parameter and others like it won\u2019t be properly updated.\n\n\n","a2dc7e37":"![](https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1200\/1*1okwhewf5KCtIPaFib4XaA.gif)","d1af109a":"In init we create nn.sequential containing a list of nn.sequential containing a list of RsBlock instances. nn.Sequentil will ensure that the output of one block is used as the input to the next.
