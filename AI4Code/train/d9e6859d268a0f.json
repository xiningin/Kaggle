This research intends to pinpoint the most relevant\/risk factors of heart disease as well as predict the overall risk using logistic regression\nData Preparation\n\n**Source**\nThe dataset is publically available on the Kaggle website, and it is from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. The classification goal is to predict whether the patient has 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD).The dataset provides the patients\u2019 information. It includes over 4,000 records and 15 attributes.\nVariables\nEach attribute is a potential risk factor. There are both demographic, behavioral and medical risk factors.\n\n**Demographic:**\n\n\u2022 Sex: male or female(Nominal)\n\u2022 Age: Age of the patient;(Continuous - Although the recorded ages have been truncated to whole numbers, the concept of age is continuous)\n\n**Behavioral**\n\n\u2022 Current Smoker: whether or not the patient is a current smoker (Nominal)\n\u2022 Cigs Per Day: the number of cigarettes that the person smoked on average in one day.(can be considered continuous as one can have any number of cigarettes, even half a cigarette.)\n\n**Medical( history)**\n\n\u2022 BP Meds: whether or not the patient was on blood pressure medication (Nominal)\n\u2022 Prevalent Stroke: whether or not the patient had previously had a stroke (Nominal)\n\u2022 Prevalent Hyp: whether or not the patient was hypertensive (Nominal)\n\u2022 Diabetes: whether or not the patient had diabetes (Nominal)\n\n**Medical(current)**\n\n\u2022 Tot Chol: total cholesterol level (Continuous)\n\n\u2022 Sys BP: systolic blood pressure (Continuous)\n\n\u2022 Dia BP: diastolic blood pressure (Continuous)\n\n\u2022 BMI: Body Mass Index (Continuous)\n\n\u2022 Heart Rate: heart rate (Continuous - In medical research, variables such as heart rate though in fact discrete, yet are considered continuous because of large number of possible values.)\n\n\u2022 Glucose: glucose level (Continuous)\nPredict variable (desired target)\n\n\u2022 10 year risk of coronary heart disease CHD (binary: \u201c1\u201d, means \u201cYes\u201d, \u201c0\u201d means \u201cNo\u201d)","674fc70f":"**MODEL** **BUILDING**"}}
