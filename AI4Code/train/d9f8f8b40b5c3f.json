first","3bb24f36":"# How to successfully shoot in the NBA\n\n### NBA Shot Log for the season 2014\/2015. Looking for a way to maximize the scoring success","07d27ee1":"As we can see, both two pointers and three pointers see a positive relationship between the percentage of shots made and the distance of the defender.\n\nThe relationship is very strong until a 7 ft distance (for two pointers) and 10 ft (for three pointers).\n\nThere are 100% and 0% shots strongly split between 100% for 2 pointers and 0% for three pointers.\n\nThis can be explained because two pointers with a very big defender distance could be fastbreak points (after a steal, for example) where the attacker can run towards the rim with no opposition.\n\nThe 0% three pointers are in general shots taken out of desperation at the end of the quarter, hoping in something good to happen!","1828bcd7":"As expected, the relationship is negative.\n\nWe can notice a raise in the percentage for the shots taken outside the paint: this is connected to the bimodal distribution we saw earlier: shots within 5 ft from the basket are probably the most valuable for teams. Further from 5ft there's an area where the FG% decreases (and decreases the number of shots taken, as seen earlier): these shots, that we can call _mid range shots_ are less and less interesting for the teams which prefer skipping shots from this distance and take _long two_ shots instead.","ea84f648":"## Waiting for a shot\n\nWhen do attackers decide to attack? Does the shot come right after leaving a screen or do players prefer isolating and taking more time (and dribbles) before shooting?","f74d8187":"## Shot efficiency\n\nLet's see now if these variables (shot distance, defender distance, touch time duration or dribbles) have some relationship with the percentage of making a successful shot.","24daef1f":"Both distributions are right-skewed and show a peak of Two Points shots taken between 2 and 4 ft from the defender, while the Three Points shots have the defender between 4 and 6 ft.\n\nBoth plots seem almost _normally distributed_ within the distances 0-6ft for Two Pointers and 2-9 ft for Three Pointers).\n\nThis difference in the distance from the defender can be explained by the lower efficiency of three points shots and by the fact that Two Pointers are taken from a more crowded area of the court.","69e6c2b5":"Two Points seem to show a counter-intuitive result, at least in the shots where the defender is closer.<br>\nShots where the defender is 3 to 6 ft away seem to average a higher number of dribbles and still record an increase in the efficiency.<br> This could be because that _extra_ dribble can give the advantage an attacker needs (for example, during a drive to the basket) to take a more efficient shot.\n\nThree pointers respect the \"the less the better\" rule: dribbling more leads to a shorter distance from the defender, while shots with less dribbles (out of a well studied play) lead to less pressed and more efficient shots.","6809e763":"Three pointers show an expected negative relationship too.\n\nIn this case, the decrease in the FGs made is constant (excluding the outliers between 35 and 43 ft, due to the very low number of shots taken).\n\nIt's remarkable the 1\/1 from 46.9 ft by Derrick Rose!","8d756e89":"Two Pointers show that this is not necessarily true. \n\nWe can see that the highest peak are shots taken from within 5 ft from the basket, but this distribution is bimodal and shows another interesting peak in the number of shots taken between 16 and 21 ft from the basket.\n\nThis is due to a drastic drop in the efficiency which starts from 5-6ft distance from the basket.<br>\nThe reasons for such efficiency drop could be connected to the defences collapsing into the _paint_ (the area right in front of the basket) making _midrange_ shots less convenient.","6283c237":"## Top Performances\n\nJust out of curiosity, I'm filtering out the top Three Points shooters, a hot topic since modern NBA sees new records in the number of Three Pointers taken each year.<br>\nWe will consider _Top Shooters_ thoese who took at least 300 Three Pointers during the Season and we'll check how they perform in terms of the parameters analised so far.\n\nThis could be interesting to see if all the Three Points shooters approach this fundamental in the same way, or there could be different ways for being efficient.","3f8fe86f":"## The secret to a successful shot\n\nThe last plot showed what's probably the strongest relationship: FG% seems influenced by the proximity of a defender and this is valid in both Two Points and Three Points shots.\n\nSince Basketball is a sport of movement, and you can't run with the ball without dribbling it, let's see how dribbles and touch time influence the FG%","45b3dfd5":"### Distance\n\nThe difference in terms of distance is not very pronounced between the top shooters. Steph Curry is the leader, but the 8th of the list (JJ Redick) shoots on average 1.3 ft closer.","1051e488":"With Two Pointers accounting for a scoring percentage of 48.9% and Three Pointers of 35%","5f9a8b7b":"## The Defender factor\n\nThe limited size of the court keeps the competition between attack and defence always on. And here is where tactics (in terms of team plays involving more than one player) come into play.\n\nWhat's the impact of a defender on the shooting percentage?","3f7a5506":"These extra statistics show strongly the personality or the skills of the players.\n\nAlready in the Season 2014\/2015 _James Harden_ was showing his attitude in keeping the ball for a long time (and a long number of dribbles) and yet shooting many three pointers (third overall).<br>\n\nThe above mentioned _Splash Brothers_ as well, show _Steph Curry_ as a better ball handler and someone who can score Three Pointers from crazy distance (the highest on average), while _Klay Thompson_ is always there ready to catch and shoot, keeping the ball 1.5 seconds and for less than a dribble.\n\n_Kyle Korver_ has been really impressive during the 2014\/2015 season, a bright example of what a high level _role player_ should be: shooting the 49% over almost 350 shots _never dribbling_ and keeping the ball for less than a second makes you understand that whenever he gets the ball wide open there's not much left to do for his opponents _but pray it will go out_!","a8c1c49a":"## Shooting from (how) far?\n\nAs mentioned before, distance is surely one of the main characteristics of a shot. It's easy to think that the closest to the basket the easiest the shot can be","0335242c":"### Distance from the Defender\n\nDanny Green excels in getting rid of the defender, averaging shoots with the defender 6.33 ft away. The second best performer is JJ Redick, a _specialist_ able to benefit the plays studied to free him for a shot.<br>\nThe 8th place belongs to James Harden and this result won't surprise you, after you've watched the following two plots.","d5900f14":"### Time factor\n\nConsidering the dimensions of the court and the small space available when attacking halfcourt, here is how the speed in shooting influence the shots percentage","e5b50af2":"### Shots Distribution\n\nIn the 2014\/2015 season, there still was a big difference in the number of _Two Point_ and _Three Point_ shots number.<br>\nTwo Pointers are about 3\/4 of the total number of shots taken","a3982eb3":"The Two Points shots percentage shows a negative relationship with the touch time.\n\nThe shots between 0 and 1 sec have a very high percentage and can be mostly shots like tap-ins or very well studied plays after a Time Out which bring the shooter very close to the basket.\n\nThe longer the ball is kept by a player and the lower the shot percentage appears to be.\n\nFor the three pointers the negative relationship seems confirmed, but it's probably smaller than for the Two Points.\n\nIn this case, plays like screens and the bigger distance from the basket could help the shooter take a \"better\" shot even after a long time with the ball in their hands.","3b131595":"The Three Points distance distribution is right skewed and shows that most of the shots were taken between the \"shortest\" distance possible (shooting Three Pointers from the arc, 23.75 ft from the basket, starts from the red line on the plot).\n\nThree pointers from at least 22 ft are taken from the side of the court, where three points shots are actually closer).\n\nIn both Three Pointers distances we can see that players don't suffer much shooting at least 1 ft further from the line.","2ea11a21":"## Where's the defender?\n\nIn all this, let's see where the defender is positioned when a player shoots","49bebca2":"### Dribbles\n\nThis plot confirms what seen in the previous one: we have star players like James Harden, who concentrates the attack on his hands dribbling on average 3.65 times before a shot, or other _playmaker-like_ players like Steph Curry and Brandon Knight.<br>\nAnd then there are the Three Points specialists, who are on the court waiting for their chance to shot and see nothing but the net!","8b308f29":"Shots are taken mostly within 2 seconds of touch time and within 2 dribbles. They've got to be fast!\n\nSpeed is a fundamental quality and in order to be an effective attacker, the execution of a shot needs to be fast enough anticipate the arrival of a defender.\n\nThese plots aggregate two pointers and three pointers and, since this seems an influencing parameter in the choice of a shot, we'll further investigate it later trying to understand if two pointers and three pointers follow the same rule.","6c202892":"Through this data we will try to understand which were the best shooting conditions in terms of:\n\n- **Distance from the basket**<br>\n- **Distance from the defender**<br>\n- **Touch time and number of dribbles**","ff6f506f":"### Dataset Overview\n\nThe dataset provides data about 126974 shots taken during the NBA Regular Season 2014\/2015. Each row records information like the _shooter_, the _shot type_, the _distance_ from the basket, the _result_, the _closest defender_ distance or information about at what time of the match the shot was taken.","36522b3b":"Kyle Korver is by far the best performer (48.99% over 345 shots), followed by the _Splash Brothers_ Klay Thompson and Steph Curry.\n\nIt's interesting to see that the top 8 players aren't all the same _kind_ of players.\nKorver is a specialist, someone with exceptional shooting skills but lacking in several other parts of the Game. We could say the same about JJ Redick and somehow Danny Green (Klay Thompson, in my opinion, is a quite halfway: an amazing shooter with good defensive skills as well).\n\nBut better ball handlers like James Harden or Steph Curry shoot with excellent percentages too."}}
