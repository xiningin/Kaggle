We also learnt how to _create new features_ which will in turn help us to better predict the survival. \n- We also make use of __pandas profiling__ feature to generate an html report containing all the information of the various features present in the dataset.\n- We have seen the impact of columns like _Age, Embarked, Fare, SibSp and Parch_ on the rate of survival.\n- The most important inference drawn from all this analysis is, we get to know what are the __features on which survival is highly positively and negatively coorelated with.__ \n- This analysis will help us to choose which __machine learning model__ we can apply to predict survival of test dataset.
