This could be contributed to California getting a early grip on the situation while the state of Illinois did not take actions, Chicago implemented stay at home orders and mask mandates.

There is multiple points on both the \"positive\" and \"death\" flatten on the line plot. The possible explaination that could coincide with this display is the active practice of social distancing and self-quarantine contributing to \"Flattening the Curve\". After a amount of time of the line being flat, then it starts to rise again. Possibly due to seeing family during the holidays and accumalting isolation fatigue.","35d6ccae":"Plotting the Positive statistics on the line graph.
