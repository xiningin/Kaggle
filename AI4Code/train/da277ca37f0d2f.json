In this step, you will create a CNN that classifies dog breeds.  You must create your CNN _from scratch_ (so, you can't use transfer learning _yet_!), and you must attain a test accuracy of at least 10%.  In Step 4 of this notebook, you will have the opportunity to use transfer learning to create a CNN that attains greatly improved accuracy.\n\nWe mention that the task of assigning breed to dogs from images is considered exceptionally challenging.  To see why, consider that *even a human* would have trouble distinguishing between a Brittany and a Welsh Springer Spaniel.  \n\nBrittany | Welsh Springer Spaniel\n- | - \n<img src=\"kaggle\/input\/helper\/images\/Brittany_02625.jpg\" width=\"100\"> | <img src=\"kaggle\/input\/helper\/images\/Welsh_springer_spaniel_08203.jpg\" width=\"200\">\n\nIt is not difficult to find other dog breed pairs with minimal inter-class variation (for instance, Curly-Coated Retrievers and American Water Spaniels).  \n\nCurly-Coated Retriever | American Water Spaniel\n- | -\n<img src=\"\/kaggle\/input\/helper\/images\/Curly-coated_retriever_03896.jpg\" width=\"200\"> | <img src=\"\/kaggle\/input\/helper\/images\/American_water_spaniel_00648.jpg\" width=\"200\">\n\n\nLikewise, recall that labradors come in yellow, chocolate, and black.  Your vision-based algorithm will have to conquer this high intra-class variation to determine how to classify all of these different shades as the same breed.  \n\nYellow Labrador | Chocolate Labrador | Black Labrador\n- | -\n<img src=\"\/kaggle\/input\/helper\/images\/Labrador_retriever_06457.jpg\" width=\"150\"> | <img src=\"\/kaggle\/input\/helper\/images\/Labrador_retriever_06455.jpg\" width=\"240\"> | <img src=\"\/kaggle\/input\/helper\/images\/Labrador_retriever_06449.jpg\" width=\"220\">\n\nWe also mention that random chance presents an exceptionally low bar: setting aside the fact that the classes are slightly imabalanced, a random guess will provide a correct answer roughly 1 in 133 times, which corresponds to an accuracy of less than 1%.  \n\nRemember that the practice is far ahead of the theory in deep learning.  Experiment with many different architectures, and trust your intuition.  And, of course, have fun!\n\n### (IMPLEMENTATION) Specify Data Loaders for the Dog Dataset\n\nUse the code cell below to write three separate [data loaders](http:\/\/pytorch.org\/docs\/stable\/data.html#torch.utils.data.DataLoader) for the training, validation, and test datasets of dog images (located at `dog_images\/train`, `dog_images\/valid`, and `dog_images\/test`, respectively).

Instructions will be provided for each section, and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a 'TODO' statement.

If a dog is detected in the image, it will provide an estimate of the dog's breed.  If a human is detected, it will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling.  The image below displays potential sample output of your finished project (... but we expect that each student's algorithm will behave differently!). \n\n![Sample Dog Output](images\/sample_dog_output.png)\n\nIn this real-world setting, you will need to piece together a series of models to perform different tasks; for instance, the algorithm that detects humans in an image will be different from the CNN that infers dog breed.

","fddd26d7":"### (IMPLEMENTATION) Write a Dog Detector\n\nWhile looking at the [dictionary](https:\/\/gist.github.com\/yrevar\/942d3a0ac09ec9e5eb3a), you will notice that the categories corresponding to dogs appear in an uninterrupted sequence and correspond to dictionary keys 151-268, inclusive, to include all categories from `'Chihuahua'` to `'Mexican hairless'`.  Thus, in order to check to see if an image is predicted to contain a dog by the pre-trained VGG-16 model, we need only check if the pre-trained model predicts an index between 151 and 268 (inclusive).\n\nUse these ideas to complete the `dog_detector` function below, which returns `True` if a dog is detected in an image (and `False` if not).","cc863297":"### Implementing Inception model to detect dogs","88b962b2":"### (IMPLEMENTATION) Specify Loss Function and Optimizer\n\nUse the next code cell to specify a [loss function](http:\/\/pytorch.org\/docs\/stable\/nn.html#loss-functions) and [optimizer](http:\/\/pytorch.org\/docs\/stable\/optim.html).  Save the chosen loss function as `criterion_scratch`, and the optimizer as `optimizer_scratch` below.","b6ab20fa":"<a id='step1'><\/a>\n## Step 1: Detect Humans\n\nIn this section, we use OpenCV's implementation of [Haar feature-based cascade classifiers](http:\/\/docs.opencv.org\/trunk\/d7\/d8b\/tutorial_py_face_detection.html) to detect human faces in images.  \n\nOpenCV provides many pre-trained face detectors, stored as XML files on [github](https:\/\/github.com\/opencv\/opencv\/tree\/master\/data\/haarcascades).  We have downloaded one of these detectors and stored it in the `haarcascades` directory.  In the next code cell, we demonstrate how to use this detector to find human faces in a sample image.","5a2fe800":"### Implementing facenet-pytorch for face detecting\n\nreference: https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/timesler\/guide-to-mtcnn-in-facenet-pytorch","813cb299":"Before using any of the face detectors, it is standard procedure to convert the images to grayscale.  The `detectMultiScale` function executes the classifier stored in `face_cascade` and takes the grayscale image as a parameter.  \n\nIn the above code, `faces` is a numpy array of detected faces, where each row corresponds to a detected face.  Each detected face is a 1D array with four entries that specifies the bounding box of the detected face.  The first two entries in the array (extracted in the above code as `x` and `y`) specify the horizontal and vertical positions of the top left corner of the bounding box.  The last two entries in the array (extracted here as `w` and `h`) specify the width and height of the box.\n\n### Write a Human Face Detector\n\nWe can use this procedure to write a function that returns `True` if a human face is detected in an image and `False` otherwise.  This function, aptly named `face_detector`, takes a string-valued file path to an image as input and appears in the code block below.","445ba305":"---\n<a id='step5'><\/a>\n## Step 5: Write your Algorithm\n\nWrite an algorithm that accepts a file path to an image and first determines whether the image contains a human, dog, or neither.  Then,\n- if a __dog__ is detected in the image, return the predicted breed.\n- if a __human__ is detected in the image, return the resembling dog breed.\n- if __neither__ is detected in the image, provide output that indicates an error.\n\nYou are welcome to write your own functions for detecting humans and dogs in images, but feel free to use the `face_detector` and `human_detector` functions developed above.  You are __required__ to use your CNN from Step 4 to predict dog breed.  \n\nSome sample output for our algorithm is provided below, but feel free to design your own user experience!\n\n![Sample Human Output](images\/sample_human_output.png)\n\n\n### (IMPLEMENTATION) Write your Algorithm"}}
