Basic Tools: Like python, R or SQL. You do not need to know everything. What you only need is to learn how to use **python**\n1. Basic Statistics: Like mean, median or standart deviation. If you know basic statistics, you can use **python** easily. \n1. Data Munging: Working with messy and difficult data. Like a inconsistent date and string formatting. As you guess, **python** helps us.\n1. Data Visualization: Title is actually explanatory. We will visualize the data with **python** like matplot and seaborn libraries.\n1. Machine Learning: You do not need to understand math behind the machine learning technique. You only need is understanding basics of machine learning and learning how to implement it while using **python**.\n\n### As a summary we will learn python to be data scientist !!!\n\n**Content:**\n1.
