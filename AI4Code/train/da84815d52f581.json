This will give us the idea of admission probabilities based on the feature value. For example, how the GRE score affects admission probability? We will be able to get answers to such questions by doing some charting. We first plot the GRE Score feature with the admit probability. We use matplotlib for plotting. The following code produces the desired plot.","85b1a62f":"# Visualizing the predictions"}}
