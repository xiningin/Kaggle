Clustering question tags\n\nHere we'll have a short look at the question tags in this competition to see whether we can find some useful clustering.","f272dcb2":"Leave a comment if you have any ideas or questions on this topic and upvote if you liked this quick overview!","73fe26b4":"So we run a community finding algorithm to separate the remaining nodes into the two clearly visible clusters. Plotting them in red\/blue just as a sanity check, no surprises here.","8ac7c016":"Plotting what's left of the graph, we can see two well separated clusters which are connected only by - guess what - tag number 162.","300bb36f":"So let's find all of these single-edge nodes, save them in a list and print out what they are connected to and with which weight (i.e., how often they occur with this one other tag).","9458ca48":"Now plotting the remaining graph, we see that there are a lot of nodes which are only connected to one other node. I.e., these are tags which show up either by themselves or paired with one certain other tag. This \"one certain other tag\" appears to be the same for all of these (all single-edge nodes connect to the same node in the middle).","4a93cbd5":"Quickly checking out how many questions end up in each community. The larger one of the two clusters has the most questions, followed by the group of tags which only show up by themselves or together with tag 162. Tags exclusively showing up alone have much fewer questions, closely followed by the smaller of the two tag clusters. One question has no community assigned to it (remember, we had to sort that one out manually at the beginning of this kernel).","3111536b":"Now we build a graph <code>G<\/code> using the <code>networkx<\/code> module. Each known tag is associated with a node in the graph, and connections between nodes (\"edges\") indicate tags occurring together. Each edge carries a weight, which we here define as the number of questions in which the two adjacent tags (nodes) occurred together.","f9e55870":"Just loading the <code>questions<\/code> dataframe here and turning the string-formatted lists of question tags into numpy arrays.","fce98b95":"Ok, so first let's find all the nodes without any edges and collect them in a list - these are all the tags which only show up alone, not together with any other tags. Then we remove them from the graph since we can't use them for any kind of clustering.","fa4b3412":"Using this dict we can fill a new column in the <code>questions<\/code> dataframe which assigns a community to each question, basically going by which community most of the tags belong into. Looking at the graphs above, for each question all tags apart from tag 162 should be in the same community anyway. To avoid unclarities if we have two tags and one of them is tag 162, we for now just ignore tag 162 if it is not the only tag present.","8acf6223":"All of these tags only show up in combination with tag 162 - seems to be some kind of meaningful tag. Let's take all of these single-edge tags out of the graph as well for now.","549cf147":"Forming a list of all available tags.","67f9a586":"So quick inventory check - what have we got by now:\n\n* A list with all tags which only occur by themselves (<code>c0<\/code> \/ community 0)\n* A list with all tags which only occur by themselves or together with tag 162 (<code>c1<\/code> \/ community 1)\n* Two well-separated clusters of the remaining tags (<code>c2<\/code> and <code>c3<\/code> \/ communities 2 and 3)\n\nThe code below just checks for duplicates to make sure we didn't mess up anything, and creates a dictionary with tags as keys and the tag's associated communities as values.","d4dc12c8":"Now let's see what it looks like if we plot that... it's clear that there are some tags which occur very often, with many different other tags. If we look closely, there are also some tags which only occur alone (the have no edge attached to them).","b2c72530":"Lastly, we save the column holding each question's community together with the <code>question_id<\/code> to a csv file for further use."}}
