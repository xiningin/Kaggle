You are asking him for the reason.\n\nHe came to visit you on Saturday but you were not there. So, he went back to his place on Saturay and came to your place on Sunday.\n\n\"He spent 30 in Day 1 by eating 3 times out and paid 2times for the transportation\"\n\n\"He spent 19 in Day 2 by eating 2 times out and reached your place by paying 1 time ticket\"\n        \n Also he tells you that you ate for the same amount and paid the same amount always for the ticket.\n As you are a math guy, you aregoing to solve this problem by Linear Equations\n \n So, your equation will be:\n \n>  3x + 2y = 30  ----- Day 1\n \n>  2x +  y = 19  ----- Day 2\n \n Here x is food and y is the bus ticket. Assume x and y are always constant (I know not all the restaurants won't charge you the same price but for this scenario, we will keep them constant)\n \n You will solve like this:\n\n\n>  3x + 2y = 30\n>  - 4x - 2y  = -38 (Day2 is multiplied by -2)\n>  -------------\n>  -x       = -8\n>  ------------\n \n So, x = 8\n \n \n Apply this to first\n \n 3 (8) + 2y = 30\n \n 24 + 2y = 30\n \n 2y = 30 - 24\n \n 2y = 6\n \n y = 3\n \n So, finally you got the answer: Your friend Chris spent 3 for the bus fare and 8$ for each time he had food outside. \n \n ","7ad5feaa":"So, \n\nHe spent\n\n\n**day 1:**\n\n3 times eating \n\n3 * 8 = 24\n\ntravel to and fro\n2 * 3 = 6\n\nday1 total: \n24 + 6 = 30\n \n \n\n\n\n**day 2:**\n\n2 times eating:\n2 * 8 = 16\n            \njust one way\n1 * 3 = 3\n\nday 2 total: \n16 + 3 = 19"}}
