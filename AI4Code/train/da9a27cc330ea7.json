It takes its name from the Greek word for a rainbow, which is also the name for the Greek goddess of the rainbow, Iris. Iris is also widely used as a common name for all Iris species, as well as some belonging to other closely related genera. Iris is extensively grown as ornamental plant in home and botanical gardens. The Iris flowers color ranges from white, pink, orange, purple, lavender.","9e868690":"**From above plot we can see that,**\n\n1.
