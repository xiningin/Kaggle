A \u201cstory\u201d could be defined any number of ways, and that\u2019s deliberate. The challenge is to deeply explore (through data) the impact, priorities, or concerns of a specific group of data science and machine learning practitioners. That group can be defined in the macro (for example: anyone who does most of their coding in Python) or the micro (for example: female data science students studying machine learning in masters programs). \n    \n*This is an opportunity to be creative and tell the story of a community you identify with or are passionate about!*\n\n","9b593de9":"<h3> <span style=\"font-family:Georgia;color:black;font-weight:bold;background:#EBE3DB\"> 2.9 Which of the following integrated development environments (IDE's) do you use on a regular basis?","30a65159":"<h3> <span style=\"font-family:Georgia;color:black;font-weight:bold;background:#EBE3DB\"> 2.10 Which of the following hosted notebook products do you use on a regular basis?","f422b895":"<h3> <span style=\"font-family:Georgia;color:black;font-weight:bold;background:#EBE3DB\"> 2.38 In the next 2 years, do you hope to become more familiar with any of these tools for managing ML experiments?\n","b035d170":"<blockquote><p><strong> \ud83d\udccc Takeaway :<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>There are Large number of men on data science field.<\/li>\n<li>As expected from the previous surveys thre small number of female kagglers than male.<\/li>\n<\/ul> ","b4f4c12d":"\n<h1><center><span style=\"font-family:Georgia;color:#E8DCCC;font-weight:bold;background:#97A37B\"> \ud83d\udcd5Importing Libraries & Datasets","5a4e5c5a":"<h3> <span style=\"font-family:Georgia;color:black;font-weight:bold;background:#EBE3DB\"> 2.7 What programming languages do you use on a regular basis?","cd146755":"<blockquote><p><strong> \ud83d\udccc Takeaway :<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Dataset contains the Questions and Survey results.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","9e18bdb9":"\n<h1><center><span style=\"font-family:Georgia;color:#E8DCCC;font-weight:bold;background:#97A37B\"> \ud83d\udd0dExploratory Data Analysis","cfcb133c":"<blockquote> <span style=\"font-family:Georgia;color:#CF673A;font-weight:bold;background:#E8DCCC\">Introduction:<\/span>\n\nHey! It's a great opportunity to get involved in the best and coolest community of Data Scientists, Statisticians, Coders, and Creatives. I look up to many people here and learned a lot in the past few months and want to get involved in the most creative competition of Kaggle's 5th Survey.\n\nI will try to do my best here with creativity and analysis. I am working on ideas on how I am going to tell the story, but I started with my favorite season of the year autumn so my colors are inspired by it. I will keep updating the notebook with new Ideas and hopefully will complete it before submission.\n\nLet's get started and Enjoy!\n\n\n","6d12dd6f":"<h3>Data Definition\n\n<table class=\"Data_Definition\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th class=\"header\">Number<\/th>\n      <th class=\"header\">Question<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Q1<\/td>\n      <td>What is your age (# years)?<\/td>\n    <\/tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Q2<\/td>\n      <td>What is your gender?<\/td>\n    <\/tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Q3<\/td>\n      <td>In which country do you currently reside?<\/td>\n    <\/tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Q4<\/td>\n      <td>What is the highest level of formal education that you have attained or plan to attain within the next 2 years?<\/td>\n    <\/tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Q5<\/td>\n      <td>Select the title most similar to your current role (or most recent title if retired)<\/td>\n    <\/tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Q6<\/td>\n      <td>For how many years have you been writing code and\/or programming?<\/td>\n    <\/tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Q7<\/td>\n      <td>What programming languages do you use on a regular basis?<\/td>\n    <\/tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Q8<\/td>\n      <td>What programming language would you recommend an aspiring data scientist to learn first?<\/td>\n    <\/tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Q9<\/td>\n      <td>Which of the following integrated development environments (IDE's) do you use on a regular basis?<\/td>\n    <\/tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Q10<\/td>\n      <td>Which of the following hosted notebook products do you use on a regular basis?
