Bounding boxes are messy! \n    * Giant bounding boxes should be filtered out by area and removed before model training.\n    * Micro bounding boxes. These can stay. They won't have much effect on the IOU metric.\n    * Some spikes are not surrounded by a bounding box (missing bounding boxes).","d8ffd614":"# Global Wheat Detection Competition EDA","413f0ef8":"Detection of wheat spikes with computer vision opens a lot of opportunity for the farmers and breeders like:\n* controlling the growth stage of the plants on the field: the number oand the area of spikes is raising closer to the harvest date;\n* controlling the heatlth of the plants: unusually small number or small size of plants might be a signal of deceased plants;\n* spikes density characteristic and approximate yield estimation for different varieties of wheat.\n\nIn this notebook I am exploring the data and giving some thoughts on what to pay attention when making and validating the models.","13a18196":"## Thoughts on Data Augmentation\n\nData augmentation is critical in this competition, because there is a relatively small training set. Data augmentation will allow to build robust models under given circumstances.\nWhat augmentations\/filers might work:\n* flipping images horizontally and vertically, because the orientation of original images is different;\n* crop-resize, because we can see spikes at different zoom levels;\n* different filters to adjust the lighting conditions. I suggest looking at [this competition](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/aptos2019-blindness-detection) for example.\n\nWhat to do with caution:\n* rotation might not work, because rotation messes up the bounding boxes.","8ce90af9":"__What are these anomally large bounding boxes??
