Incredibly fast (it\u2019s implemented in Cython). If you are familiar with the Python data science stack, spaCy is your `numpy` for NLP \u2013 it\u2019s reasonably low-level, but very intuitive and performant.However, since SpaCy is a relative new NLP library, and it\u2019s not as widely adopted as NLTK.","dfd8a598":"**There is no missing values.**","6bce9ca1":"## 3.1 Explore on Dataset","90df4e4f":"In case of Python3, replace \u201cpip\u201d with \u201cpip3\u201d in the above command.\n\nOR download the source from [here](https:\/\/pypi.org\/project\/spacy\/) and run the following command, after unzipping:","f3e2652e":"# 3.
