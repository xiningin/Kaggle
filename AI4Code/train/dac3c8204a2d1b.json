Lastly, in contrast to the fact that there were more non-fiction bestsellers, I saw that fiction books usually had higher ratings than non-fiction books did.","00e35ae1":"Load the required Libraries","e1fb61fa":"We Extract top 10 books with based upon reviews","ad9279b4":"# Most Expensive Authors","39e46768":"# Top 10 authors with highest rated books","09ef4c0b":"**FEATURES:**\n\n* Name - Name of the Book\n* Author - The author of the Book\n* User Rating - Amazon User Rating\n* Reviews - Number of written reviews on amazon\n* Price - The price of the book\n* Year - The Year(s) it ranked on the bestseller\n* Genre - Whether fiction or non-fiction","c116b2f2":"Here we group every year based on the user rating, reviews and price.
