[Intuitively understanding Convolutions for Deep Learning](https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/intuitively-understanding-convolutions-for-deep-learning-1f6f42faee1) by Irhum Shafkat\n2. [Convolutions in Depth](https:\/\/sgugger.github.io\/convolution-in-depth.html) by Sylvian Gugger (this article implements convolutions from scratch)\n\nThere are certain advantages offered by convolutional layers when working with image data:\n\n* **Fewer parameters**: A small set of parameters (the kernel) is used to calculate outputs of the entire image, so the model has much fewer parameters compared to a fully connected layer. \n* **Sparsity of connections**: In each layer, each output element only depends on a small number of input elements, which makes the forward and backward passes more efficient.\n* **Parameter sharing and spatial invariance**: The features learned by a kernel in one part of the image can be used to detect similar pattern in a different part of another image.\n\nWe will also use a [max-pooling](https:\/\/computersciencewiki.org\/index.php\/Max-pooling_\/_Pooling) layers to progressively decrease the height & width of the output tensors from each convolutional layer.\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/computersciencewiki.org\/images\/8\/8a\/MaxpoolSample2.png\" style=\"max-width:400px;\">\n\nBefore we define the entire model, let's look at how a single convolutional layer followed by a max-pooling layer operates on the data.","10cd62a2":"## Testing with individual images\n\nWhile we have been tracking the overall accuracy of a model so far, it's also a good idea to look at model's results on some sample images. Let's test out our model with some images from the predefined test dataset of 10000 images. We begin by creating a test dataset using the `ImageFolder` class.\n\n","87a2f176":"## Defining the Model (Convolutional Neural Network)\n\nIn our [previous tutorial](https:\/\/jovian.ml\/aakashns\/04-feedforward-nn), we defined a deep neural network with fully-connected layers using `nn.Linear`. For this tutorial however, we will use a convolutional neural network, using the `nn.Conv2d` class from PyTorch.\n\n> The 2D convolution is a fairly simple operation at heart: you start with a kernel, which is simply a small matrix of weights. This kernel \u201cslides\u201d over the 2D input data, performing an elementwise multiplication with the part of the input it is currently on, and then summing up the results into a single output pixel. - [Source](https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/intuitively-understanding-convolutions-for-deep-learning-1f6f42faee1)\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/1070\/1*Zx-ZMLKab7VOCQTxdZ1OAw.gif\" style=\"max-width:400px;\">\n\n\nLet us implement a convolution operation on a 1 channel image with a 3x3 kernel.","f63e896b":"The `Conv2d` layer transforms a 3-channel image to a 16-channel *feature map*, and the `MaxPool2d` layer halves the height and width. The feature map gets smaller as we add more layers, until we are finally left with a small feature map, which can be flattened into a vector. We can then add some fully connected layers at the end to get vector of size 10 for each image.\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/KKtPOKE.png\" style=\"max-width:540px\">\n\nLet's define the model by extending an `ImageClassificationBase` class which contains helper methods for training & validation.","e9a14fa6":"## Summary and Further Reading\/Exercises\n\nWe've covered a lot of ground in this tutorial. Here's quick recap of the topics:\n* Introduction to the CIFAR10 dataset for image classification\n* Downloading, extracing and loading an image dataset using `torchvision`\n* Show random batches of images in a grid using `torchvision.utils.make_grid`\n* Creating a convolutional neural network using with `nn.Conv2d` and `nn.MaxPool2d` layers\n* Capturing dataset information, metrics and hyperparameters using the `jovian` library\n* Training a convolutional neural network and visualizing the losses and errors\n* Understanding overfitting and the strategies for avoiding it (more on this later)\n* Generating predictions on single images from the test set\n* Saving and loading the model weights, and attaching them to the eperiment snaptshot using `jovian`\n\nThere's a lot of scope to experiment here, and I encourage you to use the interactive nature of Jupyter to play around with the various parameters. Here are a few ideas:\n* Try chaging the hyperparameters to achieve a higher accuracy within fewer epochs. You use the comparison table on the Jovian.ml project page to compare your experiments.\n* Try adding more convolutional layers, or increasing the number of channels in each convolutional layer\n* Try using a feedforward neural network and see what's the maximum accuracy you can achieve\n* Read about some of the startegies mentioned above for reducing overfitting and achieving better results, and try to implement them by looking into the PyTorch docs.\n* Modify this notebook to train a model for a different dataset (e.g. CIFAR100 or ImageNet)\n\nIn the next tutorial, we will continue to improve our model's accuracy using techniques like data augmentation, batch normalization and dropout. We will also learn about residual networks (or ResNets), a small but critical change to the model architecture that will significantly boost the performance of our model.

If you want to follow along and run the code as you read, you can choose the \"Run on Kaggle\" option from the \"Run\" dropdown above. \n\nOtherwise, to run the code on your machine, you can clone the notebook, install the required dependencies using [conda](https:\/\/conda.io), and start Jupyter by running the following commands:\n\n```\npip install jovian --upgrade           # Install the jovian library \njovian clone 05-cifar10-cnn            # Download notebook & dependencies\ncd 05-cifar10-cnn                      # Enter the created directory \nconda create -n 05-cifar10-cnn         # Create virtual env\nconda activate 05-cifar10-cnn          # Activate virtual env\nconda install jupyter                  # Install Jupyter\njupyter notebook                       # Start Jupyter\n```\n\nOn older versions of conda, you might need to run `source activate 05-cifar10-cnn` to activate the environment.

However, if you train the model for long enough, you will notice that the training loss continues to decrease, while the validation loss stops decreasing, and even starts to increase after a certain point! \n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/i.stack.imgur.com\/1QU0m.png\" style=\"max-width:400px;\">\n\nThis phenomenon is called **overfitting**, and it is the no. 1 why many machine learning models give rather terrible results on real-world data. It happens because the model, in an attempt to minimize the loss, starts to learn patters are are unique to the training data, sometimes even memorizing specific training examples. Because of this, the model does not generalize well to previously unseen data.\n\n\nFollowing are some common stragegies for avoiding overfitting:\n\n- Gathering and generating more training data, or adding noise to it\n- Using regularization techniques like batch normalization & dropout\n- Early stopping of model's training, when validation loss starts to increase\n\nWe will cover these topics in more detail in the next tutorial in this series, and learn how we can reach an accuracy of **over 90%** by making minor but important changes to our model.","dcce555a":"## Saving and loading the model\n\nSince we've trained our model for a long time and achieved a resonable accuracy, it would be a good idea to save the weights of the model to disk, so that we can reuse the model later and avoid retraining from scratch.

This suggests that we might need to use a more powerful model to capture the relationship between the images and the labels more accurately. This can be done by adding more convolutional layers to our model, or incrasing the no. of channels in each convolutional layer, or by using regularization techniques.\n\nWe can also plot the training and validation losses to study the trend.","3427ce92":"## Training and Validation Datasets\n\nWhile building real world machine learning models, it is quite common to split the dataset into 3 parts:\n\n1. **Training set** - used to train the model i.e. compute the loss and adjust the weights of the model using gradient descent.\n2. **Validation set** - used to evaluate the model while training, adjust hyperparameters (learning rate etc.) and pick the best version of the model.\n3. **Test set** - used to compare different models, or different types of modeling approaches, and report the final accuracy of the model.\n\nSince there's no predefined validation set, we can set aside a small portion (5000 images) of the training set to be used as the validation set. We'll use the `random_split` helper method from PyTorch to do this.
