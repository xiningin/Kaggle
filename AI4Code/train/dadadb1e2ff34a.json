But this large amount of territories does not lead to an equitable disposition of the population as most of the population lives in the western (European) part of Russia. This is most likely due to the suboptimal temperatures and living conditions in the central eastern part of the country as the northern part borders on the north pole while the southern part borders on not very hospitable territories.","d83a6fb8":"# **Easy preprocessing data**","5bc26904":"While, as we can see from the graph, **Lithuania is the country with the lowest growth rate**. It is even negative, which means that unfortunately there is not much immigration or there are more deaths than births.
