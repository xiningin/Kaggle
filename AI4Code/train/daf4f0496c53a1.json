This figure is the total amount of vaccine shots that each country has given. This does not mean that is the full amount of people vaccinated, as most of the current vaccines require two shots of the same vaccine. As well, people may also only have one dose applied to them, waiting for the second one.\n\nAs in the previous figures and also in the next ones the darker the color the bigger the number of vaccinations that have been applied.","fe7d8b45":"# Conclusion\n\nThere is a lot of stuff going on in the world right now, and with the unfortunate events of last year, truly everyone is hoping that it can end soon.

Various countries in Latinoamerica have or no date, or have not started their vaccination progress, this could tell us about the irregular distribution of vaccines around the world, especially to countries with a low GDP. ","899ad27c":"## People Vaccinated at least once\n\nThe next figures present the number of people that have received at least one shot of a vaccine. As we can observe it is a lower number of people vaccinated per country as the number of vaccines applied, for the same reason mentioned earlier, that many vaccines require two shots.","78e429b6":"## Total Vaccinations in the World \n\nIn the following chart, we can remark how the total vaccinations in the world have changed with time. In the cell below, it will display the current amount of vaccinations that have been made.","2995372b":"# Technologies\/Libraries Used\n\nFor this project I used mainly the following resources:\n1. Numpy\n2. Pandas\n3. Plotly\nNumpy mainly gives numeric facility and speed in processing, while pandas is a very useful tool for datasets processing and management. Finally, Plotly is an incredible tool for data visualization. \n\nEverything in this notebook was programmed in Python","9b04d20d":"## Scheme Vaccinations\n   \nThe next figure is a little strange but interesting. It presents the variations of schemes that every country uses. For example, if Mexico mainly uses vaccines Oxford\/AstraZeneca, Pfizer\/BioNTech, Sputnik V, that itself would be a vaccine scheme, so if another country uses the same three vaccines, would enter the same scheme.\n\nTherefore, the graph presents the number of vaccines that have been applied by each vaccination scheme.","f21d1c74":"# Mexico vs the World \n\nNow we are going to analyze in more detail how Mexico is doing with the vaccine application comparing it to other countries and itself. We Mexicans need to keep track of how our government is doing.","0a6886e3":"## Daily Vaccinations Mexico\n\nIn the figure below we can appreciate the daily vaccinations for Mexico alone. As we can see at the beginning it started with about 50k vaccines, but then it stopped from around Jan 29 until Feb 16, where it spiked again. While it may seem that a lot of vaccines are applied, the percentage of people vaccinated in Mexico is very low. You can observe in the graphs above, that is not even in the top 30 countries. \n\nIn the next couple of graphs, we will see how Mexico is comparing against other countries in Latinamerica","3b6ddd69":"## Daily Vaccinations \n\nThe next figure presents us the daily vaccinations per country. We represent the United States as the blue line for reference, while Mexico is the red line. Some points need to be considered, one of them is that sometimes a country goes one day to 0 vaccines applied, that could be either if in that day the country did not report how many vaccines they applied, or they applied none.\n\nThe figure is a 3D line graph and shows the top 25 countries in total vaccinations. It is easy to move around and check each country and its daily vaccinations. The x-axis represents the date, the y-axis represents the country, and the z-axis the daily amount of vaccinations.","c343c7f0":"## People Fully Vaccinated\n\nHere, we are presenting the number of people that are fully vaccinated, this implies that they have received the total doses for the vaccine they were applied to.\nIt is interesting to observe that the number of people fully vaccinated reduces by a lot compared to the number of people vaccinated with at least one dose, this would mean that many people have received one dose, but are still waiting for the second one.","82840922":"## Animation of Vaccines Progression\n\nIn the following figure, we can observe how vaccines have progressed in various countries around the world.\nSome things to look at in the following animation are:\n\n* Darker means more vaccines have been applied in that country\n* Not all countries appear colored at the end of the animation as not all countries have started their vaccinations or they don't have that data publicly available\n* The mathematical operation log2 was applied to this particular data animation for better visualization, as the current difference between top vaccinated countries like the United States and low vaccinated countries is too big, the animation would almost remain unchanged.\n\n**You can also move freely between the dates and hover on each country to examine the individual information on that current date. **","71cb2db7":"# Percentage of fully Vaccinations LATAM\n\nThe graph below is astonishing, as only Chile and Uruguay has surpassed 10% of its populations fully vaccinated. It is shocking. Even most of the Latam countries have below 5% in fully vaccinated persons.\n\nCould this show the inequality of the vaccine's distribution?","4ace46de":"# Data Visualization\n\nIn the next part of the notebook, we will be seeing all of our data visualization as well as some explanation of the data we are seeing.
