It has many applications including denoising, compression and structured prediction (kernel dependency estimation). \n\n**4.3.2 Incremental PCA:** \n\nIncremental PCA works similar to PCA but Depending on the size of the input data, incremental PCA is much more memory efficient. This technique allows for partial computations which almost exactly match the results of PCA while processing the data in a minibatch fashion.   \n\n**4.3.3 Sparse PCA:**   \n\nSparse PCA finds out the set of sparse components that can optimally reconstruct the data. The amount of sparseness is tunable parameter. \n\n**4.3.4 Mini Batch Sparse PCA:**    \n\nMini Batch Sparse PCA is similar to sparse PCA but it computes the components by taking mini batches at onces from the data. It is faster but less accurate. ","8ab2bc5e":"### 11. Lets further decompose the dataset into two components:  t- SNE \n\nt-SNE was introduced in 2008 as the method for dataset decomposition using non-linear relations.  (t-SNE) t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding is a non-linear dimensionality reduction algorithm used for exploring high-dimensional data. It maps multi-dimensional data to two or more dimensions suitable for human observation.  t-SNE is based on probability distributions with random walk on neighborhood graphs to find the structure within the data. The goal is to take a set of points in a high-dimensional space and find a representation of those points in a lower-dimensional space, typically the 2D plane. Lets apply it on the truncated svd components and further decompose the data into two components.\n\n","056cc1c1":"As we can see that most of the variables are not very highly correlated with the target variable, and a majority of the variable have exteremely low correlation with the target. \n\nSo use of basic statistics is one of the method through which one can get idea about features having statistical significance. The same can be used to handpick important features and discard others.  \n\n### 3. Decomposition into EigenVectors and EigenValues  \n\nIn linear algebra, an eigenvector of a linear transformation is a non-zero vector that changes by only a scalar factor when that linear transformation is applied to it. If T is a linear transformation from a vector space V over a field F into itself and v is a vector in V that is not the zero vector, then v is an eigenvector of T if T(v) is a scalar multiple of v. \n\n> T(v)= \u03bbv\n\n\nwhere \u03bb is a scalar value known as the eigenvalue or characteristic root associated with the eigenvector v. In terms of decomposition, eigen vectors are the principal components for any dataset. Lets visualize the individual and cumulative variance explained by eigen vectors. ","665aba5a":"### 2.

TruncatedSVD is very useful on large sparse datasets which cannot be centered without making use of too much of memory.\n\n### 6.

The dataset can be downloaded from this [link](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/santander-value-prediction-challenge\/data). In this kernel I have explained different approaches for dataset decomposition. \n\n\n### Introduction\n\n\nThe purpose of this kernel is to walkthrough different dataset decomposition techniques and their implementations.   Decomposition of dataset into lower dimensions often becomes an important task while deailing with datasets having larger number of features. Dimensionality Reduction refers to the process of converting a dataset having vast dimensions into a dataset with lesser number of dimensions. This process is done by ensuring that the information conveyed by the original dataset is not lost. \n\nCredits:\n- https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/arthurtok\/interactive-intro-to-dimensionality-reduction\n\n### Contents\n\n1.

Gaussian Random Projection  \n","1865ce6c":"Create the model with important features ","f05e4e4b":"#### Variable Variance \n\nVariance defines how the data is spread across the mean. It is calulcated by taking the square of difference of every value from the mean value for a variable. One of the statistical intution is that if the feature variance is very less, then the feature will add less contribution to the model. However, I donot follow this blindly as most of the deep learning and boosting modles are robust to such issues. But, variance can give an idea about the features which can be discarded. Atleast the features having zero variance can be discarded because they are essently constant features. (again, these features might not be significant when considered individually, but can be useful in the row wise aggregated features) ","d7ab345a":"### 5. Truncated SVD\n\nThe Singular-Value Decomposition or SVD is a matrix decomposition method for reducing a matrix to its constituent parts in order to make certain subsequent matrix calculations simpler. Truncated SVD is the variant of SVD which is also used for dimentionality reduction. Contrary to PCA, this estimator does not center the data before computing the singular value decomposition. This means it can work very well with sparse matrices efficiently. ","5147f2df":"So from the above graph we can observe the following points: About 500 features of this dataset can describe about 75% of the explained variance, About 1000 features of this dataset can describe about 90% of the explained variance and About 1500 features of this dataset can describe about 95% of the explained variance   \n\n\n### 4. PCA - Principal Component Analysis    \n\nPrincipal Component Analysis is the technique for finding most informative vectors of a high-dimensional datasets. In other words, PCA extracts the important variables in form of components from a datasets containing large number of features. The important features are extracted with the goal to capture maximum possible information from the dataset.  \n\nThe first principal component is a linear combination of dataset features having maximum variance. It determines the direction of highest variability in the data. If the components are uncorrelated, their directions should be orthogonal. This suggests the correlation b\/w the components in zero. All succeeding principal component follows the similar concept i.e. they capture the remaining variation without being correlated with the previous component. \n\n\n### 4.1 Finding Right Number of Components\n\nWe observed from the cumulative frequency graph of eigen vectors that about 1000 variables can give upto 90% explained variance of the dataset. We can use PCA with N number of components and obtain the right number which matches a threshold value of explained variance. ","31b75ac6":"### 8.
