Almost all the people in our study strongly believe in data visualization.","a02deb2f":"# EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS: QUALITY DATA SCIENTIST AMONG KAGGLERS\nWHY THIS TOPIC?\n\nThis notebook aims at finding the number of quality data scientists among kagglers and to study their various attributes. The main purpose behind choosing this topic in particular is to help out beginners in Data science, being a student I myself have a hard time making simple choices while learning, researching what to choose from the crazy amount of options available. So, I thought it would be a perfect platform to learn from the members of the community by utilizing the little skills I have managed to gain till date. I will get back to the word \u2018Quality\u2019 shortly. With experts predicting that 40 zettabytes of data will be in existence by 2020, Data Science career opportunities will only shoot through the roof! This makes data science such an in-demand skill.\n\n\u2018QUALITY\u2019 DATA SCIENTIST\n\nIn this study I have taken certain factors into account to categorize a person as a \u2018Quality Data Scientist\u2019. I would like to highlight the fact that I am not an expert, I am a mere student and the considerations made by me are purely based on what I believe should be considered ideal.\n\n\u2022 Select any activities that make up an important part of your role at work (Q23)\n\nI haven\u2019t taken factors like age, education qualification, experience of coding into account as I strongly believe that age is just a number. Different people have different approach towards data science some take specialized degrees while some have no formal education yet come out exceptionally good. Similarly, the effective number of hours a person spends on coding cannot be determined.\n\n\u2022 Where do you publicly share or deploy your data analysis or machine learning applications?(Q36)","82a9f12c":"Most of the people falling under the category of quality DS have completed their master's followed by bachelor's degree. However,only a few have managed to get a doctoral degree. Also,there are significant amount of people who have not completed their bacherlor's yet manage to fulfill the criteria for quality DS.","85aa0573":"People with little experience of coding(<1,1-2 years) are mostly students. very few people amoung the respondents have never written a code.
