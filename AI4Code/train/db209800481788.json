And the answer is: **it is getting better**, at least in the data. Suicide rates have generally declined. **During the 2006-2015 decade, many countries saw their suicide rates decrease, compared to the 1996-2005 period. This trend is visible in virtually all broad age categories in both sexes**. The use of median suicide rate as representative of a decade (for a given country, age and gender) minimizes the risk that the observed effect is spurious due to randomness. I wish to all of us that this trend continues throughout the whole 21st century.\n\nAs for the reasons behind the observed change, there are many possibilities, which I would describe in broad strokes as follows:\n1. Mechanisms - intended or not - that make commiting suicide harder.\n2. Real sociological, psychological etc. factors keeping people away from thinking about suicide in the first place.\n3. Mistakes, biases, changes of methodology, or fraud, beginning with data collection at the local level.\n4. An error in my procedure of data extraction, processing or analysis.","79b73e05":"<h2>Table of contents<\/h2>\n* [Preliminaries](#preliminaries)\n* [Basic facts about suicide](#basic_facts)\n* [Operationalization](#operationalization)\n* [Results](#results)\n* [Conclusion](#conclusion)","8cd23e5e":"<a id='basic_facts'><\/a>\n<h2>Basic facts about suicide<\/h2>\nBefore looking at how things change over time, we shall observe a few basic facts about suicide:\n* Men are far more prone to commiting suicide than women, or at least this is what the data shows.\n* Young people, adolescents in particular, are *NOT* at the greatest risk. See the charts below. These are only examples, but this general pattern comes up time and again.\n* There are considerable differences between countries *even after* age standardization. Recall the WHO map above. \n\nSome part of the observed differences between countries and demographic groups may be explained by underreporting, biases and other issues with acknowledgment and classification of suicides.\n\n<p>The charts below show crude suicide rates per 100k population in 2015.<\/p>","7cdb72f8":"**To evaluate whether things are going in a positive direction or not, I compare median suicide rate in 2006-2015 versus 1996-2005.**\n\nTo make the charts more concise, I am capping that difference at +\/-20 (per 100k population). It is not necessary, and it does not affect the following results and conclusions, it just makes the charts nicer. \n\nA preview of the resulting table, seen below, helps understand how the rate difference is calculated. For example, in Albania, among women aged 25-34 the median suicide rate in 1996-2005 was 3.68 (`median_d1`) while in 2006-2015 it was 3.27 (`median_d2`), which gives a difference of -0.41 (`crude_rate_diff`).","9ebd1609":"Out of 44k total records, we have 36k (that is 82% of the dataset) with the crude rate calculated and all other columns filled with values.","31a988a5":"There is no clear trend in all of the younger age groups. There are many countries with relatively fewer suicides in 1996-2005 than in 1986-1995 period, but there are also many countries where the opposite happened, and these increases are sometimes large. Older age groups (35+) look better, especially among women.","5f672801":"<a id='preliminaries'><\/a>\n<h2>Preliminaries<\/h2>\nLet's make necessary imports. The dataset consists of the number of suicides each year in a given country, split by sex and age groups, plus the total population in according group, thus allowing us to calculate the **crude rates per 100k people**.\n<p>The use of rates seems obvious, as the sheer number of suicides corresponds to the size of the population: the bigger the country, the more suicides. What is less obvious is that these rates - also called *crude rates* - do not allow for a proper comparison between countries. Suicide rates, as we shall see, vary considerably depending on demographic groups, so for a country as a whole one has to take into account its current demographic structure. This is why WHO uses age-standardized rates:\n![](http:\/\/www.who.int\/mental_health\/suicide-prevention\/Global_AS_suicide_rates_bothsexes_2016.png)    ","5f182ab6":"<a id='operationalization'><\/a>\n<h2>Operationalization<\/h2>\nThe core of my analysis is a comparison between the recent rates of suicide versus the beginning of the 21st century, which I define as the 1996-2005 period, while by 'recent' I mean the 2006-2015 decade. Furthermore, I use the median rate from at least five years in a decade as a representative for that decade. This way we should be protected from noise, that is, fluctuations between single years that may not capture significant changes in major factors and mechanisms responsible for suicides. Because there are big differences in suicide rates between demographic groups, the median rate is calculated for each country, sex and age group separately. ","9f1a6aaa":"<h1>Suicide in the Twenty-First Century<\/h1>\nIn 2017, a man whom I considered one of the greatest musicians of all time and author, or co-author, of a number of songs that had become the soundtrack of my life, died in suicide. Many were shocked, and many miss him today.\n\nIn 2018, a man whose TV programs repeatedly kept me in a state of respect towards, and fascination about, the diversity of the world, died in suicide. Many were shocked, and many miss him today.\n\nClose to 800 000 less-famous people die due to suicide every year, according to [WHO](http:\/\/www.who.int\/mental_health\/prevention\/suicide\/suicideprevent\/en\/). I looked at the [WHO Suicide Statistics](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/szamil\/who-suicide-statistics) to see where the world as a whole is heading.\n\n**Is it getting better or worse?** You will see my answer below.\n\n<small>Note: whatever I do with the data and whatever conclusions I draw, none of it is approved or endorsed by WHO.<\/small>","4e467abb":"<h2>Further analysis: 1986-1995 extension<\/h2>\nEncouraged by one of my friends, I extended the analysis one decade back. The results are different this time.","f4ff4dd2":"It seems that the generally optimistic trend that we saw in the main part of this notebook is not a new phenomenon. The 1996-2005 decade was already better than 1986-1995, though only the older age groups (55+) seemed to benefit clearly. Let's keep in mind these were - and often still are - the people with the highest risk of suicide, so it looks that some relief came first to the ones who needed it the most.","14801e5e":"The data looks good, apart from some missing values. For now, I make two transformations to sort and show age categories more conveniently.","c3d96594":"Before starting this analysis, I was prepared to see an increase in suicide rates across sexes and age groups. I can now honestly say I am happy that I was wrong. Sure, there are countries which indeed saw an increase in suicides per capita in a given demographic group, and a few of these surges are dramatic. More often than not, however, **we see a positive change, concerning many countries, all age groups above 15, and especially men** (the reason why we don't see a huge improvement among women is that women already had relatively low suicide rates to begin with). The vast majority of the dots are either near zero (meaning no change) or below zero (meaning fewer deaths per capita than in the previous decade).\n\nTo quantify that notion, I put these results into three broad categories:\n* Increase in suicide rates. The difference between the median suicide rates in 2006-2015 versus 1996-2005 is positive and greater than (or equal to) a given threshold, which I set at 2 per 100k population.\n* No change. The difference is smaller than the threshold, either way (negative or positive).\n* Decrease in suicide rates.\n\nThe charts below confirm the positive change that is happening - the green bars are much higher than the brown(ish) ones.\n","2520574e":"<a id='results'><\/a>\n<h2>Results<\/h2>"}}
