If you remember back to the lessons on strings and lists, remember that we used a function len() to get the length of a string. Since checking the length of a sequence is a common task you would want to write a function that can do this repeatedly at command.Functions will be one of most basic levels of reusing code in Python, and it will also allow us to start thinking of program design (we will dive much deeper into the ideas of design when we learn about Object Oriented Programming).\n![Imgur](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/eahcBp0.jpg)","1a749009":"## 1.7 Errors and Exceptions Handling\nwe will learn about Errors and Exception Handling in Python.

We simply type the result as an expression instead of explicitly returning it. Because it is limited to an expression, a lambda is less general that a def. We can only squeeze design, to limit program nesting. lambda is designed for coding simple functions, and def handles the larger tasks.","57e1e491":"# Conclusion:\nThanks for reading this Bootcamp's notebook(Day02).
