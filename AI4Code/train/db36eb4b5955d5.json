","950245fa":"Now we actually need original targets.","c2fac0b3":"In this Kernel I'd like to share a couple of ideas which I found on Kernels myself:\n - adversarial validation\n - shakeup simulation\n\nOriginals where I've first seen these ideas implemented:\n - [Quora adversarial validation](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/tunguz\/quora-adversarial-validation) by Bojan Tunguz\n - [Quora shake-up simulation](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/quora-insincere-questions-classification\/discussion\/78952#463246) by some other master\n \n##  Adversarial validation\n \nThe idea of adversarial validation is to forget targets at all, concatenate training and test features, and label train instances with 1s and test instances - with 0s. Then we perform cross-validation, and finally see whether a model can distinguish train from test (if in such classification setting scores are pretty high) or not. \n - In the first case we can identify features (via weights\/feature importances) which help to distinguish train from test. Such features are \"suspicious\" - their distribution has most likely changes in the test set as compared to the training set. These features deserve special investigation (see [this example](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/tunguz\/ms-malware-adversarial-validation), again by Bojan Tunguz, from that funny [MS malware competition](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/microsoft-malware-prediction\/))\n - In the second case the model can not distinguish train from test just based on the provided features, that's a good sign","ac6ea7d9":"Plot the distribution of validation scores.","2c34a31d":"Grab just basic RF model and perform 5-fold cross-validation.","5aee375a":"We concatenate training and test sets, only features, no targets whatsoever.","6ea893c6":"We see \"nice\" AUCs around 51-52%. So the model doesn't distinguish train and test. That's good! So distributions of basic features that we've passed into the model are pretty much the same in training and test sets. "}}
