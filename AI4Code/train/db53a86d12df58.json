issued on average, then followed by permit type of category 3**\n\n**It's important to note that some permit types of category 2 takes the most time on average to process upto 3 years.**\n\n**It can be noted that the city's most existing construction type fall in the category of type 5.0 then followed by construction type 1.0.**\n\n# **Finally**\n \n# Using the given San Franscisco Building
