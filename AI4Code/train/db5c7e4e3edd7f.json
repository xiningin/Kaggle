There are several sensors and components like 360 cameras, RADAR, automatic identification system (AIS), GPS, echo sounders (SONARs), which can be used onboard autonomous ships to increase situational awareness.\n\nIn this study, I want to focus on image data. From the camera onboard autonomous ships, we can detect and identify nearby objects, especially ships. With the help of computer vision and deep learning algorithms, we can classify different ship types.\n\nIndividual ship types can be compared from the GPS and AIS data to verify that individual ship's identity. Autonomous ships can detect and report illegal fishing or migration boats to the national authorities.\n\nThe dataset used in this study is from Analytics Vidhya. 6252 ship images of 5 classes are divided into train, validation and test splits. Data augmentation is applied in order to increase the model performance. Instead of creating a custom convolutional neural network (CNN), a pre-trained Xception model is used as the base model.\n\nModel is evaluated with the confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall and F1 scores.\n\nAt the end of the study, 5 random images from another dataset are used for an additional demonstration of the model performance.\n\nResources\n\nDataset: https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/arpitjain007\/game-of-deep-learning-ship-datasets\n\nPhoto: https:\/\/www.liquid-robotics.com\/","67167bee":"I hope you liked this study and learned something new.
