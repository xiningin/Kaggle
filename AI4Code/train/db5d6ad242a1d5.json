infection. For example, in 1927, Swedish children who received BCG vaccination at birth had a mortality rate almost threefold lower than unvaccinated children. This decrease of mortality could not be explained by TB infection, and thus, early on, it was suggested that the very low mortality among BCG-vaccinated children may be caused by nonspecific immunity.\n\nIn West Africa, a BCG vaccination scar and a positive tuberculin reaction were associated with better survival during early childhood in an area with high mortality; this was not observed with other childhood vaccines. A general reduction in neonatal mortality linked to BCG vaccination was also reported in children from Guinea-Bissau, mainly due to fewer cases of neonatal sepsis, respiratory infection, and fever. The BCG vaccine appears to confer broad enhanced immunity to respiratory infections, as infants from Guinea-Bissau with acute viral infections of the lower respiratory tract were more likely to not have received BCG vaccination than matched controls.\n\nIn Spain, hospitalizations due to respiratory infections in 0- to 14-y-old children not attributable to TB were significantly lower in BCG-vaccinated compared to non-BCG-vaccinated children. The observation that this protection was still present in 14-y-old children suggests that the broad protective effect of BCG can be long lasting. Taken together, our current understanding of broad immune protection mediated by trained immunity and the epidemiologic evidence of long-lasting protection from viral infections of the respiratory tract, conferred by BCG vaccination, offer a rational biological basis for the potential protective effect of BCG vaccination from severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).https:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/early\/2020\/07\/07\/2008410117","5c99ddd3":"#Data Science Methods  \n\nAlthough media reports suggest consistent underreporting of COVID-19 deaths globally, this parameter is harder to manipulate than case numbers.

BCG vaccination data were collected at the country level based on policy of vaccination (i.e., current, interrupted, never) and the mean and median percentage of vaccination coverage during the period 1980\u20132018, assigning zero coverage to countries where BCG national vaccination campaigns have never been conducted. COVID-19\u2212related deaths were collected until April 22, 2020, and were standardized by population and stage of the epidemic.

BCG vaccination has shown clear protection in children, but, in adults, its effects have been inconsistent. Many countries initiated national BCG vaccination in the middle of the twentieth century with variable levels of coverage using different BCG strains, number of doses, and delivery method.\n\nAs the prevalence of TB decreased, countries like France, Germany, and Spain stopped mass vaccination of children and moved to vaccinate only individuals at high risk. Other countries like Russia, Ukraine, and China have continued national BCG vaccination to date. Some countries never established national universal BCG vaccination, including the United States and Italy, and only target high-risk individuals.https:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/early\/2020\/07\/07\/2008410117","4744a05d":"![](https:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/pnas\/early\/2020\/07\/07\/2008410117\/F1.medium.gif) By Luis E.

Air traffic has revealed a strong linear correlation between international COVID-19 cases and international passenger volume (r2 = 0.98, P < 0.01). \n\nIn large countries, such as the United States, Mexico, and Brazil, an epidemiological analysis at a country level does not consider the intense clustering of cases in states with large metropolitan areas and international airports, that were focal points of the pandemic. Thus, they decided to compare COVID-19 mortality in US states without BCG vaccination that have a high number of confirmed cases (more than 20,000 by April 20, 2020) with those states that were the main points of entry in Mexico and Brazil, as these two countries have current BCG vaccination programs.\n\nEvaluations were restricted to mortality 25 days after the first COVID-19 related death was registered. At the local level, they assessed the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany considering that East and West Germany followed different BCG vaccination schemes before the reunification in 1990. In West Germany, infants were vaccinated between 1961 and 1998. In East Germany, infants and 15-y-old teenagers with a negative skin test were vaccinated from 1951 to 1975 with at least one dose of BCG. German states were compared accounting by age structure, considering that most of the mortality in Germany (95%) was observed in older individuals (60 y old or more). They explored whether the broader range in BCG vaccination in eastern states of older individuals could reduce the mortality from COVID-19.https:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/early\/2020\/07\/07\/2008410117","45a7f902":"Considering the cross-protection reported for BCG vaccination on viral respiratory infections, recent publications have proposed that BCG vaccination could have protective effects against COVID-19 infection. These publications, however, do not include extensive statistical analysis, and the World Health Organization has cautioned about the lack of research regarding BCG vaccination against COVID-19 infection.\n\nIn view of the growing interest in assessing the plausible association between BCG vaccination and protection from severe COVID-19, they assessed available global data on BCG and COVID-19 to investigate the hypothesis that countries without a national BCG vaccination program would have greater COVID-19 mortality than countries that have a program. They attempted to control for potential confounding variables among countries, such as level of urbanization, population density, age classes, access to health, income, education, and stage and size of the COVID-19 epidemic. https:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/early\/2020\/07\/07\/2008410117","f6153e95":"They decided to compare COVID-19 mortality in states from the United States without BCG vaccination with those that were the main points of entry in Mexico and Brazil, as these two countries have current BCG vaccination programs.

This is remarkable, considering that three states from Latin America have much higher population densities than the North American states analyzed, including New York.\n\nGermany provides a unique opportunity to compare the potential effect of age of BCG vaccination on susceptibility to COVID-19, as, before the unification, East and West Germany followed different vaccination schemes. In West Germany, those 22 y to 59 y old today were vaccinated, while, in East Germany, those 45 years to 84 years old today received at least one dose of BCG. A comparison of these two regions revealed that the average COVID-19 mortality rate in western German states (40.5 per million) was 2.9-fold higher than in eastern states (14.2 per million) .

Signals of BCG vaccination effect on COVID-19 mortality are influenced by social, economic, and demographic differences between countries. After mitigating multiple confounding factors, several significant associations between BCG vaccination and reduced COVID-19 deaths were observed. That study highlights the need for mechanistic studies behind the effect of BCG vaccination on COVID-19, and for clinical evaluation of the effectiveness of BCG vaccination to protect from severe COVID-19.\n\nThey reviewed evidence for a potential biological basis of BCG cross-protection from severe COVID-19, and refined the epidemiological analysis to mitigate effects of potentially confounding factors (e.g., stage of the COVID-19 epidemic, development, rurality, population density, and age structure). A strong correlation between the BCG index, an estimation of the degree of universal BCG vaccination deployment in a country, and COVID-19 mortality in different socially similar European countries was observed (r2 = 0.88; P = 8 \u00d7 10\u22127), indicating that every 10% increase in the BCG index was associated with a 10.4% reduction in COVID-19 mortality. Results fail to confirm the null hypothesis of no association between BCG vaccination and COVID-19 mortality, and suggest that BCG could have a protective effect. Nevertheless, the analyses are restricted to coarse-scale signals and should be considered with caution. BCG vaccination clinical trials are required to corroborate the patterns detected there, and to establish causality between BCG vaccination and protection from severe COVID-19.

They focused on social variables as potential confounding factors, excluding climatic conditions in view of the lack of evidence for temperature dependence of the COVID-19 epidemic.\n\nPotential confounding variables were assessed based on access to health and education services and income (i.e., Human Development Index) , population size, human density, urbanization, and age structure of the population. They developed multiple linear regression models between COVID-19 deaths accumulated during the first month of mortalities by country (log) and the potential confounding variables and BCG data. They used adjusted Bayesian information criterion, adjusted r2, and Mallow\u2019s Cp metrics to determine the best variable combination and select the optimal model for COVID-19 death estimation.\n\nAnalyses included all predictor variables combinations and were performed in R software using the leaps package.

M. tuberculosis infection can remain latent for decades and reactivate in the elderly when a senescent immune system loses the ability to contain the infection. Nevertheless, a small study found that vaccination of adults \u2265 65 y old with BCG prevented acute upper respiratory tract infections, and there is an active clinical trial vaccinating adults aged >65 y with BCG to boost immunity.\n\nIf the BCG protection hypothesis holds true, it would have great implications for regions with ongoing universal vaccination programs, including most developing countries, as they may experience lower morbidity and mortality during the pandemic than in Europe and North America. They found that the number of years that universal BCG vaccination has been implemented in a given country and the level of vaccination coverage may play key roles in reducing of COVID-19 severity. \n\nSimilarly, individuals born in years with low BCG vaccine coverage would be populations at risk. Most Asian countries have active universal BCG vaccination programs. If BCG is conferring some basal level of protection from COVID-19, it is possible that some of the social distancing roll-back strategies taken by Asian countries, in order to restart their economies, may not be effective in North America and western European countries, and could result in a second wave of infections.\n\nThe understanding of the biology of innate immune training is in its infancy . Little is known about the capacity of BCG vaccination to confer broad immune enhancement and the functional correlates of protection. The inability to confirm the null hypothesis of no effect of BCG on COVID-19 mortality could be explained by an alternative hypothesis of cross-protection mediated by BCG vaccination. They note, however, that the data used in that epidemiological study have important sampling biases, and that the statistical signal detected at the country level may not explain COVID-19 mortality at the local level. The possibility that a single exposure to an attenuated pathogen during infancy could result in lifelong enhancement in immune surveillance is remarkable, but the available epidemiological data, in the absence of direct evidence from clinical trials, is not sufficient to recommend the use of BCG for the control and prevention of COVID-19 or other emerging infectious diseases.https:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/early\/2020\/07\/07\/2008410117","347f74ae":"Figure above: COVID-19 mortality, human development, and BCG vaccination policy by country.
