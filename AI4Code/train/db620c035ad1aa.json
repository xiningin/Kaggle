However, if we do not use random_state, data is split differently at each time and according to split accuracy will be different. Therefore, we can conclude that model performance is dependent on train_test_split. For example you split, fit and predict data 5 times and accuracies are 0.89, 0.9, 0.91, 0.92 and 0.93, respectively. Which accuracy do you use? Do you know what accuracy will be at 6th times split, train and predict. The answer is I do not know but if I use cross validation I can find acceptable accuracy.\n<br> Cross Validation (CV)\n* K folds = K fold CV.\n* Look at this image it defines better than me :)\n* When K is increase, computationally cost is increase\n* cross_val_score(reg,x,y,cv=5): use reg(linear regression) with x and y that we define at above and K is 5.

MACHINE LEARNING (ML)\nIn python there are some ML libraries like sklearn, keras or tensorflow.

If linear regression thinks that one of the feature is important, it gives high coefficient to this feature. However, this can cause overfitting that is like memorizing in KNN. In order to avoid overfitting, we use regularization that penalize large coefficients.\n\n* Ridge regression: First regularization technique. Also it is called L2 regularization. \n    * Ridge regression lost fuction = OLS + alpha * sum(parameter^2)\n    * alpha is parameter we need to choose to fit and predict. Picking alpha is similar to picking K in KNN. As you understand alpha is hyperparameter that we need to choose for best accuracy and model complexity. This process is called hyperparameter tuning.\n    * What if alpha is zero? lost function = OLS so that is linear rigression :)\n    * If alpha is small that can cause overfitting\n    * If alpha is big that can cause underfitting. But do not ask what is small and big. These can be change from problem to problem.\n* Lasso regression: Second regularization technique. Also it is called L1 regularization. \n    * Lasso regression lost fuction = OLS + alpha * sum(absolute_value(parameter))\n    * It can be used to select important features od the data. Because features whose values are not shrinked to zero, is chosen by lasso regression\n    * In order to choose feature, I add new features in our regression data\n    \n<br> Linear vs Ridge vs Lasso\nFirst impression: Linear\nFeature Selection: 1.Lasso 2.Ridge\nRegression model: 1.Ridge 2.Lasso 3.Linear \n\n","a34dd72d":"<a id=\"3\"><\/a> <br>\n### EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA)\n* In order to make something in data, as you know you need to explore data.

I do not know actually, we will see at the end of tutorial.\n<br> Now the question is why we choose K = 3 or what value we need to choose K. The answer is in model complexity\n\n<br> Model complexity:\n* K has general name. It is called a hyperparameter. For now just know K is hyperparameter and we need to choose it that gives best performace. \n* Literature says if k is small, model is complex model can lead to overfit. It means that model memorizes the train sets and cannot predict test set with good accuracy.\n* If k is big, model that is less complex model can lead to underfit. \n* At below, I range K value from 1 to 25(exclude) and find accuracy for each K value. As you can see in plot, when K is 1 it memozize train sets and cannot give good accuracy on test set (overfit). Also if K is 18, model is lead to underfit. Again accuracy is not enough. However look at when K is 18(best performance), accuracy has highest value almost 88%. \n\n","59b8cd0d":"As you can see:\n* length: 310 (range index)\n* Features are float\n* Target variables are object that is like string\n* Okey we have some ideas about data but lets look go inside data deeper\n    * describe(): I explain it in previous tutorial so there is a Quiz :)\n        * Why we need to see statistics like mean, std, max or min?
