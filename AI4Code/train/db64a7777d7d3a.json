Thus, these outlier observations no longer differ from the rest of the values at the tails of the distribution, as they are now all together in the same interval \/ bucket. In addition, by creating appropriate bins or intervals, discretisation can help spread the values of a skewed variable across a set of bins with equal number of observations.\n\n- There are several approaches to transform continuous variables into discrete ones. This process is also known as **binning**, with each bin being each  interval. \n\n- **Discretisation** refers to sorting the values of the variable into bins or intervals, also called buckets.

This technique preserves the variable distribution, and is well suited for data missing at random. But, we need to account for randomness by adequately setting a seed. Otherwise, the same missing observation could be replaced by different values in different code runs, and therefore lead to a different model predictions. This is not desirable when using our models within an organisation.\n\n- Replacing of NA by random sampling for categorical variables is exactly the same as for numerical variables.\n\n- Random sampling consist of taking a random observation from the pool of available observations of the variable, that is, from the pool of available categories, and using that randomly extracted value to fill the NA. In Random Sampling one takes as many random observations as missing values are present in the variable.\n\n- By random sampling observations of the present categories, we guarantee that the frequency of the different categories\/labels within the variable is preserved.\n\n### Assumptions\n\n- Random sample imputation has the assumption that the data are missing completely at random (MCAR). If this is the case, it makes sense to substitute the missing values, by values extracted from the original variable distribution\/ category frequency.\n ","b427b25b":"- We can use [Category Encoders Package](https:\/\/contrib.scikit-learn.org\/categorical-encoding\/) to perform ordinal encoding.

This technique is similar in essence to imputing by an arbitrary value. However, by placing the value at the end of the distribution, we need not look at each variable distribution individually, as the algorithm does it automatically for us. This imputation technique tends to work well with tree-based algorithms, but it may affect the performance of linear models, as it distorts the variable distribution.\n\n- On occasions, one has reasons to suspect that missing values are not missing at random. And if the value is missing, there has to be a reason for it. Therefore, we would like to capture this information.\n\n- Adding an additional variable indicating missingness may help with this task. However, the values are still missing in the original variable, and they need to be replaced if we plan to use the variable in machine learning.\n\n- So, we will replace the NA, by values that are at the far end of the distribution of the variable.\n\n- The rationale is that if the value is missing, it has to be for a reason, therefore, we would not like to replace missing values for the mean and make that observation look like the majority of our observations. Instead, we want to flag that observation as different, and therefore we assign a value that is at the tail of the distribution, where observations are rarely represented in the population.","d5fcd904":"- We can see that there are different passengers in each age bucket label.","90a4f6cd":"### **Fill missing data with random sample**","558a875f":"# **9.

If we encode categories arbitrarily, we assign an integer per category from 1 to n, where n is the number of unique categories. If instead, we assign the integers in an informed manner, we observe the target distribution: we order the categories from 1 to n, assigning 1 to the category for which the observations show the highest mean of target value, and n to the category with the lowest target mean value.","918528fa":"The exponential transformation is the best of all the transformations above, at the time of generating a variable that is normally distributed.

This variable takes the value 1 if the observation is missing, or 0 otherwise. One thing to notice is that we still need to replace the missing values in the original variable, which we tend to do with mean or median imputation. By using these 2 techniques together, if the missing value has predictive power, it will be captured by the missing indicator, and if it doesn\u2019t it will be masked by the mean \/ median imputation. \n\n- These 2 techniques in combination tend to work well with linear models. But, adding a missing indicator expands the feature space and, as multiple variables tend to have missing values for the same observations, many of these newly created binary variables could be identical or highly correlated.","bba7bbb8":"- So, in datasets with many variables that contain missing data, CCA will typically not be an option as it will produce a reduced dataset with complete observations. However, if only a subset of the variables from the dataset will be used, we could evaluate variable by variable, whether we choose to discard values with NA, or to replace them with other methods.","190368f1":"## **3.1 Complete Case Analysis (CCA) ** <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"3.1\"><\/a>\n\n[Table of Contents](#0.1)\n\n\n- **Complete case analysis** implies analysing only those observations in the dataset that contain values in all the variables. In other words, in complete case analysis we remove all observations with missing values. This procedure is suitable when there are few observations with missing data in the dataset. \n\n- **So complete-case analysis (CCA)**, also called list-wise deletion of cases, consists in simply discarding observations where values in any of the variables are missing. Complete Case Analysis means literally analysing only those observations for which there is information in all of the variables (Xs).\n\n- But, if the dataset contains missing data across multiple variables, or some variables contain a high proportion of missing observations, we can easily remove a big chunk of the dataset, and this is undesirable. \n\n- CCA can be applied to both categorical and numerical variables.\n\n- In practice, CCA may be an acceptable method when the amount of missing information is small. In many real life datasets, the amount of missing data is never small, and therefore CCA is typically never an option.","6f910d49":"## **4.1 One-Hot Encoding (OHE) ** <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"4.1\"><\/a>\n\n[Table of Contents](#0.1)\n \n\n- OHE is the standard approach to encode categorical data.\n\n- One hot encoding (OHE) creates a binary variable for each one of the different categories present in a variable. These binary variables take 1 if the observation shows a certain category or 0 otherwise. OHE is suitable for linear models. But, OHE expands the feature space quite dramatically if the categorical variables are highly cardinal, or if there are many categorical variables. In addition, many of the derived dummy variables could be highly correlated.\n\n- OHE, consists of replacing the categorical variable by different boolean variables, which take value 0 or 1, to indicate whether or not a certain category \/ label of the variable was present for that observation. Each one of the boolean variables are also known as dummy variables or binary variables.\n\n- For example, from the categorical variable \"Gender\", with labels 'female' and 'male', we can generate the boolean variable \"female\", which takes 1 if the person is female or 0 otherwise. We can also generate the variable male, which takes 1 if the person is \"male\" and 0 otherwise.","5e208ce0":"## **4.4 Target \/ Mean Encoding** <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"4.4\"><\/a>\n\n[Table of Contents](#0.1)\n\n\n- In target encoding, also called mean encoding, we replace each category of a variable, by the mean value of the target for the observations that show a certain category. For example, we have the categorical variable \u201ccity\u201d, and we want to predict if the customer will buy a TV provided we send a letter. If 30 percent of the people in the city \u201cLondon\u201d buy the TV, we would replace London by 0.3.\n\n\n- This technique has 3 advantages:\n\n  1. it does not expand the feature space,\n\n  2. it captures some information regarding the target at the time of encoding the category, and\n\n  3. it creates a monotonic relationship between the variable and the target. \n  \n\n- Monotonic relationships between variable and target tend to improve linear model performance.\n\n ","9ea9674c":"## **Conclusion - When to use each imputation method**\n\n\n- If missing values are less than 5% of the variable, then go for mean\/median imputation or random sample replacement. Impute by most frequent category if missing values are more than 5% of the variable. Do mean\/median imputation+adding an additional binary variable to capture missingness add a 'Missing' label in categorical variables.\n\n- If the number of NA in a variable is small, they are unlikely to have a strong impact on the variable \/ target that you are trying to predict. Therefore, treating them specially, will most certainly add noise to the variables. Therefore, it is more useful to replace by mean\/random sample to preserve the variable distribution.\n\n- If the variable \/ target you are trying to predict is however highly unbalanced, then it might be the case that this small number of NA are indeed informative. \n\n#### Exceptions\n\n- If we suspect that NAs are not missing at random and do not want to attribute the most common occurrence to NA, and if we don't want to increase the feature space by adding an additional variable to indicate missingness - in these cases, replace by a value at the far end of the distribution or an arbitrary value.","bda3343b":"## **7.3 Discretisation** <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"7.3\"><\/a>\n\n[Table of Contents](#0.1)\n\n- Discretisation handles outliers automatically, as outliers are sorted into the terminal bins, together with the other higher or lower value observations.

Outliers, by nature are not abundant, so this procedure should not distort the dataset dramatically. But if there are outliers across multiple variables, we may end up removing a big portion of the dataset.","8141f0db":"## **4.5 Weight of evidence** <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"4.5\"><\/a>\n\n[Table of Contents](#0.1)\n\n\n- Weight of evidence (WOE) is a technique used to encode categorical variables for classification. WOE is the natural logarithm of the probability of the target being 1 divided the probability of the target being 0. WOE has the property that its value will be 0 if the phenomenon is random; it will be bigger than 0 if the probability of the target being 0 is bigger, and it will be smaller than 0 when the probability of the target being 1 is greater.\n\n- WOE transformation creates a nice visual representation of the variable, because by looking at the WOE encoded variable, we can see, category by category, whether it favours the outcome of 0, or of 1. In addition, WOE creates a monotonic relationship between variable and target, and leaves all the variables within the same value range.","6835d217":"The Box Cox transformation was as good as the exponential transformation we performed above to make Age look more Gaussian.

When data is MCAR, there is absolutely no relationship between the data missing and any other values, observed or missing, within the dataset. In other words, those missing data points are a random subset of the data. There is nothing systematic going on that makes some data more likely to be missing than other.\n\n- If values for observations are missing completely at random, then disregarding those cases would not bias the inferences made.\n\n#### **Missing at Random, MAR**\n\n- MAR occurs when there is a systematic relationship between the propensity of missing values and the observed data. In other words, the probability an observation being missing depends only on available information (other variables in the dataset). For example, if men are more likely to disclose their weight than women, weight is MAR. The weight information will be missing at random for those men and women that decided not to disclose their weight, but as men are more prone to disclose it, there will be more missing values for women than for men.\n\n- In a situation like the above, if we decide to proceed with the variable with missing values (in this case weight), we might benefit from including gender to control the bias in weight for the missing observations.\n\n#### **Missing Not at Random, MNAR**\n\n- Missing of values is not at random (MNAR) if their being missing depends on information not recorded in the dataset. In other words, there is a mechanism or a reason why missing values are introduced in the dataset.","47da0d50":"The variable Age contains missing data, that I will fill by extracting a random sample of the variable.","9c2e5170":"## **6.2 Equal frequency discretisation with pandas qcut function** <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"6.2\"><\/a>\n\n[Table of Contents](#0.1)\n\n- Equal frequency binning divides the scope of possible values of the variable into N bins, where each bin carries the same amount of observations. This is particularly useful for skewed variables as it spreads the observations over the different bins equally. Typically, we find the interval boundaries by determining the quantiles.\n\n- Equal frequency discretisation using quantiles consists of dividing the continuous variable into N quantiles, N to be defined by the user. There is no rule of thumb to define N. However, if we think of the discrete variable as a categorical variable, where each bin is a category, we would like to keep N (the number of categories) low (typically no more than 10).\n\n- Source : https:\/\/pandas.pydata.org\/pandas-docs\/version\/0.23.4\/generated\/pandas.qcut.html","baa7080a":"- The arbitrary value has to be determined for each variable specifically. For example, for this dataset, the choice of replacing NA in age by 0 or 100 are valid, because none of those values are frequent in the original distribution of the variable, and they lie at the tails of the distribution.\n\n- However, if we were to replace NA in fare, those values are not good any more, because we can see that fare can take values of up to 500. So we might want to consider using 500 or 1000 to replace NA instead of 100.\n\n- We can see that this is totally arbitrary. But, it is used in the industry. Typical values chosen by companies are -9999 or 9999, or similar.","f9e0635a":"## **Age**\n\n\n### **Original distribution**\n\n\n- We can visualise the distribution of the `Age` variable, by plotting a histogram and the Q-Q plot.","ab327f10":"## **3.4 Replacement by Arbitrary Value** <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"3.4\"><\/a>\n\n[Table of Contents](#0.1)\n\n- Replacement by an arbitrary value, as its names indicates, refers to replacing missing data by any, arbitrarily determined value, but the same value for all missing data. Replacement by an arbitrary value is suitable if data is not missing at random, or if there is a huge proportion of missing values. If all values are positive, a typical replacement is -1. Alternatively, replacing by 999 or -999 are common practice. We need to anticipate that these arbitrary values are not a common occurrence in the variable. Replacement by arbitrary values however may not be suited for linear models, as it most likely will distort the distribution of the variables, and therefore model assumptions may not be met.\n\n \n- For categorical variables, this is the equivalent of replacing missing observations with the label \u201cMissing\u201d which is a widely adopted procedure.\n\n- Replacing the NA by artitrary values should be used when there are reasons to believe that the NA are not missing at random. In situations like this, we would not like to replace with the median or the mean, and therefore make the NA look like the majority of our observations.\n\n- Instead, we want to flag them. We want to capture the missingness somehow.","cfbbd573":"### **Imputation of Age variable**\n\n- `Age` is a continuous variable.

Mean \/ median \/ mode imputation is widely adopted in organisations and data competitions. Although in practice this technique is used in almost every situation, the procedure is suitable if data is missing at random and in small proportions. If there are a lot of missing observations, however, we will distort the distribution of the variable, as well as its relationship with other variables in the dataset. Distortion in the variable distribution may affect the performance of linear models. \n\n- Mean\/median imputation consists of replacing all occurrences of missing values (NA) within a variable by the mean (if the variable has a Gaussian distribution) or median (if the variable has a skewed distribution).\n\n- For categorical variables, replacement by the mode, is also known as replacement by the most frequent category.\n\n- Mean\/median imputation has the assumption that the data are missing completely at random (MCAR). If this is the case, we can think of replacing the NA with the most frequent occurrence of the variable, which is the mean if the variable has a Gaussian distribution, or the median otherwise.\n\n- The rationale is to replace the population of missing values with the most frequent value, since this is the most likely occurrence.\n\n- When replacing NA with the mean or median, the variance of the variable will be distorted if the number of NA is big respect to the total number of observations (since the imputed values do not differ from the mean or from each other). Therefore leading to underestimation of the variance.\n\n- In addition, estimates of covariance and correlations with other variables in the dataset may also be affected. This is because we may be destroying intrinsic correlations since the mean\/median that now replace NA will not preserve the relation with the remaining variables.","f65cf793":"## **4.3 Count and Frequency Encoding** <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"4.3\"><\/a>\n\n[Table of Contents](#0.1)\n\n\n- In count encoding we replace the categories by the count of the observations that show that category in the dataset. Similarly, we can replace the category by the frequency -or percentage- of observations in the dataset. That is, if 10 of our 100 observations show the colour blue, we would replace blue by 10 if doing count encoding, or by 0.1 if replacing by the frequency. These techniques capture the representation of each label in a dataset, but the encoding may not necessarily be predictive of the outcome. \n\n- This approach is heavily used in Kaggle competitions, wherein we replace each label of the categorical variable by the count, this is the amount of times each label appears in the dataset.

The two methods are equivalent.","2423ad34":"### **Fare**\n\n- The outliers, according to the above plot, lie all at the right side of the distribution.

As per Age, it is usually divided in certain groups according to the business need, for example division into  0-21 (for under-aged), 20-30 (for young adults), 30-40, 40-60, and > 60 (for retired or close to) are frequent.","b196febf":"- We can follow along same lines and fill missing values in `Cabin` and `Embarked` with the most frequent value.\n\n- **Mean\/Median\/Mode imputation** is the most common method to impute missing values."}}
