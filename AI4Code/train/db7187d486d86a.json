States and EU were increasing. This period was part of First Industrial Revolution when most production processes were transitioning to machine-operated. Since then an upward trend has been seen on carbon emissions around the world.\n* From 1984, there's a significant reduction in CO2 emissions across Europe. Similar decline in emissions was seen in the United States from 2006.\n* From 1950, Chinas's CO2 emission has been on the rise and it is currently the number contributor in the world.\n* International transport also contributes to the levels of emission each year. With the current coronavirus pandemic affecting most of the travels around the world, it is interesting to see how this affect the CO2 emissions.\n\nWith the downward trend being seen in European Union and  United States, it is important to know what are the mitigation measures and policies they put in place to achieve this.\n\nYou can hover through the graph to select the continent\/region you want to check.","c0917d71":"### Create separate dataframe for G20 countries","56db769a":"### G20 Countries: Trend\nYou can check the CO2 trend for each G20 country using the dropdown menu.","59e928df":"## Data Visualization","7f7ecf75":"### Create separate dataframe consisting continent\/region\nI have included China, United States, and International transport in this data because they have significant amount of CO2 emissions.","dcc498a3":"# Global CO2 Emissions\nBelow project aims to visualize the trends on total annual carbon dioxide emissions worldwide using `Altair`. This will be done on a global\/worldwide scale, and also by continent\/region. In addition, we will pick some countries (member countries of the G20), and see how much each contributes to the CO2 emission.","0e88c2f1":"### G20 Countries\nHere is an interactive chart to visualize how G20 member countries affects the CO2 emission levels in the world.

Country Names - e.g. United States, Canada, France, etc.\n    2. Region\/Continents\n        - Africa\n        - EU-28 - refers members of European Union\n        - Europe (other) - refers to Europe excluding EU nations\n        - Asia and Pacific (other) - refers to Asian countries excluding China and India\n        - Middle East - refers to Middle Eastern countries\n        - Americas (other) - not including United States\n    3. International transport - refers to aviation and shipping that contributes to global CO2 emissions\n    4. Statistical differences - refers to the difference between global emissions and the sum of all national emissions plus bunker fuels.\n*  There are missing values in the `Code` column and since we are not going to use this column during  visualization, we will drop this instead.\n* Adding new columns to the dataframe: \n    1. `Annual_Emissions` - derived from column `Annual CO\u2082 emissions (tonnes )` divided by 1 Billion. This will give us a smaller range to work on. Note that the unit for this column is `billion tonnes`.\n    2. `DT_Year` - derived from `Year` column.\n* Removing columns:\n    1. `Code` - there are many missing values in this column; this column is not critical to visualization since it only contains codes unique to each country.\n    2. `Annual CO\u2082 emissions (tonnes )` - this has a very wide range (between 0 - 36 Billion) and is not ideal in visualization as it affects the scaling. \n","0e556582":"### By region: Interactive Bar Graph\n\nHere is another illustration on how each continent\/region contributes to the worldwide level of CO2 emissions. The `World` bar graph is the total annual CO2 emission. You can use the slider to select the year and to output the corresponding CO2 emission. "}}
