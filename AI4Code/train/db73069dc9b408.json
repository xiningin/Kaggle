AutoNLP was developed under AutoVIML which stands for Automatic Variant Interpretable ML.\n\n**Some of the features of AutoNLP are:**\n\n\n1. Data cleansing: The entire dataset can be sent to the model without performing any process like vectorization. It even fills the missing data and cleans the data automatically.\n\n2. Uses feature tools library for feature extraction: Feature Tools is another great library that helps in feature engineering and extraction in any easy way. \n\n3. Model performance and graphs are produced automatically: Just by setting the verbose, the model graph and performance can be shown.\n\n4. Feature reduction is automatic: With huge datasets, it becomes tough to select the best features and perform EDA. But this is taken care of by AutoNLP."}}
