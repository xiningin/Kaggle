Evaluating machine learning models or algorithms is essential for any project. There are many different types of evaluation metrics available to test a model. These include classification accuracy, logarithmic loss, confusion matrix, and others. \n\n***Why is this Useful?***\n\nIt is very important to use multiple evaluation metrics to evaluate your model. This is because a model may perform well using one measurement from one evaluation metric, but may perform poorly using another measurement from another evaluation metric. Using evaluation metrics are critical in ensuring that your model is operating correctly and optimally. \n\n***Applications of Evaluation Metrics***\n* Statistical Analysis\n\n* Machine Learning\n\nSource: https:\/\/deepai.org\/machine-learning-glossary-and-terms\/evaluation-metrics","932e44a0":"<a id=\"27\"><\/a> \n### ROC Curve","f9cb4f19":"<a id=\"33\"><\/a> \n### GridSearchCV\n\nFor the hyperparameters and their values that are desired to be tested in the model, a separate model is established with all combinations and the most successful hyperparameter set is determined according to the specified metric.","a96d34b1":"<a id=\"25\"><\/a> \n### Confusion Matrix","c83ed96f":"Correlation specifies the direction and strength of the linear relationship between two random variables in correlation, probability theory and statistics.

Here, the k number (n_neighbors:) and the distance metric (metric:) to be used are the hyperparameters that should be specified by the data scientist before the modeling, which increases the performance of the model.\n\nHyperparameter optimization is the process of finding the most suitable hyperparameter combination according to the success metric specified for a machine learning algorithm.\n\nGiven that there are dozens of hyperparameters for a machine learning algorithm and dozens of values these hyperparameters can take, it's clear how difficult it will be to try all combinations one by one and pick the best combination.
