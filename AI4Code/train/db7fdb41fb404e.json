Further, as time marches on, economic, social, and political forces will be acting to change the level of inequality in any given country. The irregularity of the observations may disguise interesting trends within a country, to take one example, or patterns that represent causal forces acting on many countries at once, to take another example.\n\nWe need some way to summarize these numbers. For the sake of argument, we will assume that there is no systematic biases effecting when a country could be observed for the sake of this data set, meaning the mean of our observations should be a good estimator of the actual mean Gini index for each country over this period.\n\nWhile of less intrinsic interest, we also will look at minimum observed Gini indexes and maximum observed Gini indexes. Visualizing these alongside the mean Gini indexes should give a (rough!) intuition of variance.","4ac698c6":"### Kaggle Defaults","a30876cf":"## Linear Regressions and Visualizations","721416df":"## The World Bank's data set\n\nThe World Bank's dataset records various economic indicators for multiple regions and countries, with observations recorded by year. However, an observation does not exist for every indicator for every country. Furthermore, we are not necessarily interested in all the indicators in this data set. Because we are interested in seeing the relationship between corruption and *inequality*, we are most interested in their estimates of countries' Gini index, which is the standard measure of economic inequality. We shall therefore need to slice and clean the data frame.","a43a0e66":"### The Data Used Here\n\nThis project uses [this](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/transparencyint\/corruption-index) data set from Transparency International, and [this](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/theworldbank\/poverty-and-equity-database) data set from the World Bank. The former is representative of perceptions of corruption in 2017. The latter contains data about inequality observed over the course of 1974 through 2018.\n\nThis notebook was executed on [kaggle.com](http:\/\/kaggle.com), and a version of it will be maintained on [github](https:\/\/github.com\/keeganland\/econ323) ","f6e36bdd":"## Merging the data sets\n\n'Country Code' is common to both data sets, allowing us to easily perform a merge. We do an *inner* merge here because that automatically excludes countries (or regions) that are only in one data set or the other. The merged data frame still contains a majority of the countries in the world.","d2cb4c81":"## Gut check\n\nThe data does not look surprising. Countries that have a reputation as developing countries score poorly, whereas countries that have a reputation as wealthy, developed liberal democracies score highly. \n\nThis bar graph helps us get an intuitive feel for what CPI as a variable looks like. It varies from 0 to 100, 0 representing being perceived as most corrupt, 100 being least corrupt (that is, it runs on the \"high score = good\" intuition). It also serves as a guide, as the CPI varies numerically, which countries that numerical variation actually corresponds to.","bdf59ccb":"## Some further data cleaning\nSome observed countries simply do not have an observed Gini index at any point. These are no good to us for our purposes. We remove these from the data frame.","43819db8":"## What do these graphs mean?\n\nThe Gini index is often described as ranging from a score of 0, which represents a perfectly egalitarian economy with the income or wealth of every person in the economy is exactly equal, to a score of 100, which represents an economy where all the income or wealth goes to a single person and none goes to anyone else. Thus, a lower score is indicative of a more egalitarian economy, and a higher score is indicative of a less egalitarian. The Corruption Perception Index, however, works on the \"high score is good\" intuition. Low scorers are perceived as corrupt, high scorers are perceived as not corrupt. \n\nTherefore, given the empirical theories mentioned in the introduction about corruption and rent seeking causing inequality, we would predict there to be a *negative* relationship - which is exactly what our linear regression says we do predict. The slope (though not the intercept, obviously) is even roughly the same regardless of which representative Gini index number we use.\n\nThis is of minimum value for confirming the causal hypotheses discussed at the beginning of this report, but it is consistent with those hypotheses in such a way so as to suggest to us they are on the right track.","a8ff550e":"## The Transparency International data on corruption\n\nThis dataset requires very little cleaning. It contains one of the variables of interest (as well as information on measurement error) as well as country codes that can be used for data frame merges. We will do an initial bar-graph visualization of it in order to do an initial intituition check.","c072f62c":"## What is this project?\n\nInitial factor endowments in New World countries, especially how conducive those initial endowments were to equitable economic distribution, explain the paths of development those countries historically took. Countries such as the United States and Canada, despite relative lack of natural resources compared to South or Latin American countries, would experience considerably more economic growth, because their equitable initial conditions better enabled the development of institutions that could check against rent-seeking behaviour.\n\nRent-seeking is notoriously hard to quantify. Those who engage in such behaviour have an incentive to hide it. Gordon Tullock once observed that naive attempts to measure such behaviours appear to make them out to be much less costly than we would predict them to be, which throws in to question the quality of the measure. But, such behaviours should intuitively be correlated with perception of corruption in a country, which is something that is much easier to get data on thanks to the efforts of organizations such as Transparency International\n\nThe goal of this project is to gain a clearer intuition of the relation of distribution of wealth and perception of corruption through visualization. If the Sokoloff-Engerman hypothesis is true, then we would expect to find a correlation (though rigorously testing whether Sokoloff-Engerman hypothesis\u2019s explanation for such a correlation existing is correct is beyond the scope of this project)."}}
