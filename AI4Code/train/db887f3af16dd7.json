For example, if a query is formed that scans all of the data in a particular column, given how large BigQuery datasets are it wouldn't be too surprising if it burns through a large chunk of that monthly quota!\n\nFortunately, the bq_helper module gives us tools to very easily estimate the size of our queries before running a query. Start by drafting up a query using BigQuery's Standard SQL syntax. Next, call the estimate_query_size function which will return the size of the query in GB. That way you can get a sense of how much data is being scanned before actually running your query.","6257f267":"# How to Query Patent Examiner Data System (PEDS) Data (BigQuery)\n[Click here](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/mrisdal\/safely-analyzing-github-projects-popular-licenses) for a detailed notebook demonstrating how to use the bq_helper module and best practises for interacting with BigQuery datasets.","ca6d55d8":"## Example SQL Query\nSince the metadata is a little hard to understand, let's write a simple query that looks more closely at the content of a random column.
