In the field, we'll collect a spore print, look at morphological features, mark time of year, use smell, test for bruising, note the conditions it was found in: healthy or rotted terrain, neighbouring trees and plant life, near other fungi--all important steps in correctly identifying whether a find is edible or poisonous. \n\nWe can graph some of the data to determine if there are any features that are more associated with poisonous species at a glance before running our models and testing for important features.\n","dbfbf60e":"#### Mushrooms:\nMushrooms come in all shapes, sizes, colours, and flavours--as the saying goes: every mushroom is edible at least <i>once<\/i>.\n\nMushroom identification is a multifaceted process, where several important features of the fruiting body are taken into account before determining edibility. In addition to physical factors, the time of season and where a mushroom fruits (dirt, grass, manure, on a tree, on a fallen log, etc.) are also important considerations when id'ing fungi. Id'ing should always be done by an experienced mushroom hunter with local knowledge. \n\n#### Quick Poisonous Mushroom Identifiers\n* Spore Print: Spores are collected by placing a mushroom cap facedown over a sheet of paper or mirror. Different species' spores will be specific shades\/colours, for example genus <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Amanita\"><i>Amanita<\/i><\/a> will spore print white--poison. \n* Fruiting Body: Several dispersal mechanisms for spores have evolved; between gilled, porous, sac or puffball fungi poisonous species may all mimic edible look-a-likes. \n* Bruising\/Color: Certain species that bruise dark when handled can sometimes indicate poison or inedibility. \n* Morphology: \n   * The genus <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Amanita\"><i>Amanita<\/i><\/a> carries some of the some deadliest mushrooms in the world.
