To do so, we take ispiration from [EDA + Data Augmentation for Beginners](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/azaemon\/eda-data-augmentation-for-beginners) and use the package basic_image_eda, applying our exploratory analysis only to one of the subfolders to keep the computation time short enough.\n\n***Important note: In the end, the next two code blocks were taken from [EDA + Data Augmentation for Beginners](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/azaemon\/eda-data-augmentation-for-beginners) as they were (this might change in the future).
