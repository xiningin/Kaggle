It is usually caused by some of the most violent and energetic processes in the Universe.`\n\nThey are invisible but incredibly fast. \n\n**Why we need to detect GW?**\n\nDetecting and analyzing the information carried by gravitational waves is allowing us to observe the Universe in a way never before possible, providing astronomers and other scientists with their first glimpses of literally un-seeable wonders.\n When a gravitational wave passes by Earth, it squeezes and stretches space. LIGO can detect this squeezing and stretching. Each LIGO observatory has two \u201carms\u201d that are each more than 2 miles (4 kilometers) long.\n \n##### **above info collected via some very rough googling**\n \n### Goal\n\nThe GW was first detected\/seen when two blackholes merged into one big black whole back in Sept, 2015.\n\nIn this competition, our goal is to detect GW signals from the mergers of binary black holes.\n\nI am going to document this process as I start with zero idea about any of these.\n\nThe folowing two kernels have been my overall inspiration to understand this whole task to my best capability.
