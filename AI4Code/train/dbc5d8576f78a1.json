They can be defined with comma-separated values between square brackets. For example, here is a list of the first few prime numbers:","2cf89311":"Oh, that's right...\n\nTo avoid unpleasant surprises like this, we can use the `in` operator to determine whether a list contains a particular value:","8c6cb11b":"<!-- TODO:\ndir?\nA useful builtin method for interacting with objects is `dir`. `dir` asks: what are the names of all the things (methods, and attributes) that this object is carrying around?\nhelp(x)?\n-->\n\nThe examples above were utterly obscure.

We can access that stuff using Python's dot syntax.\n\nFor example, numbers in Python carry around an associated variable called `imag` representing their imaginary part.
