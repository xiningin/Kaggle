It is interesting to see that the passport power varies almost linearly for those of Upper and lower middle income countries and the low income countries. However, for a high income country, there is a greater possibility that it has a lower rank. Also the variability in the ranking is small for high and low income countries. In summary, economics plays a very good role in determining the strength of the passport.","9da2d5e0":"# Analysis on the Global power of passports\n\nA passport is a travel document issued by a country\u2019s government to its citizens that verifies the identity and nationality of the holder for the purpose of international travel. Earlier forms of passports have been historically used in ancient China and Islamic Caliphates to determine a persons ability to travel through different administrative regions present in those times. Passport in a modern sense is widely credited to Henry V of England as a means of helping his subjects to establish identity in foreign territories. These days with standaridization, machine readability and introduction of biometrics has made passports very secure and a cruicial identity card outside the country's border. However all passports are not made equal even though issued to an individual by its government. The strength is often related to the influence of the country in the global scene. \n\nThis simple notebook explores data on the strength of passports to come with meaningful interpretations. The data used here is from the https:\/\/www.passportindex.org\/byRank.php . It contains historical visa free scores and rank for the year 2015,2016,2017 and 2018. The other data files are that of migrant population count and economic status of countries.\n\n## Any additions and new interpretations are welcome!"}}
