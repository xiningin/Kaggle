This condition can lead to blindness if left untreated.\n\nWhat exactly is happening to the Retina?  \nDR is damage of blood vessels in the retina that happens due to diabetes.\n\nWhat are the symptoms?  \nCommon symptoms are blurred vision, color blindness, floaters and complete loss of vision.\n\nHow does a normal eye and an eye affected with DR looks?  \nThis image from American Optmetric Association shows the difference between a normal eye and a DR eye.\n![Normal Eye vs DR Eye](https:\/\/www.aoa.org\/Images\/public\/Diabetic_Retinopathy.jpg)  \n\nWhat other complications occur along with DR?  \n- **Vitreous hemorrhage** - Leak in new blood vessel\n- **Detached Retina** - Scar tissue that pulls the retina away from back of the eye\n- **Galucoma** - Blockage of the flow of fluid in the eye when new blood vessels form\n\nIs this curable?  \nYes to some extent but significant **side-effects** are anticipated in **Proliferative DR** condition."}}
