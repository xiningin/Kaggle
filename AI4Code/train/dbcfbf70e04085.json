However, <span style=\"background-color: #EFFBEF; height: 50%;\">American respondents ranked MOOCs worst vs traditional education when compared to other countries<\/span>. \n\nRespondents from India and China, on the other hand, seem to embrace online learning with open arms. Almost 80% of Indian respondents, for example, see online learning as better than brick and mortal institutions. Since the MOOC content is largely the same between countries, it stands to reason that <span style=\"background-color: #EFFBEF; height: 50%;\">the difference in opinion is due to quality of traditional education or access to that education<\/span>. There is evidence to support this, and the MIT Technology Review [4] put it best, I think:\n> In a country [India] of rigid teaching styles and scarce university slots, students and professors are exploring what online learning can be.","44e5017b":"# The MOOC Wars: Kaggle's Perspective\n\nMany of us come to Kaggle to learn. Weather it's through competitions, studying other's code, or reading the discussion threads to get inspired - all in a single, community-driven platform. Yet, this is not where our learning journey typically begins. We start in either college\/university classes or online courses on data science and machine learning. It will be instructive to look at the latter style of study in the context of data science students and professinoals.\n \n <img src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/yxazDyP.png\" align='right'>\n<span style=\"background-color: #EFFBEF; height: 50%;\">Massive Open Online Courses<\/span> (MOOC) have taken the world of learning by storm earlier this decade. No more does one have to be physically present at a brick and mortar institution to learn the subjects of statistics, computer science, and business. World class educators and leading researches are now delivered to your home through the magic of Internet. For free, a small fee, and sometimes heafty sums of $, some platforms even gave you a promise of gainful employment at the end of their certification program [1]. \n\nThe first MOOC that went \"viral\", so to speak, was actually one on artificial intelligence [2]. Data Sciene\/ML along with programming remain some of the most popular courses on these platforms. So, it should come as no surprise that on average <span style=\"background-color: #EFFBEF; height: 50%;\">Kagglers spend   25% of their learning time engaged with sites like<\/span> [Coursera](https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/), [Udacity](https:\/\/www.udacity.com), [edX](https:\/\/www.edx.org\/), and even Kaggle's very own [Kaggle Learn](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/learn\/overview). \n\nAverages, as we know, do not tell a rich story. What does the Kaggle community think about MOOC education? Which learning platforms excel at attracting and keeping DS\/ML students? How do the platforms stack up against each other? To answer these question, this notebook will explore a subset of 2018 Kaggle Survey Respondents who participate in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC).","31a5d478":"Second most popular MOOC platform, DataCamp, is on much shakier ground compared to its competition. Less than 60% of respondents choose it over edX and Udacity, and slightly over 60% when compared to Udemy. Kaggle's very own learning platform, <span style=\"background-color: #EFFBEF; height: 50%;\">Kaggle Learn, is equally preferred to DataCamp<\/span>, which is not something that's apparent from the simple count plot above.","a3363da5":"### ... but higher education means higher expectations\nThe sentiment around MOOCs is not uniform accross various levels of higher eduction. Respondents who have attained Bacherlor's degrees are much more enthusiastic (66% rank better, 12% rank worse) about MOOCs than those who put in more years of study to attain a Doctoral degree (48% rank better, 23% rank worse). This makes sense if we consider the advanced classes and rigorous research supervision that is seldom, if ever, found in online learning platforms. MOOC has other shortcommings as well, such as lack of student engagement in class discussion, low completion rates, and lack of feedback [3]. <span style=\"background-color: #EFFBEF; height: 50%;\">As it stands, online learning can be seen as augmenting education, not replacing it<\/span>. The milage varies, by country though.","390c719b":"### ... and so do multi-platform learners\nAmong respondents who use multiple MOOC platforms, Coursera holds the highest mindshare. <span style=\"background-color: #EFFBEF; height: 50%;\">Coursera is where 3,748 Kagglers spend most of their online learning time<\/span>. DataCamp and Udemy share second place, with roughly equal number of respondents choosing them. Udacity in fourth place, edX in fifth, while Kaggle Learn dropped all the way to #6 spot. To me this suggests that once a learner discovers other MOOC platforms, Kaggle Learn can rarely compete. Still, an impressive performace for a completely free resource. ","299dd128":"### Kagglers generally favour online learning...\nOverall, Kagglers seem to have a favourable view of MOOCs such as those found on platforms like Courseara, Udemy, or DataCamp. From close to 16,000 responses to question 39, I've excluded 1,564 that do not have an opinion on the matter. <span style=\"background-color: #EFFBEF; height: 50%;\">Close to 60% of remaining respondendents believe MOOCs are better than traditional eduction<\/span>, while 16% think they are worse. The sample is of course biased. After all we are asking people who actively engage with an online community - Kaggle.","153c3d43":"## What Kagglers think of MOOC?\nKaggle ML & DS survey asked a very interesting question (#39): \n> _How do you perceive the quality of online learning platforms [MOOCs] as compared to the quality of the education provided by traditional brick and mortar institutions?_\n\nTo answer this, a respondent did not have to have ever used a learning platform - only having an opinon was required, though an option of \"No opinion; I do not know\" was also available. In the end, a <span style=\"background-color: #EFFBEF; height: 50%;\">little over 60% of survey participants shared their attitude on the matter<\/span>. The distribution of answers tells a different story accross education and country of residence segments.\n\n_Note_: Before diving in, I preprocess the complete dataset in order to simplify analysis and make data visualization look better: convert range values to be ordinal, shorten some long category names, rename columns, and convert strings to numeric where appropriate.","8d30889c":"Does this mean Coursera is three times better than its closest rivals? Not exactly, but we can quantify the comparison better by pitting the MOOCs against one another, one pair at a time. Looking at respondents who use Coursera along with another platform (e.g. DataCamp) and using question 37 (which platform do you use the most?) as a proxy for users preference among platforms, I can see what percentage of people chose Coursera over each of the other platforms in top 5. For example, <span style=\"background-color: #EFFBEF; height: 50%;\">72% of respondents who have used both Coursera and Udacity (and other platforms potentially), spent more time engaging with the former<\/span>. Across its 4 closest competitors, Coursera does not dicisevely dominate against either, with DataCamp doing quite well in terms of winning Data Scientists' mindshare.","d4b238d2":"## References\n[1] [_Udacity U-Turns on Money Back Guarantee_](https:\/\/www.insidehighered.com\/news\/2018\/03\/16\/udacity-ends-pledge-students-get-hired-or-get-their-money-back).

Looking at these, I realize that I haven't heard about most of them. Of course, the brand names of Linkedin, YouTube, and Codecademy I'm familiar with, but <span style=\"background-color: #EFFBEF; height: 50%;\">stepik, pluralsight, nptel - this is the first I've heard of these<\/span>. Even as I tried to Google the resources there were some curious results. For exapmle, with [edureka](www.edureka.co) the second search result on Google was \"Do you mean Udemy?\". It was a clever ad by the more famous MOOC platform. When I went to see what [cognitive class ai](cognitiveclass.ai) is all about, there is an obvious banner ad at the top of the landing page directing me to take a Coursera IBM certification. Finally, [mlcourse.ai](mlcourse.ai) is just an offshoot of [ods.ai](ods.ai), a Russia-based Data Science community.  What's clear is the \"Other\" MOOC platforms are mostly smaller, nieche players that attract only a small fraction of Kagglers to their sites. In the next year's survey I would like Kaggle to include some of the heavyweights in the multiple choice, namely Linkedin and Codecademy, while TheSchool.AI and DataQuest can be safely pushed out.\n\n_Random fact_: more people spell Code**a**cademy (with an \"a\") rather than the actual name Codecademy. I wonder why they chose to drop the \"a\" in their brand. ","e686a10e":"## What's next for MOOCs?\nMOOCs have been around long enough to become established enterprises. In 2018, Forbes estimates that Coursera's revenue alone is close to $140 millionn USD[5]. With the company rumoured to go public, <span style=\"background-color: #EFFBEF; height: 50%;\">we will see an increased drive for growth from Coursera and its competitors<\/span> [6]. This growth will be <span style=\"background-color: #EFFBEF; height: 50%;\">fueled by evergrowing demand in the emerging markets<\/span> such as India and China, where access to higher education is more limited, as the demand for data science professionals steadily grows. While MOOCs are fighting for Kaggler's mindshare, we should ponder why we do online learning: is it to get an extra notch on our professional belt or is it for the sake of self-development? Answer to that question will help you decide if engaging with any of these learning platforms makes sense for you.\n\nFor myself, I go to MOOCs for one of two reasons: either out of interest in the subject area or to do a crash course in a technology for the purpose of passing a standardized certification exam. While I'm learning the subject I don't care so much about measurable outcome and while studying for a certification exam, I know the certificate (external to MOOC) is backed by a recognized institution. Online learning works for me in these scenarios, but I'm sure you can find many more uses for it.","78b4615f":"# Which MOOC platforms are winning?\n\nHere it is useful to define two groups of respondents: one that uses a single MOOC platform (n=5,992) and one that engage with multiple platforms (n=9,679). \n\n### Single-platform learners often choose Coursera as their sole study\nAmong single-platform users, Coursera ranks number one, followed by Kaggle's very own learning resource. Koodos to Kaggle for holding their own in a fairly competitive MOOC environment. It's even more impressive given that Kaggle Learn is an ancillary to the core service offering of the data science competition platform. Of course, the sample in the survey is heavily biased toward Kaggle users. Udemy and DataCamp are not far behind Kaggle Learn when it comes to single-platform learners. The takeaway is <span style=\"background-color: #EFFBEF; height: 50%;\">these 4 MOOCs have enough appeal for Kagglers to stick with them exclusively<\/span> and to not go looking for greener pastures... at least for some time. \n\n> _Note_: the \"Other\" category in question 36 responses will be explored separately in the appendix of this Kernel, if you are interested to know what other learning platforms your peers use."}}
