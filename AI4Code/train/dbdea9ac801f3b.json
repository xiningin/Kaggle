This reminds me of an article I read  a while ago saying that on average, the data science tenure in a role is only 6 months - this behavior can be linked with a multitude of aspects, such as high promises in new roles which fail to be delivered and make the data scientists move on, or the high demand of data scientists compared to existing supply, which make them fast to be \"poached\" by other companies. We can notice however, that data scientists hith Master's or PhD have higher percentages on all the other tenures (up to 20 years), compared to the Bachelor or lower degree holding data scientists.","e012c376":"### How about the differences in activities that make up their DS roles?\n\nAs the responses on data science role activities are multiple choice, I needed to do some more data cleaning in order to calculate the percentage totals. Looking at the comparing bar charts, there doesn't seem to be much difference in the education level, but further statistical tests can confirm. As expected, the top activity or the data scientists is to utilise data to drive business impact, followed closely by prototyping machine learning applications and building ML services to drive efficiencies and automation.","32359e55":"We can apply the chi square test for independence on the cross tab values to test whether the differences between groups are significant.","be1a1295":"Two thirds of the respondents have or are in the process of completing a higher education. These results will be interesting to compare to the actual demand for Master's and PhD from data scientist job descriptions.\nNow that we figured out the splits, let's have a look at their differences. ","e63a7ed8":"Let's filter by responses provided by Data Scientists only. I know I could increase the sample by adding roles in the area of Data science (such as data engineer or research scientist), but to keep things consistent, I will start by focusing on data scientists solely.","b99a9168":"### How about differences in undergraduate degrees?\n\nComputer science is the most popular undergraduate degree in both types of education, while engineering and mathematics degrees represent a higher proportion for respondents who hold a Master's or PhD. Looking at this chart, I found interesting that there is not much of a difference between percentages of data scientists who studied a business discipline in their undergraduate as highest level of education, and data scientists who studied business as an undergrad and went on to pursue a Master's or PhD - around 7% in both cases.  (which, you guessed right, is that I studied as an undergrad).","058d43e0":"There are not many data scientists out in the survey - only 4137 out of 23k respondents. Let's split them by education levels, by adding a flag for higher education and visualise the results.","d03562df":"### How about differences in ways in which their employers use machine learning?\n\nEven though it looks like machine learning is still a new topic in both cases, I am super excited to see the top responses reflecting choice and use in machine learning methods. It is interesting to note that the ML adoption is higher in the responses given by Master's or PhD data scientists (higher % for established ML methods and lower % for experimental or inexisting ML). This finding can suggest that more experienced and mature teams pushed forward the data science adoption curve (another awesome hypothesis that I would love to be able to test on day).","a811f57d":"### And last, how about differences in the tools they use for DS and ML work?\n","776e0a5b":" # Data Scientists - does having a postgraduate (Master's or PhD) make a difference? Data Storytelling with Plotly and Cufflinks\n \n ### Setting the scene\n\nWhenever you look at a generic data scientist job description, in most cases, a higher level education (Master's or PhD) is required. But is this education mandatory for your success in the data science world?\n\nIn this notebook, I am planning to explore the differences in survey responses between the data scientists who hold a Master's or PhD, and the ones who got a Bachelor Degree or lower education. If I have enough time, I will dig deeper into specific differences between Master's and PhD levels, and compare differences with actual job demand (I hope to find  open source data on data scientist job descriptions).\n\n### Intro into the code\nLet's start by importing the packages. I created a few functions to create the plots, as soon as several tasks will be repetitive.","1ce6549e":"### Picking the data scientists\nWe'll have a quick look at the multiple choice data, specifically the column names and first values they take.","7ad76c4e":"### How about the age distribution?\n\nIn both education categories, the 25-29 years old category is the most frequent. However, for Bachelor or lower it is only slightly higher than 22-24 years old (28 % and 27% respectively), while for Master's or PhD it is significantly higher (35.8% vs 13.7%). All in all, we see an older age distribution for Master's or PhD, which makes sense due to the length of time required to complete these degrees. And looking at the chi square test of indenpence, we can also conclude that there are differences in age distributions between the 2 groups.","48a88ca5":"### How about the countries the data scientists are coming from?\n\nIt is very interesting to see the US and India swapping places on the most common country of residence for the data scientists who responded the survey - 27.2% of India-based data scientists have a Bachelor education or lower, compared to only 10% who have a Master's or a PhD. While 25.2% of the American based data scientists hold a Master's or PhD, compared to only 16% who hold a Bachelor or lower education degree. I would like to hypothesize that the market is driving this pattern, and test this hypothesis with data from job ads.","d86b73e9":"### How about differences in salaries?\n\nWhile most of the data scientists in both education types chose not to diclose their salary ranges, the differences between the figures which are disclosed are fascinating. Most data scientists who hold a Bachelor or lower degree earn less than USD 100,000\/year, while the  USD 100-125,000\/year comes second as top percentage (almost 9%) for data scientists who hold a Master's or PhD.","dfadd0fa":"### How about the industry they work in?\n\nUndoubtedly, most data scientists work in the tech industry regardless of their higher level of education. What I found interesting was that only 11.16% of data scientists are students, and 6% of data scientists who hold a Master's or PhD work in Academics or education.","51526903":"### What is the gender distribution in the 2 categories?\n\nAs a woman in Data Science (with a Master's degree), I am happy to see a higher percentage or female data scientists in the higher education category (13.5% Bachelor or lower vs 17.7% Master's or PhD). It is interesting to see, however, that results for male respondents look the other way around (85% hold Bachelor or lower vs 80.1% hold a Master's or PhD ). "}}
