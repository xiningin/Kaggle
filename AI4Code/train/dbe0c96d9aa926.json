This dataset consists of rankings and not actual values. For example, instead of a value for GDP per capita, this dataset will provide a rank to a country (1 being the best). Still though, the dataset is fun to visualize and play around with, just not ideal. \n\nTo begin, we will write all of our necessary imports.","8fd1fa54":"Again, we can make a map of the world and this time show the \"Freedom\" feature.

We can see that social support, GDP per capita, and health are all positively correlated with the countries ranking. This means that countries who ranked highest in the happiness category typically ranked higher in the categories I just mentioned.","ea21841a":"To quickly show the top countries with the highest GDP per capita rank, we can sort the data by the GDP column, them print out the top five."}}
