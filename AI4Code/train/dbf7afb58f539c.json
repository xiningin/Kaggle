Now let's go ahead and add all the feature variables.","b5a5b7c6":"## Step 2: Visualising the Data\n\nLet's now spend some time doing what is arguably the most important step - **understanding the data**.\n- If there is some obvious multicollinearity going on, this is the first place to catch it\n- Here's where you'll also identify if some predictors directly have a strong association with the outcome variable\n\nWe'll visualise our data using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.","3d5dbcd8":"# Multiple Linear Regression\n## Housing Case Study\n\n#### Problem Statement:\n\nConsider a real estate company that has a dataset containing the prices of properties in the Delhi region.

Here we can see that except for `area`, all the columns have small integer values. So it is extremely important to rescale the variables so that they have a comparable scale. If we don't have comparable scales, then some of the coefficients as obtained by fitting the regression model might be very large or very small as compared to the other coefficients. This might become very annoying at the time of model evaluation. So it is advised to use standardization or normalization so that the units of the coefficients obtained are all on the same scale. As you know, there are two common ways of rescaling:\n\n1. Min-Max scaling \n2. Standardisation (mean-0, sigma-1) \n\nThis time, we will use MinMax scaling.","c5e73de3":"We can also visualise some of these categorical features parallely by using the `hue` argument.
