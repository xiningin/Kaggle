It surely will make the model slower.","73821de0":"# Build Attention Model","dc22442a":"# Attention Here!!!\nSo what basically attention is? Why is it used? How is it used?......\nWell, to answer your question regarding attention, we have to **Roll Back in Time** (pun intended). Before the use of Attention in NLP tasks, we relied heavily on `LSTM` which used to **Roll Back in Time** to get the context and sementic of a word in a sentence. So what exactly is rolling back?? As we know that any `RNN` be it `GRU` or even `LSTM`, produces a hiden state `H_i` with every time step. Sate `H_i+1` defined that it has learned from the `Input + H_i`. So the new state has all the **Important** information needed up until now i.e it has all the information learned by previous cells, filtered it and read the new input to produce a new Hidden state which it'll pass to the next cell.\n\nThis is all fun and games until it's something with a deep meaning. LSTMs are good at finding relation when it comes to short sentences but what about a time when you have to find the hidden meaning? Now I got your Attention!!! or you can say we got Attention. Attention is very efficient at finding the hidden meanings of the words as well as the context of the word. A very popular example you'll see everywhere will be this one.\n<img src=\"https:\/\/i.stack.imgur.com\/YNdXP.png\" width=\"350px\">\n\nSo What is this saying?\n\nIt is saying that the `Attention` Mechanism is able to get the part of English language that **it** is used in the context for **Animal** and it has decided to give this decision based after looking at the terms and making decision that  **The,animal,didn't** are more important than the **the,street,too**. So if you had change the last word from `tired -> narrow`, it would hve looked at `the,street,too` more than `the,animal,didn't` because it would have learned that **it** here is used for street but not the animal.\n\nGREATTTT!!!! But how does it do that??? \nWell it is doing by computing **self-attention**. Woah!!! is this even a term? Yes, if you pay enough attention to what you think and do ;)\n\n**NOTE**: The above discussion was to show you the advanced version of Attention called self attention. We'll use the simple attention.
