Conclusion\n\n\n*  We have looked at the rainfall data across India.From the plot we can say India receives heavy rainfall in coastal South West region and in the North East.The Shayadri and the Himalayan mountain ranges obstruct the clouds which cause heavy rainfall in these regions.East and Central India receive moderate annual rainfall.North West India which includes Thar desert receives scanty annual rainfall.\n\n\n*  Highest Rainfall was observed in the year 1961.There were twin drough years in 1965-66.Highest rainfall is received between Jun-Sep which is the monsoon season in India.Oct-Dec is the season of return monsoon and cyclone season in the Bay of Bengal.\n\n\n*  Coastal Karnataka,Arunachal Pradesh,Konkan Goa and Kerala receive highest rainfall.Rajastan,Gujrat,Haryana and Punjab receives low rainfall.Interesting thing is that Punjab and Haryana have high agricultural output despite low rainfall.Their water requirnments are met by rivers and canals.\n\n\n*  We can see Subdivision Arunachal Pradesh shows highest highest difference between Maximum and Minimum rainfall received.Costal Karnataka receives close to 3400 mm of Annual rainfall which is the highest in India.West Rajastan receives the least amount of rainfall.\n\n\n*  Kasargod which is Northern most district of Kerala receives highest annual rainfall.Trivandrum which is the southern most district receives the least amount of rainfall.From this we can clearly make out that rainfall increases as we more from South to North in the State of Kerala.This could be due to proximity of Shayadri mountain ranges in the Northern disctrict of Kerala.\n\n\n\n*  Ladak which is part of Jammu and Kashmir receives 94.6 mm. Ladak and Kargil which receive less rainfall are part of Indian State Jammu and Kashmir.Jaisalmer,Sri Ganganaga and Barmer are part of Rajastan State.\n\n\n\n*  Udupi which is part of Coastal Karnatka receives 4306 mm of Annual rainfall.Upper Siang is part of Arunachal Pradesh.East Kashi hill,Jaintha hills is part of Meghalaya.Tamenglong is part if Manipur.So Districts in Coastal Karnataka and North Eastern states receive heavy rainfall.","cf7e61a2":"## Inspecting the Missing Values in Dataset","24c49bd1":"Ladak which is part of Jammu and Kashmir receives 94.6 mm.
