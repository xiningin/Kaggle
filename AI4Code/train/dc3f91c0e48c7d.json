Because the number of passengers who boarded at Southhampton was highest, the confidence around the survival rate is the highest.  The whisker of the Queenstown plot includes the Southhampton average, as well as the lower bound of its whisker.  It's possible that Queenstown passengers were equally, or even more, ill-fated than their Southhampton counterparts.","fb4e3b56":"<a id=\"t3.\"><\/a>\n# 3.

Feature selection\n\n<a id=\"t4.1.1.\"><\/a>\n### 4.1.1. Recursive feature elimination\n\nGiven an external estimator that assigns weights to features, recursive feature elimination (RFE) is to select features by recursively considering smaller and smaller sets of features. First, the estimator is trained on the initial set of features and the importance of each feature is obtained either through a `coef_ attribute` or through a `feature_importances_` attribute. Then, the least important features are pruned from current set of features.That procedure is recursively repeated on the pruned set until the desired number of features to select is eventually reached.\n\nReferences: <br>\nhttp:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/feature_selection.html <br>","cd54679b":"77% of records are missing, which means that imputing information and using this variable for prediction is probably not wise.
