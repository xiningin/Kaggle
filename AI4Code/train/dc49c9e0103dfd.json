But if you would like to run the code locally on your own computer, you can follow the steps below.\n\n1. Create a Kaggle account (https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/).\n\n2. Download Titanic dataset (https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/titanic\/data).\n    a. Download 'train.csv' and 'test.csv'.\n    b. Place both files in a folder named 'input'.\n    c. Place that folder in the same directory as your notebook.\n\n3. Install Jupyter Notebooks (follow my installation tutorial if you are confused)\n4. Download this kernel as a notebook with empty cells from my GitHub. If you are new to GitHub go the repository folder, click \"Clone or Download\", then unzip the file and pull out the notebook you want.\nRun every cell in the notebook (except the optional visualization cells).\n5. Submit CSV containing the predictions.\n6. Try to improve the prediction by using the challenge prompts which are suitable to your level.\n\n### 1.
