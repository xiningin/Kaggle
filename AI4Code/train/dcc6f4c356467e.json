AI tools are used in these interdisciplinary fields however, in the very recent past everyone used different titles related to a specific application\/or field of data.  'Researcher' or 'Numerical Scientist' of certain data was often used as a professional title.  For individuals coming from an interdiciplinary background, instead of a fast-track Computer Science background, it may be confusing as to what to put on a resume to obtain a desired job.  Postdoctoral researchers from interdiciplinary fields, who actively practice Data Science within a specific application\/domain, have the problem of reshaping their professional profile after finishing a post such that they have the same appearance as their Data Science peers. \n\nUsing a few simple text analysis techniques, to search useful information from the survey to put on a resume is of interest.  If your resume has the correct keywords, one would hopefully be able to obtain the job that they are qualified for.","4aeccf4b":"**Conclusions :** I should be definately practicing Python and SQL, in my area.
