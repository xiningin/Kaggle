I will assume there will be no stars in such far redshift, because the stars lied in the field should came from inside our galaxy. ","6c652e7f":"### IV. Schechter Luminosity Function\n\nWe will make the luminosity function of the cluster. First, we should consider where the luminosity falls. It is around 19.","d737abb6":"Let's check, there should be several field. \n* **ra** is the right ascension of the object, and **dec** is the declination. Those are related to the object position in equatorial coordinate. \n* **bestObjID** is the unique object ID\n* **z** is the redshift value; how far the wavelength shifted. Larger value related to larger distance. \n* **zErr** is the error of the redshift. \n* **psfMag_u, psfMag_g, psfMag_r, psfMag_i, and psfMag_z** is the PSF magnitude of object in UGRIZ color system.

Color Magnitude Diagram\n\nWe will see how red or blue are the galaxies in this cluster, so we could prompt the CMD. Above 2.2, the galaxies could be attributed to elliptical, and below it should be spiral. It was related to bluer star forming region in galaxies which often occured in spiral galaxies. ","b44bf598":"Alright, we got the **redshift as 0.01723**. It was not so accurate, because the redshift data was not complete for all cluster member.

We could filter it with range beyond the known redshift at 0.0179. \n\nBeware that the nearly zero redshift should be belong to close objects such as stars.
