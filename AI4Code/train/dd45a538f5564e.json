They have nearly the same mean, median and variance etc which is not helpful to distinguish the classes.","a6dd7f4c":"#### Observations on Positive nodes Attribute :\n* The distribution of positive nodes attribute is heavily right skewed.\n* So box and whisker plot is plotted to find out possible outliers.

It seems like a Pareto distribution. \n* But from Q-Q plot it is quite clear that it is not a pareto distribution.\n* Even this attribute is seemingly overlapping but people having more than 5 positive auxilary nodes are died in much numbers than the survied ones.
