As described in the data note, all of the galactic objects have been assigned a host galaxy photometric redshift of 0. We can use this information to immediately classify every object as either galactic or extragalactic and remove a lot of potential options from the classification. Doing so results in matching the naive benchmark.\n\nWe find that all of the classes are either uniquely galactic or extragalactic except for class 99 which represents the unknown objects that aren't in the training set.","82ac2beb":"Now write the prediction out and submit it.

We'll include class 99 in both the galactic and extragalactic groups."}}
