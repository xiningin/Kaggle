Our custom distance metric can be expressed in the following equation:\n\n$$ \\begin{align} \\textrm{distance} & = \\textrm{euclidean_distance}_{type, country, rating} \\\\ & + \\alpha \\textrm{ euclidean_distance}_{release\\_year} \\\\ & + \\beta \\textrm{ cosine_dissimilarity}_{bag\\_of\\_words} \\end{align} $$\n\nThe component of the Euclidean distance involving the release year column will be much larger than for the type, country and rating columns, since the latter are one-hot encoded, so we will scale this down by some factor $ \\alpha $ (0.1 by default). We can also control the influence that the bag of words containing genre, cast and director will have with the $ \\beta $ parameter (2 by default).","ac7afc0d":"The recommender generates some cool stuff! If the results look off we can always tune the parameters within our distance-based model. One unfortunate downside is that due to a lazy k-nearest-neighbours approach the recommender is very slow - using an eager learning algorithm would definitely fix this.","c37ba4a5":"We use SKLearn's CountVectoriser to create a matrix of word counts out of all the bags of words in the dataset. From this we can generate a cosine similarity matrix, effectively generating the similarity between each record and every other record in terms of their bags of words (will be between 0 and 1). We convert similarities into dissimilarities by subtracting each similarity from 1.\n\nWe could have used a TF-IDF Vectoriser (term-frequency to inverse-document-frequency), however this would give less weight to words which occur more often in the bags of words - since the bags contain genre categories which are repeated a lot, this is not what we want!","7334f211":"Our strategy is to build a recommender system using a modification of the k-Nearest-Neighbours algorithm on columns that we think would be the most useful. First off, recommendations probably won't be based off of features like runtime, show_id, the date added to Netflix, so we drop irrelevant columns. We also drop the description, but ideally we would pick up keywords from the description using natural language processing to use later.","07feae9b":"We examine the number of NA values. From the results show below they are mostly in the director, cast and country column. We drop these, which unfortunately cuts our dataset size by a hefty margin.","19ce6b8c":"Our task is to build a recommender system for Netflix's huge library of movies and TV shows! How hard could it be...","4c6703ef":"We'll encounter some trouble with the director, cast and listed_in features, since the datapoints are comma-separated values of all the directors, cast members and genres the movie or show is listed in.\n\nWe'll use a **bag of words** technique on these columns. First off only keep the first three values in each of these columns, and discard the rest. We will then assemble a bag of words for each record made up from words in these features. We can calculate the 'distance' between these bags of words later, using cosine similarities.","212a324c":"We one-hot encode the remaining categorical columns (type, country and rating)."}}
