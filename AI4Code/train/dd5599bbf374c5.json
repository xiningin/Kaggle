The store offers in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers come in to the store, have sessions\/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want.\n\nThe company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website.\n\n#### Tasks:\n1.
