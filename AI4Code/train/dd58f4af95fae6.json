To succeed, you will need to import data into Python, answer questions using the data, and generate **bar charts** and **heatmaps** to understand patterns in the data.\n\n## Scenario\n\nYou've recently decided to create your very own video game!  As an avid reader of [IGN Game Reviews](https:\/\/www.ign.com\/reviews\/games), you hear about all of the most recent game releases, along with the ranking they've received from experts, ranging from 0 (_Disaster_) to 10 (_Masterpiece_).\n\n![ex2_ign](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Oh06Fu1.png)\n\nYou're interested in using [IGN reviews](https:\/\/www.ign.com\/reviews\/games) to guide the design of your upcoming game.  Thankfully, someone has summarized the rankings in a really useful CSV file that you can use to guide your analysis.\n\n## Setup\n\nRun the next cell to import and configure the Python libraries that you need to complete the exercise.","aca652d4":"#### Part B\n\nWhich combination of genre and platform receives the highest average ratings?  Which combination receives the lowest average rankings?","56439eb2":"The dataset that you've just printed shows the average score, by platform and genre.  Use the data to answer the questions below.","15955ba9":"## Step 3: Which platform is best?\n\nSince you can remember, your favorite video game has been [**Mario Kart Wii**](https:\/\/www.ign.com\/games\/mario-kart-wii), a racing game released for the Wii platform in 2008.  And, IGN agrees with you that it is a great game -- their rating for this game is a whopping 8.9!  Inspired by the success of this game, you're considering creating your very own racing game for the Wii platform.\n\n#### Part A\n\nCreate a bar chart that shows the average score for **racing** games, for each platform.  Your chart should have one bar for each platform. ","8bb4bd3b":"The questions below will give you feedback on your work. Run the following cell to set up our feedback system.","9e01d317":"## Step 1: Load the data\n\nRead the IGN data file into `ign_data`.

Since your gaming interests are pretty broad (_... you generally love most video games_), you decide to use the IGN data to inform your new choice of genre and platform.\n\n#### Part A\n\nUse the data to create a heatmap of average score by genre and platform.
