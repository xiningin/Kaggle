This effect is additive, so\nthat comparing two people whose glucose level differ by 20 units, the log odds\nof the person being diabetic will be around 0.52 units greater than the\nlog odds for the person having lower glucose level, and the odds for the higher glucose level person will be around `exp(0.52) = 1.68` times greater than\nthe odds for the lower glucose level.\n\n\n\nThe following plot shows the fitted log odds (or logit) probability\nfor the diabeties outcome as a function of pregnancies.
