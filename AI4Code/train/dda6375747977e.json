above plot we can see a slight difference between different levels also in 2nd plot the pass status is almost equal in all levels. So certainly \"parental level of education' does not make any difference.","c3e3c426":"* From above plot we can see that both male and female are quite not good in math\nbut, they excel in both reading and writing.\n","7905adf6":"1. Now here we can see that there are more number of female who in top 20.(Refer the gender and score average in 1st plot)\n2. Even here we can see the lunch is \"standard\" and it does help(confirmed in below analysis).","d08d840b":"1. Now in term of least score, as per \"total score\" as we know diet is important so here it is obviously converse of top scorer and by looking above list many of them had \"free\/reduced\" lunch and hence we can see the result..\n\n2. Also test preparation is important and many of them were not prepared.\n\n\n   * So now to interpret the overall result, diet and test preparation were the key to get better score and yes some of them obviously know that preparation is a must or they might don't even know about the lunch, that it does help and it is worth exploring such strategy.\n   \n<br>\n<br>\n* That's all folks, this is my 1st kaggle notebook so if there is any mistake or improvement to be done then please share it with me.\n\n **_Email : purohitvikram77@gmail.com_**\n \n#### Thank you.","9717417d":"## Let us now see our data by sorting on different cases like\n\n1.

In this too we can see more number of female who are in top 20, so as per this female are quite good in writing\/reading and even math. (It is as per the data so please don't mind boys :P)\n\n2. Even here we can see diet helped to get better score, hence we can say diet is crucial in term of scoring better.","81928257":"1. Here by looking at the output we can see that its female who topped in math and male and female have approx equal ratio in top 20.\n2. Also we can see at in this top 20 list based on top math scorer had a \"standard\" lunch type insted of \"free\/reduced\", so here we can say that Diet is important to top in math.\n3. There is one interesting thing here is that the top scorer in math did not prepared for it, I mean is that possible? Yes maybe because math is about how you know the concepts and remembering formulaes. It maybe the case that the data might be taken just before giving the test because we cannot say that they did not learn well, it just tell us about the preparation before the test.","6bb17b35":"* Looking at the about 2nd plot it is really a strange behaviour as we can see that students who were prepared and not-prepared\n  have equal.\n* Not only that, even in the 1st plot it says that the average does not have a large difference.\n* Owing to this we can say that it either the test was easy or this data might only say about preparation before test and not about how well versed the students are.","f990bf8a":"There is no missing\/null data present. That's good!","5daa5a33":"* Looking above in the first plot wee can see that there is not quiet a difference between the groups, as seen it shows a gradual increment as the down.\n* But in the second plot we can clearly see that \"group C\" has most number of student passed but it can be misleading because we do not know the ratio of P\/F can varry and we can misinterpret the above 2nd plot.\n* I have already plotted with respect to ratio below where we can see that ratio is equal and hence race\/ethnicity is not a factor which is correlated with pass status.","59d48536":"1. This can be our overall interpretation to verify on bases of \"total score\" and here as well we can see that diet is important.\n2. As seen in above individual top 20 scorer we have seen that female scored better and we can verify it here.\n","def1e17e":"## Let us now see Visually which factor affects the scores(individually) \nlet us start with\n\n1.
