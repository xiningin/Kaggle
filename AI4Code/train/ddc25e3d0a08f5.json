One of the major forms of pre-processing is to filter out useless data. In natural language processing, useless words (data), are referred to as stop words.\n### Stop-words\nStop Words: A stop word is a commonly used word (such as \u201cthe\u201d, \u201ca\u201d, \u201can\u201d, \u201cin\u201d) that a search engine has been programmed to ignore, both when indexing entries for searching and when retrieving them as the result of a search query.\n\nWe would not want these words to take up space in our database, or taking up valuable processing time. For this, we can remove them easily, by storing a list of words that you consider to stop words. NLTK(Natural Language Toolkit) in python has a list of stopwords stored in 16 different languages.\n\n### Tokenizing \nTokenization is the process by which big quantity of text is divided into smaller parts called tokens.\n These tokens are very useful for finding such patterns as well as is considered as a base step for stemming and lemmatization.\n \n### Lemmatize\nLemmatization is the process of grouping together the different inflected forms of a word so they can be analysed as a single item. Lemmatization is similar to stemming but it brings context to the words. So it links words with similar meaning to one word.","3026dbcd":"## U.S.A. makes more number of wines than all the next top 4 producers","d13c3ef4":"## Recommendation top 5 wines based on the current preferences","c246a002":"## On average best testing wines can be found in England followed by India and austria","8185bc76":"## Top 5 countries that produce most number of wines","e538589a":"## After all the pre-processing(removing stop words, tokenizing, lammetizing) our data looks something like this","c521f217":"## Let us find out which of all the countries make best wines based on the point "}}
