The burned area is highly skewed with a value of +12.84 ha and huge kurtosis value of 194 ha.\n2.

Rain\nRainfall only in these months:aug,july and mar which is even very less in amount.\n\nMonths receving no rainfall is more of a dangerous conditions with respect to rainfall prospective.\n\n2. Temp\njune,july,aug,sep,oct has high temp\n\n3. Wind\nwind is low in jan,feb,july,sep,oct\n\n2. Relative Humidity\nwe see humidity is also low in sep oct nov dec\n\n1. DC value high in july,aug,sep,oct more dry in that month\n2. DMC value high in july ,aug,sep but not in oct\n3. FFMC value high above 90 in aug,july,sep,oct \n4. ISI value high in june july aug,sep \nForest Fire Prediction\n1. Month having no rainfall is more prone to catch forest fire. \n2. When temp is increasing the moisture content of all 3 different types of fuel is reduced in the same month, so more dangerous conditions have occured in the months of july,aug,sep,oct from temp prospective \n3. Also we can see that DMC and DC value have no significant relations with wind and Relative humidity columns \n4. Months having low humidity is more prone to catch forest fire.","da2ae15b":"Observations:\n\n1.Previously we had observed that August and September had the most number of forest fires.

From above analysis we can conclude that due to less rainfall the temp increses which affect all the FWI codes.\n\nAlso there is no significant changes in DMC and DC codes due to wind as they are depth layer of fuel codes.\n\n2.Also majority of the forest fires do not cover a large area most of the damaged area is under 50 hectares of land \n\n3. high number of the forest fires occur in the month of August and September.\n\n4.
