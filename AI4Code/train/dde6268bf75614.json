Heatmap\n### Which neighbourhood of the city are the hotspots for crime?\n\nWe can't work with the full dataset as not all coordinates were logged correctly but we can still get a good idea which neighbourhoods are the crime hot-spots. Vancouver CBD being the most noticeable, Kitsilando, Kerrisdale, Sunset(South Vancouver) and Marpole. \n<br><\/br>\n\nAttempted to acquire data of population within Vancouver city (no solid dataset is available), I was trying to draw up a correlation of population density to the crime per location.

Have they decreased? \n\n<p>There is a mixture of events per crime. At a glance it can be perceived that the majority of the crimes are decreasing over the years. Studying it closer the crime though to have decrease seems to be on the rise again. To determine this, I would have to look at other variables that influence the each crime from weather, arrests, sales, construction in the area, etc.  \n<br><\/br>\n\nContinuing with the data set I can make some theoretical correlations, comparably of when one crime increases another  may decrease. For example, has Police presence decreased, are more people buying bicycles or merely finding it easier to travel to work with a bicycle, thus the drop of vehicle theft has decreased and why Bicycle theft may have increased. Awareness campaigns of people rights has maybe increased over the years and notably \"Offence Against a Person\" has decreased. <\/p>","603f661a":"# Introduction\n\n<p>\n\nMy approach to this project was to explore the data firstly, then draw out the distinct questions that come to mind a first glance of the data:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Has crime changed over the years?

I started off by adding some Styling (CSS) to my project. I then proceed with my code to import all the libraries needed. \n\nThe next approach was to prepare the data and in doing so I needed to identify any anomalies and missing data. Cleaning the data by filling in defaults of the blank rows in each column as well as enriching the data by adding new columns. \n\nI then was ready to explore and visualize the dataset, along with implementing the algorithm techniques.\n\n# Technique Implementation\nIn any analysis, a great guide or roadmap keeps things on track and defined the final outcome. \nA summary list of roadmap goals:\n\n- Exploring Data set\n- Heatmap\n- Decision Tree","e1583332":"### Using the same parameters and excluding the Hour there is a 20% chance of accuracy on my selection.","a6bc2fd9":"### Decision Tree Classifier with criterion gini index","06440195":"### Is there a trend of crime per year on all crime?\n\n<p>\n<ul>\n    <li>At first glance, you can see that crime is increasing as the heapmap gets darker moving to 2016<\/li>\n    <li>Homicide, Mischef, Vehicle collisions(All collisions) crimes look constant on the heatmap of the years<\/li>\n    <li>Studying the heatmap, 2010-2013 seem to display the lowest crime years <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/p>","fa34c292":"## Reference\n\nAnon., n.d.
