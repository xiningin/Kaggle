Instead of blank values and the club names the player is loaned to, we will use Boolean values telling us whether the player is on loan to another club or not.\nLastly, we will use the column contract_valid_until to generate contract_expiry_in, so that we use can use the number of years left on a player\u2019s to assess his value.","d2259c5d":"After this, we will spit the data into training and test so that we have a test dataset for our trained model to assess its performance later on a data that it has never seen before.

We will build our solution based on the assumption that these prices for the players are highly curated and based on the research and analysis of experts of this domain.","ab7bcdc1":"Next, we ought to perform some data pre-processing steps like filling missing data, categorizing and normalizing the columns. With the fast.ai library, this is rather easy, we specify the pre-processing methods in a list, and use it later at the time of creating our fast.ai DataBunch for training.","055ea474":"Football (Soccer) in the modern times has become much complicated, than it ever was. For clubs all around the world, it\u2019s not just about playing your heart out in the field, but also perform well in the transfer markets, to snap up the right talent and players for their sides, at the right price. Over the past few years we have observed a serious inflation in player values and some exuberant release clauses (price inserted in a player\u2019s contract with his\/her current club for which he\/she can be bought by another club).\nAs a result of this, a many clubs end up paying a lot more for a player whose talent and performances on the field fail to justify his\/her price tag. A similar problem is faced by the club selling a player, where they fail to realise his\/her potential, and let him\/her go for a price which was way less than the actual price they should have asked for.\nWe shall try to solve this as a regression problem using Deep Learning. We will be making use of the fast.ai\u2019s tabular module to predict a player\u2019s value based on his\/her skill and personality attributes.\n","73ce188b":"First, we\u2019ll put all categorical fields in a list cat_var, and all continuous fields in another list cont_var . These two variables will be used to construct the fast.ai DataBunch.","de14b6cc":"In recent years, Deep Learning models and architectures have gained a lot of traction while dealing with image data, as well as, for providing solutions to NLP based problems. This has been a result of some excellent and ground breaking research work that we have seen over the years in the field of Deep Learning. On the other hand, traditional tree-based models like RandomForrest and XGBoost have maintained their stronghold and have proved to be really successful and efficient when dealing with Tabular (Structured) data, especially in regression problems.\nToday, we will be looking at an approach to apply Deep Learning on Tabular data in order to solve a regression problem using FastAi.","258ccf65":"### Assumption","50b11141":"#### Data","fe10e08a":"#### Data Pre-Processing"}}
