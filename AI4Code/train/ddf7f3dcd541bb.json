Across all the tested areas students with standard lunch performed better than students with free\/ reduced lunch. The exact reason for each students lowered performace is unknown but less money could mean less resources. Students with free\/reduced lunch may have a job outside of school which might take them away from thier studies.","ed8bdd86":"# Student Performance in a Nutshell\nIt can be difficult for all students to do their best in school with all these outside factors affecting thier performace. Through exploring this dataframe I was able to get a clear idea of what are some of these factors are by comparing students scores based on a set criteria. \n\nI am new to Kaggle and would like to get better at data analysis through these projects. Please give feedback, suggested improvements and share!","39d8c96b":"Here is a peak at a dataframe with data about a student, their background and how they performed on this exam. I mentioned that students have access to tutors which could help them perform better. The closest to that would be the column *test pereparation course*.","3411ff67":"# Exam Score with Test Preparation Course","321309ba":"# What Affects Student Performance?\n\n![image.png](attachment:image.png)","41d5a034":"From this we see that there is a trend between the level of parents education and the child school perfomance on the exams. Finally, to test whether the the income of a student has an impact on their exam performace.","bd4ad3b0":"The box plots above show a trend in scores between those who completed a test preparation course and those who did not. On the right you can see that the mean of the students scores are much higher than those on the left by almost 10 points for all subjects. This shows that students that get outside help to prepare for school are more likley to do better in school.","3e97e837":"# Student life at home\n\nThere is also the possibility that it may not be the student that is the cause for their grade. It could be their parents or at home responibilities due to financial problems. Taking a look the the dataframe we see there is a column for parents level of education and their lunch. What this does is give us a general idea of what the students financial situation is and whether it has a correlation with the exam score.","df6e56ca":"Every student has the chance to do great in high school and score high on their exams, so why don't they? There are teachers there to help them in and out of class, their peers can give them a hand, and there is even tutors available for parents to hire. With all these reasons why they should perform great that still is not the case."}}
