With over 20 features to prepare data for machine learning, PyCaret creates a transformation pipeline based on the parameters defined in setup function. It automatically orchestrates all dependencies in a pipeline so that you don\u2019t have to manually manage the sequential execution of transformations on test or unseen dataset.

PyCaret allows you to go from preparing data to deploying models within seconds from your choice of notebook environment.\n\nIn comparison with the other open source machine learning libraries, PyCaret is an alternate low-code library that can be used to replace hundreds of lines of code with few words only. This makes experiments exponentially fast and efficient. PyCaret is essentially a Python wrapper around several machine learning libraries and frameworks such as [scikit-learn](https:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/), [XGBoost](https:\/\/xgboost.readthedocs.io\/en\/latest\/), [Microsoft LightGBM](https:\/\/github.com\/microsoft\/LightGBM), [spaCy](https:\/\/spacy.io\/), and many more.\n\nPyCaret is simple and easy to use. All the operations performed in PyCaret are sequentially stored in a Pipeline that is fully orchestrated for deployment. Whether its imputing missing values, transforming categorical data, feature engineering or even hyperparameter tuning, PyCaret automates all of it.

Deploy Model\nOne way to utilize the trained models to generate predictions on an unseen dataset is by using the predict_model function in the same notebooks \/ IDE in which model was trained. However, making the prediction on an unseen dataset is an iterative process; depending on the use-case, the frequency of making predictions could be from real time predictions to batch predictions.
