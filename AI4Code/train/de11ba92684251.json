With the existing information we've shown, we can't tell. However, random forests have a very clever trick called out-of-bag (OOB) error which can handle this (and more!)\n\nThe idea is to calculate error on the training set, but only include the trees in the calculation of a row's error where that row was not included in training that tree. This allows us to see whether the model is over-fitting, without needing a separate validation set.\n\nThis also has the benefit of allowing us to see whether our model generalizes, even if we only have a small amount of data so want to avoid separating some out to create a validation set.\n\nThis is as simple as adding one more parameter to our model constructor. We print the OOB error last in our print_score function below.","e17ccb44":"Random forest classifier only take entirely numeric dataframe.
