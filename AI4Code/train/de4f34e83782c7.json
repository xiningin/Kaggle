As the nodes increases, the chance of survival drop drastically.","369e7c18":"**Observations:**\n* The pair plot is drawn to see the relation between all variable to make any classification decision.From the above plot, it can be observed that the data points pertaining to both survivers and non-survivers (irespective of combination of the plot) are mixed together, therefore it is not possible to classify with regular observation and requires further analysis using univariable. Therefore, We can not find \"lines\" and \"if-else\" conditions to build a simple model to classify the patients who survive or not.","62ed0f74":"**Observations:**\n* There is a lot of overlapping which signifies that the age of patient is not a good variable for classifying the dataset.","27080583":"**Observations:**\n\n* The percentage of the patient who survived 5 or more than 5 years after operation is 73.5%.","320abad8":"**There are four different columns, i.e. 'Patient_Age', 'Operation_year', '# of tumors', 'Survival_status'. Let's understand what can we infered from them.**\n\n1. First column, i.e. 'Patient_Age', corresponds to Age of the patient at the time of operation.\n2. Second column, i.e. 'Operation_year', corresponds to the age of patient's year of operation.\n3. Third column, i.e. '# of tumors', corresponds to the number of tumors found in the body of the patient.\n4. Fourth column, i.e. 'Survival_status', corresponds to the survival of the patient.\n\n**If status is equal to 1 then it means that the patient survive 5 years or more after operation. Whereas status is equal to 2 then it means that the patient died within 5 years of the operation.**"}}
