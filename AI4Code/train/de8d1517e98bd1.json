In this data set, we removed the identifiable information about the school districts. We also used an open source tool ARX (Prasser et al. 2020) to transform several data fields and reduce the risks of re-identification. For data generalization purposes some data points are released with a range where the actual value falls under. Additionally, there are many missing data marked as 'NaN' indicating that the data was suppressed to maximize anonymization of the dataset.\n\n**district_id** : The unique identifier of the school district\n\n**state** : The state where the district resides in\n\n**locale** : NCES locale classification that categorizes U.S. territory into four types of areas: City, Suburban, Town, and Rural. See Locale Boundaries User's Manual for more information.\n\n**pct_black\/hispanic** : Percentage of students in the districts identified as Black or Hispanic based on 2018-19 NCES data\n\n**pct_free\/reduced** : Percentage of students in the districts eligible for free or reduced-price lunch based on 2018-19 NCES data\n\n**countyconnectionsratio** : ratio (residential fixed high-speed connections over 200 kbps in at least one direction\/households) based on the county level data from FCC From 477 (December 2018 version). See FCC data for more information.\n\n**pptotalraw** : Per-pupil total expenditure (sum of local and federal expenditure) from Edunomics Lab's National Education Resource Database on Schools (NERD$) project. The expenditure data are school-by-school, and we use the median value to represent the expenditure of a given school district.","6d1f0839":"# Univariate Analysis","2a15cbf9":"rows and column in district dataset","4fd89cbf":"columns in dataset","81fbf0ce":"dataset summary"}}
