Any thoughts on this weired phenomenon? \n\n[NOTE]: Need to perform second digit test also, which will be updated in this notebook soon\n","0a515477":"# What is Benford's Law and how it is used for Fraud Detection?\nA recent episode in a Netflix show called 'Connected' talked about pattern followed by natural numbers called **Benford's Law**. According to this strange law, the probability of a digit 'd' appearing in a set of natural numbers is equal to log(1+1\/d) with base 10. In other words, given a dataset and first digits of numbers in a column, if that dataset is not manipulated, then most likely, the probability of the occurrence of digits is [30.1, 17.6, 12.5, 9.7, 7.9, 6.7, 5.8, 5.1, 4.6] for 1-9 digits respectively.\n\nThis law is utilized in catching financial frauds and to raise red flags if deemed suspicious. It's mind-boggling that everything that involves numbers and not handcrafted follow Benford's Law.\n\nForensic accountant Mark Nigrini has developed five-digit tests. Below are the tests listed in the order they will be performed:\n* The first digit test\n* The second digit test\n* The first two digits test\n* The first three digits test\n* The last two digits test\n\nThe first and second digit tests are done to determine if the dataset appears reasonable. In this notebook, only the first digit test is performed on Covid-India data.\n\nIn order to determine if the first digits of dataset conform with Benford's Law, I used **Chi-Square** test and the critical value of chi-square distribution for p=0.05 and 8 degrees of freedom (#categories -1) is 15.51. So if the value of chi-square exceeds 15.51, we can conclude the distribution doesn't follow Benford's Law!\n\n","446d5c87":"## Distribution of Deaths for each state","be79d7c7":"A typical Benford distribution looks like below plot:","1e4664ad":"Since the chi_square test came out to be positive, it means that the above dataset conforms with Benfords law for first digits.
