It will be tedious for the customer to make selection. Here comes 'reviews' where customers who have already got that product leave a rating after using them and brief their experience by giving reviews. As we know ratings can be easily sorted and judged whether a product is good or bad. But when it comes to sentence reviews we need to read through every line to make sure the review conveys a positive or negative sense. In the era of artificial intelligence, things like that have got easy with the Natural Langauge Processing(NLP) technology.**\n\n## Acknowledgements:\n1.

This would be helpful for the organization to understand Customer feedbacks.**\n\n**Webportals like Bhuvan get vast amount of feedback from the users. To go through all the feedback's can be a tedious job. You have to categorize opinions expressed in feedback forums. This can be utilized for feedback management system. We Classification of individual comments\/reviews.and we also determining overall rating based on individual comments\/reviews. So that company can get a complete idea on feedback's provided by customers and can take care on those particular fields. This makes more loyal Customers to the company, increase in business , fame ,brand value ,profits.**\n\n## Objectives of Project\n\n1. Reviews Preprocessing and Cleaning\n2.
