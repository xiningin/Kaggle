Members of each team are stored in a list. The Coach is the first name in the list, the captain is the second name in the list, and other players are listed after that. \nThese lists are stored in another list, which starts with the best team and proceeds through the list to the worst team last.  Complete the function below to select the **captain** of the worst team.","2ff06517":"## 3.\n\nThe next iteration of Mario Kart will feature an extra-infuriating new item, the *Purple Shell*.

For example, the following list represents a party with 7 guests, in which Adela showed up first and Ford was the last to arrive:\n\n    party_attendees = ['Adela', 'Fleda', 'Owen', 'May', 'Mona', 'Gilbert', 'Ford']\n\nA guest is considered 'fashionably late' if they arrived after at least half of the party's guests. However, they must not be the very last guest (that's taking it too far). In the above example, Mona and Gilbert are the only guests who were fashionably late.\n\nComplete the function below which takes a list of party attendees as well as a person, and tells us whether that person is fashionably late.","926644cd":"# Python solved Exercises","ae984da5":"## 4.\n\nWhat are the lengths of the following lists?
