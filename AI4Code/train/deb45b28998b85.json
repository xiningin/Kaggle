This adds to the theory that people are taking more turns because they are trying harder.","7793593e":"Games are typically evenly matched. Most games occur around 1500 elo but are positvely skewed. This is likely because players who tend to play alot of matches could be higher skilled players.","b55cd24b":"Draws are longer games. This makes sense as draws will often drag out the game with little chance of mating their opponent.","0be55690":"Higher Rated games seem to have weak correlation with having more turns. Perhaps higher rated players are less likely to make game altering blunders. Maybe lower rated players get beat quickly by players who are sandbagging from higher ranks. It could also be the case that higher rated players take the game more seriosuly and will draw out games longer in attempts to win."}}
