It is worth looking at the documentation of the specific ML model to understand how preprocess the data. In general, the steps we are going to go through prepare the data for the Regression models are :\n 1. **Choose variable which you want to predict and features to train the model on:**\n Simply speaking 'xs' are the model features and 'y' is the output we are going to predict\n \n 1. **Split the dataset into train and test data:**\nOn the train data we can train model. Test data helps us measure how accurate the model is. There are different accuracy metrics for regression models, for example **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** or **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**. In this tutorial we will stick to **MSE** as it is a quite popular choice for regression models. More information about the accuracy metrics can be found in Sklearn [documentation](https:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/model_evaluation.html#regression-metrics).\n\n 1. **Scale\/Normalise the data**:\nWe need to normalise all of the numerical features so each of them have the same significance during the model training. For example, is feature x_1 has values of magnitude 1000 and feature x_2 of magnitude 10, x_2 won't contribute much to the training of the model.
