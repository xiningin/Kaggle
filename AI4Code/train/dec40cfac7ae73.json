To reduce biased analysis result, the research question is further divided to include the analysis for both naturally ventilated buildings (NV) and air-conditioned buildings (AC). Discussions are made to explain the rationale of not considering impact of \u201cSeasons\u201d and not including building \u201cHeating strategy\u201d in the analysis. \n\n<font size=\"3\"> With data cleaning being completed, the project moved on to analyze the impact of climates on building occupants\u2019 thermal comfort perception. Ambient environmental conditions and building features are taken into account for both NV and AC buildings. Note that due to the limited sample size, the accuracy of building features related analysis is compromised. It is observed that occupants generally have a greater tolerance of higher temperatures in naturally ventilated buildings as compared to air conditioned buildings due to the differences in capacity to regulate and enable building occupants to experience temperature ranges in each of the buildings. There is a need to study each climate more in-depth given the differences in air temperature range, relative humidity levels and air velocity speeds that are experienced in outdoor environments in comparison to within building environments which sets differences in thermal comfort perception expectations given the different cooling strategies that are involved. \n\n<font size=\"3\"> Lastly, a machine learning model, The Random Forest Algorithm, is used in an attempt to predict individual thermal comfort in relation to geographical location. Accuracy of prediction achieved only around  47.87% after refinement. Feature importance of the prediction variables are analyzed to better understand why the model has such a low accuracy. It is found that geographical location related variables such as climate classification, air velocity, monthly air temperature and relative humidity have a relatively higher weightage in ensuring a higher prediction accuracy. In comparison, other personal characteristics such as clothing, metabolism rate, weight and height of the participants as well as cooling strategy are not as significant.\n\n<font size=\"3\"> For future studies, it is suggested that the data set could be more complete so that in-depth analysis can be carried out. Categories such as clothing level, metabolism rate, occupants\u2019 activity level, usage of fans and provision of window openings are found to be largely missing in the existing data set. The inclusion of more data from other climate types would also be helpful in getting more insights. With a more complete dataset, the impact of personal characteristics and building features shall be re-evaluated. The machine learning model could potentially achieve a higher accuracy as well in a more complete dataset.\n","c65c46a3":"<font size=\"3\">Similarly, the same 3 climates can be observed for thermal sensation section.\n\n<font size=\"3\">However, the comparisons can not be made for humid subtropical and temperate oceanic due to insufficient data for people who select either to open or close the door in the AC building.\n\n<font size=\"3\">In hot semi-arid climate, more people will choose to keep the door closed, and they will open the door to allow exchange of indoor and outdoor temperature when they are experiencing slightly cool in AC envrionment.","23200c05":"<font size=\"3\"> While comparing the most comfortable temperature ranges in rooms of different cooling strategies, **we observe that people in naturally ventilated spaces report higher tolerance of 1-2C compared to air conditioned rooms.** This trend can be seen in the two graphs plotted for Cool-summer mediterannean and Hot-arid climates.This could also be dependent on occupant preferences in relation to their understanding of the cooling strategy of the building itself. With a greater temperature range experienced in naturally ventilated buildings as show in previous sections and occupants citing warmer thermal sensations, they have then developed the habit of tolerating higher temperatures as compared to air conditioned buildings whereby temperatures are subjected to better regulation. **Thus, the cooling strategy in relation to geographical location do make a difference to the thermal comfort perception that is experienced by its occupants.**","a7d4e9ec":"<font size=\"3\">**[BPS5229] Group 1 Team members**\n<font size=\"3\"> <br> Chew Zheng Xiong (Lawrence) - A0167003R\n<font size=\"3\">  <br>Gu Xin - A0114470R\n<font size=\"3\"> <br> Liu XinWei - A0160081U\n<font size=\"3\"> <br>Tanya Talwar - A0199072W\n<font size=\"3\"> <br> Zeng Mufan - A0142730R","5e0d3bdb":"<font size=\"3\"> **Thermal Preference distribution in relation to Air Conditioned and Naturally Ventilated Buildings**  \n<font size=\"3\"> Majority of the participants with up to 57.55% of them in air conditioned preferred no change.

Ambient environment factors such as **temperature, relative humidity and air velocity** are important variables that impact the occupants thermal comfort perception. This is due to the differences in an individual's experience of thermal comfort perception between the outdoor environment and within a building (Zhang et al., 2017). Especially in air conditioned buildings, there is a tendency for occupants to expect a drastic difference in thermal comfort perception that enables them to experience greater levels of comfort within the building itself (Wu et al., 2019).

This can be seen from the range of studies such as Jowkar et al. (2020) which discusses the influence of acclimatisation differences on thermal comfort perception within University buildings in Scotland and England. Also, Lam et al. (2019) which reports the effects of acclimatisation on the thermal comfort experienced within Hot-Humid areas in China. These studies have thoroughly analysed the effects and variables of acclimatisation within their study groups, however, a larger scale study of adaptaion in different geographical contexts in relation to the thermal comfort perception has not been engaged. \n\n<font size=\"3\"> **Thus, our group has selected the ASHRAE Global Thermal Comfort Database II and we conduct an exploratory analysis on the dataset to assess if a person's geographical location has a significant influence on their comfort preferences.**\n    \n<font size=\"3\"> In our dataset, we have responses of a large number of surveys conducted in indoor spaces where people have stated their thermal preferences and comfort levels among many other sensations. Each response is accompanied by a description of the indoor environment in which the survey is conducted. In order to compare thermal comfort levels, we need people subjected to similar environmental factors at the time of survey. \n    \n<font size=\"3\"> People in indoor spaces ventilated by air conditioners sit in very controlled environments as compared to those in naturally ventilated buildings. Thus, we intend to address the differences in building cooling strategy in relation to thermal comfort perception with the following research questions: \n\n<font size=\"3\"> **1. Do people, in different geographical locations, have different thermal comfort preferences in naturally ventilated buildings?**\n\n<font size=\"3\"> **2. Do people, in different geographical locations, have different thermal comfort preferences across all air-conditioned spaces?**\n\n<font size=\"3\"> In Brager et al.'s (1993) study, assessment of thermal comfort, preference and sensation were given a scale as seen in the image below. In this notebook, thermal comfort perception encompasses both thermal comfort and thermal sensation. Thermal comfort is defined as the state of mind expressed by an individual's satisifaction of the environment whereas thermal sensation is the state of mind expressed by an individual in evaluating the environment (Zhang & Zhao, 2009) Based on the survey responses, we observe that a similar index was utilised in the dataset as well. Thus, our group will be frequently reffereing to following scales as well. \n\n![Capture.JPG](attachment:8af213d8-de32-4db8-9ab8-5c40f547e074.JPG)","1e7dc502":"<font size=\"6\"> **Limitations**  <a id='LM'><\/a>\n\n<font size=\"3\"> 1. Missing of data has been the major limitation in this study. One example is that within Air Conditioned building data frame among a total of 17 climate classifications, only 10 contains thermal comfort, in which 2 of the climates actually contain less than 15 response from occupants. Analysis is constrained to only certain climate types as either data are missing from other climate or that the reliability of the sample being rather weak. Another example is the missing of data that are related to building features such as fans and windows. For the analysis of naturally ventilated building, it would be necessary to take into account the usage of fans as well as provisions of windows. These are considered two major factors affecting occupants\u2019 thermal sensations for a naturally ventilated building. Other missing data, including occupants\u2019 clothing level, metabolic level, activity level and so on, also restrict more in-depth study being conveyed.\n\n<font size=\"3\"> 2. The data set shows no clarity on whether the cooling and heating strategies were in use while the survey was conducted. There are rows in which both air conditioning and mechanical heating had values which seems unlikely in real life. There are also rows where values of 'Heater' column are 1.0 (meaning heater being turned on) along with mentioning that the air-conditioned is used as cooling strategy. Therefore, for the purpose of this project, it is assumed that buildings with air-conditioning as cooling strategy are having their air-con being turned on at the point of survey. This assumption implies that the study excluded survey results for buildings that are located in a cold weather region.\n \n<font size=\"3\"> 3. The data frame does not mention whether multiple participants had been surveyed in the same building. If yes, were them being surveyed at the same time or across different time period and different seasons. A biased analysis result could be obtained if too many surveys were conducted to multiple participants in a particular building within a short time period. This information may be required to shed light on the PMV and PPD columns in the data.\n\n<font size=\"3\"> 4. Qualitative measure like thermal sensation should be recorded as per the defined categories instead of floats. Thermal sensation index is defined as integers but within this data set, it can be observed that many responses obtained are in decimal number. \n","dd29cd52":"<font size=\"5.5\"> **IIa. Thermal Sensation within Air Conditioned Buildings**  \n\n<font size=\"3\"> Following the evaluation of the data, we can see that the adaptability and thermal sensations felt at certain temperatures are different for each climate. Hot semi-arid has the largest range of temperature in terms of air temperature (16 degree Celsius to more than 35 degrees Celsius) and for participants feeling thermally neutral (around 17 to 33 degrees Celsius). This is in contrast with climates such as Cool-summer Mediterranean and Warm-summer humid continental where a shorter range is recorded for both air temperatures (19 to 28 degrees Celsius) and for participants feeling thermally neutral (between 22 to 27 degrees Celsius).","915c52d5":"<font size=\"3\"> Our model accuracy stands at about 46.39% which is not very high nor accurate in this case. To further validate the model, the Out of Bag score is also used.\n\n<font size=\"3\"> The Out of Bag (OOB) score is a way of validating the Random Forest Machine Learning model to show how representative is the validation test set. Whereby The OOB score is computed as the number of correctly predicted rows from the out-of-bag sample (Schonlau et al., 2020). In our case, our model's OOB score is not particularly high. \n\n<font size=\"3\"> Thus, there is a need to improve the model using hyper-parameters. This is done through GridSearch CV which is a library function which loops through the pre-defined hyper-parameters we have below to fit based on our model and the training set as an input. This enables us to select the best parameters that is listed to improve the model accordingly.","7db0f79d":"<font size=\"3\">**Building Feature 1 - Fan**  \n<font size=\"3\">After setting cooling strategy to air conditioned and dropping unkonwn state of fan operation (N.A data), we have results for 4 climates, namely humid subtropical, tropical wet savanna, hot semi-arid and monsoon-influenced humid subtropical. Usually, people feel equally comfortable either with fan turned on (=1) or off (=0).

In addition multiple studies have used Random Forest algorithm for data-driven prediction of thermal comfort in various case studies involving clothing, gender specific parameters and vehicle cabins (Farhan et al., 2015; Chaudhuri et al., 2018; Warey et al., 2020).

It is worth noting that both of these climates have a relatively small temperature range as compared to the climates with higher thermal comfort recorded. Although both climates do have a low velocity of below 0.3m\/s that may have contributed to the lower thermal comfort, Subtropical Highline actually has the lowest wind velocity amongst the climates but has recorded a high thermal comfort level.
