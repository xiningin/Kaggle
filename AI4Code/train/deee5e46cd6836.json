Although the order book and trade data for the target cannot be shared, we can still present the realized volatility calculation using the feature data we provided. \n\nAs realized volatility is a statistical measure of price changes on a given stock, to calculate the price change we first need to have a stock valuation at the fixed interval (1 second). We will use weighted averaged price, or WAP, of the order book data we provided.","ead88ede":"The private leaderboard will be built against the real market data collected after the training period, therefore the public and private leaderboard data will have zero overlap.

Therefore, sometimes when someone wants to do a trade in a stock, they check the order book and find someone with counter-interest to trade with. \n\nFor example, imagine you want to buy 20 shares of a stock A when you have the order book in the previous paragraph. Then you need to find some people who are willing to trade against you by selling 20 shares or more in total. You check the **offer** side of the book starting from the lowest price: there are 221 shares of selling interest on the level of 148. You can **lift** 20 shares for a price of 148 and **guarantee** your execution. This will be the resulting order book of stock A after your trade:","01157f22":"![order_book2](https:\/\/www.optiver.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/OrderBook4.png)\n\nIn this case, the seller(s) sold 20 shares and buyer bought 20 shares, the exchange will match the order between seller(s) and buyer and one trade message will be broadcast to public:\n\n- 20 shares of stock A traded on the market at price of 148.","ede7653d":"![order_book_3](https:\/\/www.optiver.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/OrderBook5.png)","6287c0eb":"#### A glimpse of our trading floor","5f125cc1":"**bid\/ask spread**\n\nAs different stocks trade on different level on the market we take the ratio of best offer price and best bid price to calculate the bid-ask spread. \n\nThe formula of bid\/ask spread can be written in below form:\n$$BidAskSpread = BestOffer\/BestBid -1$$","65f59e76":"# Order book statistics\nThere are a lot of statistics Optiver data scientist can derive from raw order book data to reflect market liquidity and stock valuation.

A fair book-based valuation must take two factors into account: the level and the size of orders. In this competition we used weighted averaged price, or WAP, to calculate the instantaneous stock valuation and calculate realized volatility as our target. \n\nThe formula of WAP can be written as below, which takes the top level price and volume information into account:\n\n$$ WAP = \\frac{BidPrice_{1}*AskSize_{1} + AskPrice_{1}*BidSize_{1}}{BidSize_{1} + AskSize_{1}} $$\n\nAs you can see, if two books have both bid and ask offers on the same price level respectively, the one with more offers in place will generate a lower stock valuation, as there are more intended seller in the book, and more seller implies a fact of more supply on the market resulting in a lower stock valuation.\n\nNote that in most of cases, during the continuous trading hours, an order book should not have the scenario when bid order is higher than the offer, or ask, order. In another word, most likely, the bid and ask should never be **in cross.**\n\nIn this competition the target is constructed from the WAP. The WAP of the order book snapshot is 147.5317797.","811fa735":"You could insert an order to buy at 148. However, there is nobody currently willing to sell to you at 148, so your order will be sitting in the book, waiting for someone to trade against it. If you get unlucky, the price goes up, and others start bidding at 149, and you never get to buy at all. Alternatively, you could insert an order to buy at 155. The exchange would match this order against the outstanding sell order of one share at 149, so you buy 1 lot at 149. Similarly, you'd buy 12 shares at a price of 150, and 7 shares at 151. Compared to trying to buy at 148, there is no risk of not getting the trade that you wanted, but you do end up buying at a higher price.","8dc3a3d8":"# Submission","f8eef1e3":"Looping through each individual stocks, we can get the past realized volatility as prediction for each individual stocks.","058eaf54":"# Order book\nThe term order book refers to an electronic list of buy and sell orders for a specific security or financial instrument organized by price level.

That is why investors love liquidity, and market makers like Optiver are there to provide it, no matter how extreme market conditions are.","a04d89ab":"A commonly known fact about volatility is that it tends to be autocorrelated. We can use this property to implement a naive model that just \"predicts\" realized volatility by using whatever the realized volatility was in the initial 10 minutes.\n\nLet's calculate the past realized volatility across the training set to see how predictive a single naive signal can be.","7392f725":"# Log returns\n\n**How can we compare the price of a stock between yesterday and today?**\n\nThe easiest method would be to just take the difference. This is definitely the most intuitive way, however **price differences** are not always comparable across stocks. For example, let's assume that we have invested $\\$$1000 dollars in both stock A and stock B and that stock A moves from $\\$$100 to $\\$$102 and stock B moves from $\\$$10 to $\\$$11. We had a total of 10 shares of A ($\\$1000 \\ \/ \\ \\$100 = 10$) which led to a profit of $10 \\cdot (\\$102 - \\$100) = \\$20$ and a total of 100 shares of B that yielded \\$100. So the price increase was larger for stock **A**, although the move was proportionally much larger for stock B.\n\nWe can solve the above problem by dividing the move by the starting price of the stock, effectively computing the percentage change in price, also known as the **stock return**. In our example, the return for stock A was $\\frac{\\$102 - \\$100 }{\\$100} = 2\\%$, while for stock B it was $\\frac{\\$11 - \\$10 }{\\$10} = 10\\%$. The stock return coincides with the percentage change in our invested capital.\n\nReturns are widely used in finance, however **log returns** are preferred whenever some mathematical modelling is required. Calling $S_t$ the price of the stock $S$ at time $t$, we can define the log return between $t_1$ and $t_2$ as:\n$$\nr_{t_1, t_2} = \\log \\left( \\frac{S_{t_2}}{S_{t_1}} \\right)\n$$\nUsually, we look at log returns over fixed time intervals, so with 10-minute log return we mean $r_t = r_{t - 10 min, t}$.\n\nLog returns present several advantages, for example:\n- they are additive across time $r_{t_1, t_2} + r_{t_2, t_3} = r_{t_1, t_3}$\n- regular returns cannot go below -100%, while log returns are not bounded"}}
