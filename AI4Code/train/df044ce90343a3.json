A DAG is a special data structure that looks like a family-tree.  A Career Path DAG contains the path a City employee would take for promotions.\n\n### Solution:\n\nI offer this two-part strategy:\n\n**Part 1** a prototype app that finds bias words using a Natural Language Processing (NLP) \n\n**Part 2** proof of concept scripts that create a CSV file with text gathered from the Job Bulletins and Career Paths.

Only 2% of the words in Job Bulletins may be biased.  Only 12% of the time biased words are used.\n\nHaving led projects in 27 countries (so far), I study how language affects team productivity.  Teams thrive in collaborative environments with clear goals.  When staffing teams, I write job descriptions using short, simple words so that all candidates can read them, even \"non-native\" English speakers who didn't learn English as their first language.  \n\nAdditionally, I realize that some team members respond negatively to gender-bias words.  Some job candidates told me that they don't like a \"competitive\" work environment.  Steering clear of bias can be difficult.  Fortunately, Gaucher, Friesen, and Kay researched gender bias in job advertisements and made a list of gender-coded words. They published this list in \"Evidence That Gendered Wording in Job Advertisements Exists and Sustains Gender Inequality\" in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, July 2011, Vol 101(1), p109-28.  I used this list to evaluate the City of Los Angeles Job Bulletins.  \n\nText analysis can be fast and accurate because the original Job Bulletins are processed directly.  There is no \"middle-man\" converting them to a database first.  I was able to go beyond proof of concept and conduct an automated review looking for biased words that might discourage job applicants.  The City of Los Angeles scored very well.
