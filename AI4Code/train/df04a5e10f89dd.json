You just got some contract work with an Ecommerce company based in New York City that sells clothing online but they also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers come in to the store, have sessions\/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want.\n\nThe company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website. They've hired you on contract to help them figure it out! Let's get started!\n\nJust follow the steps below to analyze the customer data (it's fake, don't worry I didn't give you real credit card numbers or emails).","772a362f":"\nThis is tricky, there are two ways to think about this: Develop the Website to catch up to the performance of the mobile app, or develop the app more since that is what is working better. This sort of answer really depends on the other factors going on at the company, you would probably want to explore the relationship between Length of Membership and the App or the Website before coming to a conclusion!\n","5c59b68d":"**Check the head of customers, and check out its info() and describe() methods.**","a6c2bf57":"## Training the Model\n\nNow its time to train our model on our training data.\n\n** Using LinearRegression **","49484eb5":"## Predicting Test Data\nNow that we have fit our model, let's evaluate its performance by predicting off the test values!\n\n** Use lm.predict() to predict off the X_test set of the data.**","dda45bfc":"**Do you think the company should focus more on their mobile app or on their website?**","8e005fe9":"** Use model_selection.train_test_split from sklearn to split the data into training and testing sets.

Or maybe that doesn't even really matter, and Membership Time is what is really important.  Let's see if we can interpret the coefficients at all to get an idea.\n\n** Recreate the dataframe below. **"}}
