You can refer to previous Jigsaw competitions for data that might be useful to train models. But note that the task of previous competitions has been to predict the probability that a comment was toxic, rather than the degree or severity of a comment's toxicity.\n\n#### What did you not understand about this process?\nWell, everything provides in the competition data page. I've no problem while working on it. If you guys don't understand the thing that I'll do in this notebook then please comment on this notebook.\n\n#### What else do you think you can try as part of this approach?\nWhile we don't include training data, we do provide a set of paired toxicity rankings that can be used to validate models.\n\n","23261b67":"#### What are you trying to do in this notebook?\nThis notebook is to visualise the text data to see and identify some patterns in the text data which might help us in differentiating between less_toxic and more_toxic comments.\nThis notebook attempts to perform EDA on the Jiggsaw Toxic Severity Rating dataset. The focus in this competition is on ranking the severity of comment toxicity from innocuous to outrageous.\n\n#### Why are you trying it?\nIn this competition you will be ranking comments in order of severity of toxicity. You are given a list of comments, and each comment should be scored according to their relative toxicity. Comments with a higher degree of toxicity should receive a higher numerical value compared to comments with a lower degree of toxicity.\nIn order to avoid leaks, the same text needs to be put into same Folds.\nFor a single document this is easy, but for a pair of documents to both be in same folds is a bit tricky.\nThis simple notebook tracks pairs of text recursively to group them and try to create a leak-free Fold split."}}
