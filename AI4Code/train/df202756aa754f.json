\u2018Maverick\u2019 Mitchell and his Radar Intercept Officer LTJG Nick \u2018Goose\u2019 Bradshaw fly the F-14A Tomcat aboard USS Enterprise (CVN-65). During an interception with two hostile MiG-28aircraft (portrayed by a Northrop F-5), Maverick gets missile lock on one, while the other hostile aircraft locks onto Maverick's wingman, Cougar. While Maverick drives off the remaining MiG-28, Cougar is too shaken to land, and Maverick, defying orders, shepherds him back to the carrier. Cougar gives up his wings, citing his newborn child that he has never seen. Despite his dislike for Maverick's recklessness, CAG \u2019Stinger\u2019 sends him and Goose to attend Topgun,[6] the Naval Fighter Weapons School at Naval Air Station Miramar.At a bar the day before Topgun starts, Maverick, assisted by Goose, unsuccessfully approaches a woman. He learns the next day that she is Charlotte \u2018Charlie\u2019 Blackwood, an astrophysicist and civilian Topgun instructor. She becomes interested in Maverick upon learning of his inverted maneuver with the MiG-28, which disproves US intelligence on the enemy aircraft's performance. During Maverick's first training sortie he defeats instructor LCDR Rick \u2018Jester\u2019 Heatherly but through reckless flying breaks two rules of engagement and is reprimanded by chief instructor CDR Mike \u2018Viper\u2019 Metcalf. Maverick also becomes a rival to top student LT Tom \u2018Iceman\u2019 Kazansky, who considers Maverick's flying \u2018dangerous.\u2019 Charlie also objects to Maverick's aggressive tactics but eventually admits that she admires his flying and omitted it from her reports to hide her feelings for him, and the two begin a romantic relationship. During a training sortie, Maverick abandons his wingman \u2018Hollywood\u2019 to chase Viper, but is defeated when Viper maneuvers Maverick into a position from which his wingman Jester can shoot down Maverick from behind, demonstrating the value of teamwork over individual prowess. Maverick and Iceman, now direct competitors for the Topgun Trophy, chase an A-4 in a later training engagement. Maverick pressures Iceman to break off his engagement so he can shoot it down, but Maverick's F-14 flies through the jet wash of Iceman's aircraft and suffers a flameout of both engines, going into an unrecoverable flat spin. Maverick and Goose eject, but Goose hits the jettisoned aircraft canopy head-first and is killed. Although the board of inquiry clears Maverick of responsibility for Goose's death, he is overcome by guilt and his flying skill diminishes. Charlie and others attempt to console him, but Maverick considers retiring. He seeks advice from Viper, who reveals that he served with Maverick's father Duke Mitchell on the USS Oriskany and was in the air battle in which Mitchell was killed. Contrary to official reports which faulted Mitchell, Viper reveals classified information that proves Mitchell died heroically, and informs Maverick that he can succeed if he can regain his self-confidence. Maverick chooses to graduate, though Iceman wins the Top Gun Trophy. During the graduation party, Viper calls in the newly graduated aviators with the orders to deploy. Iceman, Hollywood, and Maverick are ordered to immediately return to Enterprise to deal with a \u2018crisis situation\u2019, providing air support for the rescue of a stricken ship that has drifted into hostile waters. Maverick and Merlin (Cougar's former RIO) are assigned as back-up for F-14s flown by Iceman and Hollywood, despite Iceman's reservations over Maverick's state of mind. The subsequent hostile engagement with six MiGs sees Hollywood shot down; Maverick is scrambled alone due to a catapult failure and nearly retreats after encountering circumstances similar to those that caused Goose's death. Upon finally rejoining Iceman, Maverick shoots down three MiGs, and Iceman one, forcing the other two to flee. Upon their triumphant return to Enterprise, Iceman and Maverick express newfound respect for each other. Offered any assignment he chooses, Maverick decides to return to Topgun as an instructor. At a bar in Miramar, Maverick and Charlie reunite.\")\n","8fcbf0b9":"Same as above except using only the movie data, without the additional news data","ae45880b":"# 1.

Bag of Words Model\nUse the TF-IDF matrix (split into training and test) from the pre-processing step to train a logistic regression binary classifier.","0226cf0a":"# Final Notes\nAfter all that, none of the fancy machine learning techniques improved the relatively straightforward Bag of Words logistic regression.  All of the model architectures I tried were about 7% less accurate than the simple model, even when incorporating GloVE embeddings and additional training data from news articles. A reminder, perhaps, that complexity and cutting edge is not necessarily always better, especially in light of the interpretability of the Bag of Words model, highlighted by the above list of words associated with comedy and drama synopses.","ff1c4358":"Get the weights out of the Bag of Words model to see what words are most predictive of dramas and comedies","8c25b09c":"Quick sanity check to make sure that the tokenizer worked properly","de7117d8":"# 3.

As such, it attempts to solve a typical text classification problem, albeit perhaps a tricky one, since defining humor can be difficult even for humans..  Classifications and synopses are taken from Wikipedia;  supplemental training data is taken from the news category dataset, which contains headlines and short descriptions of Huffington Post articles, in addition to categories that include comedy.  I apply a simple Bag-of-Words approach, a CNN-based approach, and a hybrid CNN-LSTM approach to the problem.  I also use a few standard text-processing steps to pre-processing the data.  The simplest approach turns out to be the best; none of the more complicated approaches I tried outperformed the Bag-of-Words logistic regression model.  \n\n### Outline\n\n1.
