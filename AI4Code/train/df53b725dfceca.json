We do this by looking at the differences between consecutive interest rates.","d7d895dc":"The reason why interest rates matter is because of exponential growth. Small changes in interest produce large differences in savings over time. If you save \u00a31000 over 30 years then a 10% rate generates a return that is 47 (yes 47!) times bigger compared to your return with a 1% interest rate.
