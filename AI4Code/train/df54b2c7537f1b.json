Conclusions\n\nFirst of all I'd like to say that I'm not an expert in politics or economy, it's a subject that is interesting for me and I once I'm a beginner, I made this kernel to practice my code and tried to draw some conclusions. Said that:\n\nThrough this EDA we could see that along the years, countries tend to make polices for economic freedom aiming trades, property rights and sound money. Goverment size does not affect how economically free a country is, as I personally thought it'd be. So it's not about the size of a goverment, it's about the regulations made that allows economic freedom.\n\nWe also could observe that there is a positive correlation between countries with a high human development with countries economically free. The example of Chile that I took is one of those cases. Since the mid 70's Chile transformed it's economy by adopting these policies. Unfortunately the HDI started being mesured  in 1990 so we can't see how was Chile's index before these economics changes.\n\nOf course that's not the only reason that makes the HDI of country high, but it's interesting to see the relation of these features.","6ae98354":"Given that these are the top 15 countries in 2016, we can't see a large difference among them. The only observation that can be made is that most of these countries are from Europe or Asia, and we only have one from Africa (Mauritius) and one from South America (Chile).\n\nBut have these countries always been economically free like this?","cdfcefcf":"## Dealing With Strings\n\nThe datasets are going to be merged by Country name, but we can see that in some country names they appear differently from one dataset to the other. So here, we're going to remove everything after the name of the country.","78b5a9ea":"Among the BRICS, all countries have an index between 6.0 and 7.0 except for Brazil that stays below 6.0.\n\nThere is no oscillation for Russia until 1990 probaly because it was one of those Null values filled by the median.","f0b979d2":"Not all countries on the top 15 are the same but we can spot some like, Hong Kong, Australia, Switzerland and some others.","066a5e9a":"<a id=\"hdi_econ\"><\/a>\n# 8.

I even ran two kernels in R to practice EDA and Machine Learning. \n\nBut realized that most of data scientists work with Python, and it was much more used than R. So I've decided to learn and check the advantages of the language. \n\nSo I'm running my first kernel in Python to take some insights and to practice Python a little.\n\nOnce I'm a begginner in data science, I really appreciate if you can tell me whether the analysis is pursuing for a correct logical, the topics I can improve or what else I could do using this dataset.","c33fe598":"As we did with the Economic Freedom dataset, first let's check the data","e932a709":"## Cleaning Data ","f55be3bf":"### Correlation between INDEX and SCORE","e9ef6786":"Using only the five main features, we can see that most of them are strong correlated to the final score.

These contrasts can stimulate debate about government policy priorities.\" (Human Development Reports)\n\n\"The Human Development Index (HDI) is a summary measure of average achievement in key dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life, being knowledgeable and have a decent standard of living.

About the Dataset\n\nThe Economic Freedom of the World Report made by Fraser Institute is the world\u2019s premier measurement of economic freedom, ranking countries based on five areas: size of government, legal structure and security of property rights, access to sound money, freedom to trade internationally, and regulation of credit, labour and business.\n\nThe institute divides and subdivides the characteristics for assessing the economic freedom of a country. The main ones are:\n\n<b>Area 1: Size of Government<\/b> \u2014 As government spending,\ntaxation, and the size of government-controlled enterprises\nincrease, government decision-making is substituted for\nindividual choice and economic freedom is reduced.\n\n<b>Area 2: Legal System and Property Rights<\/b> \u2014Protection of\npersons and their rightfully acquired property is a central\nelement of both economic freedom and civil society.\nIndeed, it is the most important function of government.\n\n<b>Area 3: Sound Money<\/b> \u2014 Inflation erodes the value of rightfully\nearned wages and savings. Sound money is thus essential\nto protect property rights. When inflation is not only high\nbut also volatile, it becomes difficult for individuals to plan\nfor the future and thus use economic freedom effectively.\n\n<b>Area 4: Freedom to Trade Internationally<\/b> \u2014 Freedom to\nexchange\u2014in its broadest sense, buying, selling, making\ncontracts, and so on\u2014is essential to economic freedom,\nwhich is reduced when freedom to exchange does not\ninclude businesses and individuals in other nations.\n\n<b>Area 5: Regulation<\/b> \u2014 Governments not only use a number\nof tools to limit the right to exchange internationally, they\nmay also develop onerous regulations that limit the right to\nexchange, gain credit, hire or work for whom you wish, or\nfreely operate your business.","ceead975":"## Which Are The Least And Top Economically Free Countries?\n\nThe dataset has the index for each country since 1970 to 2016.
