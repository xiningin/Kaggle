Import libraries and load dataset","d63f7ba8":"# What is Exploratory Data Analysis?\n\nExploratory Data Analysis or EDA is used to take insights from the data. Data Scientists and Analysts try to find different patterns, relations, and anomalies in the data using some statistical graphs and other visualization techniques. Following things are part of EDA :\n\n - Get maximum insights from a data set\n - Uncover underlying structure\n - Extract important variables from the dataset\n - Detect outliers and anomalies(if any)\n - Test underlying assumptions\n - Determine the optimal factor settings\n","796b64f0":"# 2.Check for missing values","dcfae829":"# Table of Contents\n\n1.

How does highway_mpg affects price?","2a73e53d":"# Introduction\nExploratory Data Analysis is a set of techniques that were developed by Tukey, John Wilder in 1970. The philosophy behind this approach was to examine the data before building a model. John Tukey encouraged statisticians to explore the data, and possibly formulate hypotheses that could lead to new data collection and experiments. Today Data scientists and analysts spend most of their time in Data Wrangling and Exploratory Data Analysis also known as EDA. But what is this EDA and why it is so important? This article explains what is EDA and how to apply EDA techniques to a dataset.","58dccbd2":"#### The average count between 50-100 is 50 and it is positively skewed.","be30068e":"# Why EDA is important?\n\nThe main purpose of EDA is to detect any errors, outliers as well as to understand different patterns in the data. It allows Analysts to understand the data better before making any assumptions. The outcomes of EDA helps businesses to know their customers, expand their business and take decisions accordingly.","e9b76e55":"### Positive Correlation\n\n   - Price \u2013 wheel_base, length, width, curb_weight, engine_size, bore, horsepower\n   - wheelbase \u2013 length, width, height, curb_weight, engine_size, price\n   - horsepower \u2013 length, width, curb_weight, engine_size, bore, price\n   - Highway mpg \u2013 city mpg\n\n### Negative Correlation\n\n   - Price \u2013 highway_mpg, city_mpg\n   - highway_mpg \u2013 wheel base, length, width, curb_weight, engine_size, bore, horsepower, price\n   - city \u2013 wheel base, length, width, curb_weight, engine_size, bore, horsepower, price\n\n#### This heatmap has given us great insights into the data.\n\n#### Now let us apply domain knowledge and ask the questions which will affect the price of the automobile.","5bac6950":"#### Now we can observe that the \u2018?\u2019 symbols have been converted into NaN form.

Visualizing the missing values\n\nWith the help of heatmap, we can see the amount of data that is missing from the attribute. With this, we can make decisions whether to drop these missing values or to replace them. Usually dropping the missing values is not advisable but sometimes it may be helpful too.","b195cb4a":"# 5. Asking Analytical Questions and Visualizations\n\nThis is the most important step in EDA. This step will decide how much can you think as an Analyst. This step varies from person to person in terms of their questioning ability. Try to ask questions related to independent variables and the target variable. For example \u2013 how fuel_type will affect the price of the car?\n\nBefore this let us check the correlation between different variables, this will give us a roadmap on how to proceed further.","8305e708":"#### There are null values in our dataset in form of \u2018?\u2019 only but pandas are not reading them so we will replace them into np.nan form.","5f2a1314":"#### We can see price decreases with an increase in higway_mpg.\n\n#### Let us check the number of doors.","5203ddbc":"#### Now observe that there are many missing values in normalized_losses while other columns have fewer missing values.
