The tests that are currently present as a standrad for the indurstry are expensive, destructive and time consuming. Predictions from current tests are a roundabout representation of the actual concrete mixes used in the field. There is an impending need for a technqiue to predict strength non-destructively which could be cheaper and faster. The modelling of the behaviour of concrete is difficult becuase of mutliple factors affecting it, which includes mix proportion, admixtures, superplastcizers added, water\/cement ratio and so on. The use of AI is being done as a way to model concrete behaviour in a more effecient way. \n\n**Dataset Source**:\nThe dataset is from https:\/\/archive.ics.uci.edu\/ml\/datasets\/Concrete+Compressive+Strength\n\n**Metric**:\nSpliting of the dataset would be done into train and test data. Train data would be used for training the model to predict strength of concrete. Test data would be used to evauluate and validate the performance of the model. \n","b20561ab":"The observations and comments that can be made from the above box plot is as follows:\n\n1:The data in cement, slag, ash doesn't appear to have any significant outliers.\n\n2: The data from water, superplastic, age, and strength appears to have some outliers, amidst them the age data has a long extension of the plot suggesting the highest amount of outliers amongst all of data columns mentioned.\n\n","b90479b4":"The observations and comments that can be made from the distribution plots and skewness degreee data is as follows:\n\n1: The strength data is normally distributed.\n\n2: Water and cement data seems to be very near to being normally distributed. \n\n3: The data from age column as seen from box plot had a lot of outliers which is re-affirmed here with the distribution plot having very lengthy un-symmetrical extension beyond its mean value."}}
