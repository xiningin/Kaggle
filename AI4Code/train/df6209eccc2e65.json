customers tends to churn more as compared to young ones.And we have already seen in the correlation plot that Age was related to Exited Status\n* **Graph 2-** By looking at the credit Score it is hard to tell whether customer tends to churn or not because the behaviour are almost same for both.So Credit Score can't be considered as one of the factor\n* **Graph 3-** Balance shows somewhat same behaviour except that customers with high balance tends to churn little more\n* **Graph 4-** Estimated Salary shows same behavoiur for both status\n* **Graph 5-** Tenure also shows similar behaviour

This can be done by promoting digital platform by giving them fist time joining offers, any kind of cashback etc.\n\n* Germany have high churn percentage as compared to France and Spain so bank should focus on Germany to identify what are the facilities that are present in France and Spain like number of ATM machines, number of bank branch, locality of bank etc. and sholud be incorporated in Germany in order to enhance retention\n\n* Customers churn is high for aged ones reason might be that the aged person looking for some kind of good retirement plan or high return on fixed deposits which others banks might be offering so in this case we suppose to target such customers and offer them better offers in order to retain them\n\n* We should also focus on getting reliable customers because we have more than 68% of our customers whose credit score are less than 700 (ideal credit score is 700 and above)\n\n* Bank should offer more than 1 products to their customers because customers have churned less if they have more than 1 products\n\n* Bank should engage more with female customers by giving them facilities like door step KYC, welcome goodies for joining bank etc.\n\n* Bank should also focus on customers who tends to churn without taking their entire balance from bank","abaecc5e":"# **Exploratory Data Analysis**","a8211458":"**Highlights from above graphs**\n\n* **Grpah 1-** Majority of our customers are having Credit Score less than 700(ideal credit score >= 700),i.e we have more number of non-reliable customers\n* **Grpah 2-** Age of our customers seem right skewed whiich means we have few customers whose age are more as compared to majority of customers also we have more numbers of young customers ranging from 29 to 40 years of age\n* **Grpah 3-** Majority of our customers have bank balance normally distributed except around ~3600 customers have Zero bank balance\n* **Grpah 4-** Estimated Salary of our customers are uniformly distribute means we have around same number of customers for all different estimated salary.","bdc94237":"## Let's Start","abb2d842":"Age shows some correlation with Exited status i.e age would be one of the factors that drive this process however we'll see this in details later in this notebook when we explore Age with Exit status.Also there is no correlation between independent variables i.e no multicollinearity","e118bd21":"# **Descriptive Analytics**\nDescriptive Analytics basically the analysis done on the historical data in this case we have 10k customers data that's been collected over a period of time.Descriptive Analytics is useful in order to understand the trend from past.","2a5f6dd1":"We have successfully dropped all three columns mentioned above<br>\n**NOTE** : Data cleanup is not required on this file as we don't have null values,no outliers etc so now we are directly moving to EDA part.","edad47fb":"# Visualizations\nAny analysis begins with visualization as it's hard to find any kind of a trend by just looking raw data as it's recommended to do visualization.<br>\n","8b428929":"![](https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/800\/0*dzmm3qresODlScte)\n\n\nIn this notebook we are going to see what do we mean by **customer churn** and why is it important to identify the important factors that drives this process.Also how can we improve our process to reduce churn and how to predict such customers in early stages.\n\nFirst of all **Customer churn is an inactivity or disengagement of customers with our current business**.We are going to identify the factors that drives this process through EDA also known as **Exploratory Data Analysis**.Also we'll be applying Machine learning algorithm in order to identify such candidates in eary stage so that we could engage with them to enhance retention.","f9dc36f5":"**Insights from above graphs**\n* **Grpah 1-** Majority of our customers are Male\n* **Grpah 2-** We have more number of customers from France, we have almost same number of customers from Germany and Spain\n* **Grpah 3-** Majority of our customers have a good relationship with bank ranging from 1 to 9 years\n* **Grpah 4-** Most of our customers are using one of our bank products followed by 2 products\n* **Grpah 5-** Almost 70% of bank customers are using credit card\n* **Grpah 6-** surprise to see that we have almost same number of customers in terms of digitally active and inactive ","36579738":"# Continuous Variable Exploration with respect to Exit Status ","8ab98e88":"**Insights from above graphs**\n* Let's understand how to interpret mosaic plot -
