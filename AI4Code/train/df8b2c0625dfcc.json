This also makes our above reports for US over the month of Feb unreliable.\n\nNow, let's look at the latest confirmed cases across US states.","368e9ba8":"As can be seen from the above chart, the disease started spreading fast since 1st Feb 2020. \n* There was a huge burst of disease on Feb 13th. As per the news reports, the jump in new cases\u2014more than 14,800 on Feb 13th in China at the epicenter of the outbreak\u2014is due to a change in the criteria for counting diagnoses of the virus. For more information, please read the article [Hubei cases classification](https:\/\/time.com\/5783401\/covid19-hubei-cases-classification\/)\n* There is a second wave of exponential increase in early May. \n\nOn the brighter side, the infected people also started recovering at a fast rate since mid Feb. \n\n\n# Number of countries infected over time. \nNow, Let's try visualize the number of countries impacted over the time. ","6a0f9d4b":"As per the [Wolrd Health Organization](https:\/\/www.who.int\/health-topics\/coronavirus), Coron Viruses (CoV) are a family of viruses that cause illnesses ranging from common to sever diseases. The Novel CoronoVirus(nCoV or COVID-19) is a new strain that had not been previously identified in the humans. The World Health Organization first reported the outbreak of Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) on Decemeber 31, 2019. You can follow the updates on COVID-19 outbreak from [WHO](https:\/\/www.who.int\/emergencies\/diseases\/novel-coronavirus-2019).\n\nToday we'll analyze the COVID-19 outbreak around the world. How is the outbreak spreading, and how are the infected people recovering around the world. \n\n## Outbreak analysis\nLet's start with the latest stats on the COVID-19 outbreak.","3d3e35ab":"In case of S. Korea, the growth factor was high in early Feb. Since the counts were still low, it started to slow down. However, since mid Feb, there was exponential growth until mid March. Since, then the outbreak transitioned from exponential growth to linear growth during the later half of the month of March. But, it is still growing linearly.","cb1b8fa7":"# COVID-19 spread in countries post 100th confirmed case\nCOVID-19 is spreading rapidly. Let's analyze how's it spreading in different parts of the world. To analyze that we'll consider the start point as the 100th confirmed case for each countries so that we can compare how did each country get affected after the 100th confirmed case. Please visit [Coronavirus tracked: the latest figures as the pandemic spreads | Free to read](https:\/\/www.ft.com\/coronavirus-latest) for more detailed growth analysis for each country.","67eafa49":"Let's look at top countries with severe outbreak of COVID-19 and the countries next in line due to proximity to affected contries and high count of confirmed cases.","b5cad747":"The incubation period for COVID-19 is around 2 weeks. As such, even after the lockdown the count of confirmed cases would still grow for 2 weeks. However, the growth should start slowing down. However, as can be seen in the above charts for Italy, Spain, and France. The post lockdown growth is still high. It seems like the lockdown hasn't been effective so far for these countries in stopping the outbreak of COVID-19.\n\n# Saturation prediction\nLet's analyze how different countries are doing with respect to the outbreak. Are they still in the exponential growth stage or showing signs of slow down. To analyze these we need to acquaint ourselves with the following terms.\n* Growth factor: It is the ratio of new cases today over the new cases yesterday. This measures if the spread of COVID-19 is increasing or looks like it is slowing down.\n* Inflection point: The spread of a disease in general follows a logistic curve(S-curve). This point is the central point on the growth curve where the growth factor is equal to 1. Below this inflection point, the curve would grow exponentially with >1 growth factor. Beyond this curve, the growth factor slows down with less than 1.\n\nLet's start with analyzing South Korea and China as they are way ahead in their outbreak journey with a clear saturation in their curve. We'll then compare how other countries are doing in their outbreak with respect to logistic curve."}}
