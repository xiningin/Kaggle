See your improvement: [Kaggle progression](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/progression)\nI am also kinda new in Kaggle, but I'm loving it & thinking to invest more time on Kaggle. When you run more of your Data Science Python or R program on Kaggle, and get upvoted, your account will be progressing from Kaggle novice to contributor -> Expert -> Master -> Grandmaster.\nIt's a great feeling to be acknowledged from my learning. Let's grow together. :)","cbb6e75b":"# How to learn Data Science? Use Kaggle","2d5e25b0":"### 3. Run models in the same platform \nWhile writing this article, I am writing a small Python program (on the same webpage) to explore the possibility of survivals of women compared to men in Titanic disaster. See below: **female** has 74% chances of survival whereas **male** has only 18%. This does make sense since rescue operations prioratize children and women as in Titanic dataset.","2175f107":"### 4. Share \nOf course, you will run your Data Science project in Kaggle, & share it with us. When you run your code in local machine, nobody sees your outputs!","42abe324":"### 1. Interact with similar-minded people: Community\nKaggle is surely one of the best community for novice and expert Data Scientist around the world.\nUndeniably, you can learn *Bayesian Inference* from this amazing [GitHub blog](https:\/\/camdavidsonpilon.github.io\/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers\/), but after a few hours of learning, you might lose track. What if you can ask related questions to someone who knows Bayesian thinking? Just after typing *Bayesian*, Kaggle gives me the following, so **38 users** might know Bayesian, & I might ask them questions. Or, post Bayesian related questions in Kaggle with a hope that someone will answer me.","155e8cd4":"### 5. No installation: Python & R\n**Python & R** are the two MOST dominating programming language in Data Science. I personally dont care about C or whatsoever programming language or your skill on those. Why? Because if I need to learn only one language for my Data Science journey, its Python (or if my need is more statistical toolbox focused, then R). \nKaggle is the platform that comes with Python & R preinstalled. Salute to Kaggle.\n\nNote: I am an enthusiastic user of Kaggle and not affiliated with it by any means."}}
