The first guess is initialised with random values. The goodness or badness of the guess is measured with the loss function.

It is not an alternative to actually taking the time to learn. What it aims to do is help someone get started fast and gain intuitive understanding of the typical steps early on.","95433ba7":"There's much to be improved but we'll leave it here for now and take this further in future examples.","23888b50":"## Step 0 Understand the problem\nWhat we're trying to do here is classify sign language alphabets."}}
