The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19. In COVID-19, 'CO' stands for 'corona,' 'VI' for 'virus,' and 'D' for disease. Formerly, this disease was referred to as \u201c2019 novel coronavirus\u201d or \u201c2019-nCoV\u201d.\n    There are many types of human coronaviruses including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses. COVID-19 is a new disease, caused be a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans. The name of this disease was selected following the World Health Organization (WHO) best practice external icon for naming of new human infectious diseases.\n    \n\n# **SOURCES:**\n\nCDC\n\nRespective State Websites\n\nApmresearchlab\n\n\n# Links\nhttps:\/\/www.cdc.gov\n\nhttps:\/\/www.apmresearchlab.org\/covid\/deaths-by-race\n\n\n# Libraries\nNumpy -  Support for Pandas and calculations\nPandas - For dataset handeling\nSeaborn - For visualization\nmatplotlib - For visualization\n","456ea495":"# **Objective of this Notebook**\n  \n\nBefore Starting:\nThis is our first Kaggle notebook being published. If you liked this kernel please don't forget to upvote the project, this will keep me motivated to other kernels in the future. I hope you enjoy our deep exploration into this dataset. Let's begin!\n\n   \"Analysis of African American Covid Death Rate\" , presents different scenarios(population spread,normal death rate ,covid death rate etc... )   between African americans in comparison with White Americans and other major races in USA.We have tried to show the facts through the available data collected from CDC and respective State data and came up with top 10 states which are highly affected by COVID.We would further like to study and analyse why these states are far more affected than others among the African American communities and also why African Americans have higher incidences.\n   \n   The novel coronavirus has claimed more than 80,000 American lives through May 11. Data about the race and ethnicity of the deceased is known for about 8 in 10 of these deaths, which we have compiled from Washington D.C. and the 39 states that are releasing these statistics.  The existing data reveals deep inequities by race, most dramatically for Black Americans.\n   \n   Health Departments all over America are reporting that African Americans have a higher incidence of covid-19 positive cases and deaths .This might be because they are part of front line essential workers,who have to be on job supporting the communities all over USA amid Covid-19 health crisis.\n   \n   While most of the Americans are ' under stay at home 'order. African American community ,who contribute to 25% of this workforce during crisis  are making sure that we get our food deliveries,grocery deliveries ,they are also working as grocery store employees,as gas station employees,part of postal services ,they are also major part of transportation workers.They are also working in health care and their numbers are in millions ranging from home care nurses to health aids, working in hospitals and pharmacies across America.Does this make them highly vulnerable to Covid-19 ?One can certainly think so and we want to analyse further on this topic.\nYour comments and suggestions are welcome.","af7814b5":"**The below table shows the trend among African American COVID deaths with their 2018 population and deaths.**","7177e1d0":"**The below graph shows the Top 10 states with highest Covid-19 Death percentage among African American community in comparison with their population.**","29418a0b":"**Similarly,we have compared the trend among Whites COVID deaths with their 2018 population and deaths.**","3b3c1765":"**The below bar graph shows the COVID 19 death for African Americans is highest among all other races in USA per 100,000.**","dee4f743":"**The below pie chart shows the African American population spread by Region across USA for the year 2018.**","74aa08e9":"**The below pie chart gives a population spread comparison by Race for the year 2018 (latest data available on CDC)**"}}
