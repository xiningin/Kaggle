The `make` function appears to be a wrapper around the `Environment` initialization function, validating inputs.  The command takes four parameters:\n* `environment` - this can be a string for one of the folders in in `kaggle_environments.envs` (https:\/\/github.com\/Kaggle\/kaggle-environments\/tree\/master\/kaggle_environments\/envs) or an instance of an Environment.

I will spend more on this time later.\n* `steps` \\[optional\\] - this is a `list` of game states to fastforward the game board, if empty, the initial state is used by default.  Potentially, this could be used to implement the [\"5-in-a-row\"](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Connect_Four#5-in-a-Row) variant.\n* `debug` \\[optional\\] - this is a flag that determines whether the engine will print various messages to console during the call to `step()`; used by the private function `__debug_print`","599cb004":"# Installing the latest environment","534c9439":"# Configuring ConnectX Board for Custom Dimensions","f8185786":"```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"connectx\",\n  \"title\": \"ConnectX\",\n  \"description\": \"Classic Connect in a row but configurable.\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"agents\": [2],\n  \"configuration\": {\n    \"timeout\": {\n      \"description\": \"Seconds an agent can run before timing out.\",\n      \"type\": \"integer\",\n      \"minimum\": 1,\n      \"default\": 5\n    },\n    \"columns\": {\n      \"description\": \"The number of columns on the board\",\n      \"type\": \"integer\",\n      \"default\": 7,\n      \"minimum\": 1\n    },\n    \"rows\": {\n      \"description\": \"The number of rows on the board\",\n      \"type\": \"integer\",\n      \"default\": 6,\n      \"minimum\": 1\n    },\n    \"inarow\": {\n      \"description\": \"The number of checkers in a row required to win.\",\n      \"type\": \"integer\",\n      \"default\": 4,\n      \"minimum\": 1\n    }\n  },\n  \"reward\": {\n    \"description\": \"0 = Lost, 0.5 = Draw, 1 = Won\",\n    \"enum\": [0, 0.5, 1],\n    \"default\": 0.5\n  },\n  \"observation\": {\n    \"board\": {\n      \"description\": \"Serialized grid (rows x columns). 0 = Empty, 1 = P1, 2 = P2\",\n      \"type\": \"array\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"enum\": [0, 1, 2]\n      },\n      \"default\": []\n    },\n    \"mark\": {\n      \"default\": 0,\n      \"description\": \"Which checkers are the agents.\",\n      \"enum\": [1, 2]\n    }\n  },\n  \"action\": {\n    \"description\": \"Column to drop a checker onto the board.\",\n    \"type\": \"integer\",\n    \"minimum\": 0,\n    \"default\": 0\n  },\n  \"reset\": {\n    \"status\": [\"ACTIVE\", \"INACTIVE\"],\n    \"observation\": [{ \"mark\": 1 }, { \"mark\": 2 }]\n  }\n}\n```","84872c7d":"In order to customize our boards, we need to pass a custom configuration dictionary to `make`.
