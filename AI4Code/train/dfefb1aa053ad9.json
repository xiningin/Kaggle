In addition, the pandemic is shaking up traditional workplace structures and causing employers to rethink how essential tasks can be done, which may broaden their views of workplace accommodations. The authors assessed the potential for the pandemic to improve employment opportunities for people with disabilities. Methods This article analyzes pre-COVID data on disability and home-based work from three representative data sources: the American Community Survey, American Time Use Survey, and Current Population Survey.\" \n\n\"The authors employed both cross-tabulations and regressions to predict work at home. Results they find that workers with disabilities are more likely than those without disabilities both to work primarily from home and to do any work at home. This is true for both employees and self-employed workers. Workers with disabilities face similar wage gaps in on-site and home-based work, indicating that while increased availability of home-based work may create more employment opportunities for workers with disabilities, it is unlikely to erase wage disparities.\" \n\n\"While workers with disabilities are currently more likely to be working primarily from home, only 34% are in occupations with high potential for home-based work, compared to 40% of workers without disabilities.\"\n\n\"Conclusions Workers with disabilities are currently more likely to work from home and many may benefit from expanded work-at-home opportunities, but the types of jobs they hold constrain this potential. Research is needed to see how home-based work evolves as the economy recovers from the pandemic over the next several years.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC7645902\/","d11300b5":"![](https:\/\/encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com\/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQ49gl4vQTXRy255Wkd5aNEALqbcny36zGqIR-fuzjAZPLrQzR2VkTW6Ke8k_y2i5_OT2pnYFjmZAXPaA&usqp=CAU)disabilityict4d.wordpress.com","ea2856bc":"#What jobs can potentially be done at home? How much potential is there for workers with disabilities to work primarily at home?\n\n\"While workers with disabilities are more likely to be working from home currently, their current jobs offer less potential for substantially expanding the extent to which they could work primarily at home. This reflects their disproportionately greater likelihood of being in service and blue-collar occupations that are less amenable to home-based work (e.g., buildings and grounds cleaning and maintenance, where workers with disabilities have the greatest representation). It is also possible that the nature and severity of their disabilities are more likely to limit them to those occupations that cannot be done from home.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC7645902\/"}}
