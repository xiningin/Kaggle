It could be caused by many reasons. The customer's new customer promotion might be expired, and the customer may add more services to their account could also cost higher monthly. On conclusion, we can reject the hypothesis that **the longer you stay, the cheaper you pay.**\n\n**The bar charts shows the churn rate in specific services. The red percentage shows the churn rate and the dollar amount is the average monthly charge on average is the customer choose particular service.**\n\nFor example, we can find that fiber optic is expensive and it lead to really high churn rate. Furthermore, we can see that the churn rate is low with tech support but really high without tech support, but the customer pays more monthly charge on average with tech support.","93633666":"I created several calculated field in Tableau to make visualiztion more clear and concise. \nChurn Customer: the number of Churn Customer\nStayed Customer :  the number of Customer where Churn = no","33549453":"On chart 3 , \n**The bar charts shows the churn rate in specific services.

The visualization is done by Tableau.\nThe following visualization have 3 sheets, each sheet contains different information. I just did part of the visualization from the data so not every column is used. **","29279f3d":"It is the first time I created a kernal so please excuse me for any mistakes. Recommendations and suggestions are very welcomed. I just want to share what I did with you guys and hopefully you can find it helpful. I really appreciate your time to look at my kernal and hope you can have a nice day.  Recommendations and suggestions are very welcomed.\nBy the way, please upvote if you liked my work","42a68d23":"From sheet 1, \nfirst, we can see that the overall Churn rate from this data is 26.54%, we can use it as a benchmark in Churn rate comparison for specific services.\n\nSecond, on the right-hand side, we can see that the average monthly charge for churn customer is 74.44,  and for no churn customer is 61.27.  we can find that the customer who left the company \npaid  13.17  more than stayed customer on average. The total charge showed that the customer who stayed are already spent almost  1000  more than churn customer on average.\n\nThe stacked bar chart showed the number of churn customer and stayed customer on the number of tenure month. we can clearly see that there are large number of customers left the business within first few months. we can conclude that the customer has more willingness to stay if they already use the service for long time.  For example, 61.99% of customer left the company after one month, and only 1.66% of customer who already used the service for 72 months left the business last month \nThe line chart shows the relationship between churn rate and tenure month, we can spot a clear downward trend. It proved our point further that the longer tenure month lead to lower churn rate.\n"}}
