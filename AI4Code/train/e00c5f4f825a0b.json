Fortunately, there are many ways to this. One particular method Bettencourt & Ribeiro described in their 2008 paper, \u201cReal Time Bayesian Estimation of the Epidemic Potential of Emerging Infectious Diseases.\u201d This solution caught my attention because it focuses on the same principles from my first post, Predicting Coronavirus Cases. It uses Bayesian statistics to estimate the most likely value of Rt and also return a credible interval for the true value of Rt.*\n\n*Bettencourt & Ribeiro\u2019s original algorithm to estimate Rt is a function of how many new cases appear each day. The relationship between the number of cases yesterday and the number of cases today give us a hint of what Rt might be. However, we can\u2019t rely on any one day too much in trying to guess Rt, as daily case counts are imperfect due to changing testing capacity, lags in data reporting, and random chance. However, using Bayes\u2019 Theorem, we can take the new information we get from each day\u2019s case count to adjust our expectation of what Rt is, getting closer to the true value as more daily data becomes available.*\n\n*I applied this algorithm to the data to produce a model for each state\u2019s Rt, and how it changes over time. But I noticed something strange. Over time, all states trended asymptotically to Rt = 1.0, refusing to descend below that value. Somehow, the algorithm wasn\u2019t reflecting the reality that Rt could be < 1.0 as well.*\n\n*To fix this, I made one significant change to their algorithm that maintains the integrity of Bettencourt & Ribeiro\u2019s original work while allowing us to see the real-time picture clearly. The change was simple. Instead of considering every previous day of data we have to estimate Rt, I only use the last seven days. Doing so is mathematically sound and produces more accurate results when the model is compared to actual data, but I admit is not reviewed by anyone. While I invite feedback, I\u2019m sharing these results with that disclaimer well in advance.*\n\n[Rt: The metric we need to manage COVID-19](http:\/\/systrom.com\/blog\/the-metric-we-need-to-manage-covid-19\/) \n\n[Kevin Systrom's Notebook](https:\/\/github.com\/k-sys\/covid-19\/blob\/master\/Realtime%20R0.ipynb)","3bef03de":"## 13.
