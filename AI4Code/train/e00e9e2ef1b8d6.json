But for **specific skills** like Tools or Machine Learning frameworks we will look at the Survey's data.\n\n### Technical Skills\nAs put by Jake Vanderplas in his book \"Python Data science Handbook - Essential tools for working with data\"\n\n\"I think people mean when they say \u201c**data science**\u201d: it is fundamentally an **interdisciplinary** subject. Data\nscience comprises **three** distinct and overlapping areas: the skills of a **statistician** who knows how to\nmodel and summarize datasets (which are growing ever larger); the skills of a **computer scientist** who\ncan design and use algorithms to efficiently store, process, and visualize this data; and the **domain\nexpertise** \u2014 what we might think of as \u201cclassical\u201d training in a subject \u2014 necessary both to formulate the\nright questions and to put their answers in context.\n\nHe explained it using http:\/\/drewconway.com\/zia\/2013\/3\/26\/the-data-science-venn-diagram\n\n\n\n### Soft Skills\nWhat I find missing above is Soft skills part.\n\n### 10 C's of Data Science Soft Skills\n\nData Science projects require soft skills as well.\n\n#### Curiosity \n\nWe must be like Curious George (children story book ), have to keep on asking question after question to mine deep into the data.\nCurious George is the protagonist of a series of popular children's books of the same name, written by H. A. Rey and Margret Rey with illustrations by Alan J. Shalleck.\n\n#### Commitment\n\nIt takes a lot of  hard work, solving the problem in hand by analyzing data, coding, researching , story writing all going on at the same time and completing the task.\n\n#### Creativity \n\nOne has to be creative fo many things like for Feature engineering or for presenting Story using pictures or drawings.\n\n#### Collaboration\n\nAs one person may not have all the required skills so working in team cohesively is a great attribute for success.\n\n#### Communication\n\nYou have to tell your story to an audience. For this you need English Language skills to communicate it worldwide. After all its play of words so one must have rich vocabulary.In addition one must have empathy to understand cross cultural context while presenting story to global audience.\n\n#### Credibility\n\nCopying without giving credit to original author or not citing original reference is Plagiarism and one should avoid it. It reflects on integrity or ethics of the author.\n\n#### Calmness\n\nSometimes things will not turn out as you want them to be. You have to maintain calm at that point and proceed with cool head. Getting stuck due to errors, or juggling with multiple technical areas of same difficulty level at same time or large amount of work or wanting to experiment with many choices. Project Management, Planning what is feasible in given Time, Patience and Perseverance may be your friends in such situations.\n\n#### Concentration\n\nBeing complex, Data Science projects, demands high concentration and long hours of sitting on computer desk. Meditation may be your number one friend since Concentration is outcome of Meditation.\n\n#### Courage\n\nIt requires courage to publish honest results as reality may be sometimes bitter and not manipulate results to please management. Or if you have become winner and have been asked to give public presentation you have to fight the stage fright. Or sometimes world wide Rank might go down due to missing attendance at Kaggle. \n\n#### Connaissance\n\nOne might be using High level frameworks like Tensorflow or Pytorch, or middle level apis like scikit-learn, but one must have **clear knowledge** and understanding and just intuition about mathematical and statistical concepts of what is going on at the lowest level or behind the scene. One must thoroughly test that whole data pipeline or system is producing correct expected output and doing what it is supposed to be doing.","16f5d850":"Now let us exlpore Kaggle Survey data to find out **specfic skills** or competence to be developed to become a Data Scientist.\n\n**Principle**\n\n> The inherent principle behind this: \"as the more number of participants will respond, the results would regress towards the mean and then that mean will give a clear baseline about the comprehensive view of the state of Data Science and Machine Learning\".","e8148e70":"**5.4 Data Visualization Tools** \n\nFor this we will analyze responses to Q20 - What data visualization libraries or tools do you use on a regular basis? \n","dad9c4b5":"## 2019 Trends of Data Science Education","6d87df18":"**Results**\n\n1.
