Using the actual proportion from the graph, running a 1-sample z-test eventually reveals that the results are indeed statistically significant.

Let's dig into these results more by looking at the venues that actually create the greatest advantage for their teams (for various reasons).\n\n**18) Display the various venues and their associated ratios for regular season games using the .groupby() function. There are also these following additions: a. The venues must have at least been used for two full NHL seasons (41 home games per season) b. The win ratios must be in descending order c.

I created the following notebook to serve as both an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and a Pandas tutorial that covers some important Pandas functions and syntax.\n\nIn the world of sports, it has been a long-standing debate as to whether or not \"homefield advantage\" is real in professional sports. In other words, does your team have an advantage over another team when playing at your home venue as opposed to the opponent's home venue? This question is tough to answer in professional sports because the level of talent and competition is so high.\n\nIn this exercise, you will utilize game data from the National Hockey League (NHL) over the course of the 2010's decade to gain more insight on the homefield advantage question, at least as it relates to hockey. \n\nCoded solutions are posted in the proper order with comments. If you are looking for a challenge, try following the analysis wihtout looking at the solution code. Enjoy!\n\nStart by running the first cell below:","327e14cd":"We can see that the goals scored by home teams is slightly higher on average, but it might not be convincing enough. Let's now move to the actual number of wins for home teams as opposed to away teams in regular season games.\n\n**15) Display the number of games won by home and away teams using the .value_counts() function. The value_counts function displays the frequency of each separate value of a particular column in the data frame.**","d62b1ca1":"The 'games' data frame includes data from both regular season games and playoff games. Playoff games only include a subset of the teams in the league each year. In order to get a more even distribution of the teams for assessing home ice advantage, we will look only at the regular season games in the data set for now (we will revisit the playoff games later.)\n\n**11) Create a new data frame called 'regularGames' that only contains the regular season games from 'games' using conditional selection. The regular season games are marked with an 'R' in the 'type' column of the 'games' data frame.**\n\n**12) Once again, display the first 5 rows of this new data frame.**","927d89e6":"**23) Calculate the average number of goals scored by the away team in playoff games.**","02e5afcd":"**9) Now that the data has been properly set up, let's do some analysis. First, let's find the most impressive victory by a home team. To do this, we must:\n    a. Sort games by the most goals scored by the home team using the .sort_values() function.\n    b. Further sort the games by the least goals scored by the visiting team using the same .sort_values() function.\n    c. Select the first game (row) on the sorted data frame using the .iloc[] function.**","0c5efdd4":"As we can see, the three metrics just calculated are quite similar to those of the regular season, meaning that they can are likely to have similar results. Home ice advantage is likely an advantage for the host team, whether in the regular season or in the playoffs.\n\nFinally, let's examine the impact of home ice advantage over time across all NHL games (regular season and playoffs). To do this, let's look at the original 'games' data frame and create a line chart visualization.\n\n**25) Create a line graph showing the home team win ratio over each season in the 'games' data frame. Use the .groupby() function to aggregate win ratio data over each season.**","9581f9cd":"While this percentage does tell us that the home team has won many more games than the visiting team, let's see what the win ratio of the home team is (wins \/ total games). Because the home_team_win column is either a 1 or a 0, this ratio can be found by simply computing the average of this column.\n\n**16) Compute the win ratio of the home team using the .mean() function on the home_team_win column.**","0a71294c":"**13) Next, let's look at the number of goals scored by each team to get an initial sense of whether home ice advantage is real. Begin by finding the average number of goals scored by the home team in the regularGames data frame using the .mean() function with the 'home_goals' column.**","4120262f":"**4) Create a function that takes in the name of the data frame and checks if the home team won or not. It should return 1 if the home team won and 0 if the home team did not win.**\n\n**5) Create a new column in the data frame called 'home_team_win' that is set to 1 or 0 for each row depending on whether or not the home team won using the previously created function. The column can be created using square brackets[], and the function can be applied using the .apply() function.**\n\n**6) Output the first 5 rows of the updated data frame in the same way as before.**","613a2c68":"Another good way to visualize the findings being presented is through visuals. Let's make one for the wins vs. losses for the home teams in regular season games.\n\n**17) Create a pie chart that shows the relative frequencies of wins and losses for home teams in regular season games. Use the .plot() function to do so on the two outcomes of the 'home_team_win' column.**","9e22697f":"**7) Filter out unneeded columns from the data frame. Select only the 'season', 'type', 'home_goals', 'away_goals', 'venue', and 'home_team_win' columns and store this updated data frame back into 'games'.**\n\n**8) Once again output the first 5 rows in order to confirm that the filtering has worked properly.**","38bfe2a2":"# In Closing\n\nAfter spiking in 2012, the effect of home ice advantage appears to be trending downward. However, the win ratio of home teams has continued to stay consistently over 50%, indicating that it is likely a real phenomenon. It will be interesting to see how this evolves over the next decade and onward. \n\nI hope you enjoyed working with this notebook, and I also hope that you might have learned a thing or two from the exercise!","b8e4dbb1":"We can see that many of the venues on the two lists above are common names. While part of this might be attributed to higher team quality (aka ability of players), the venue can certainly still have an impact on helping the home team win. After all, home ice advantage is highly likely given the previously mentioned z-test on the data.\n\nMoving on, let's look at some of the similar metrics in playoff games. Playoff games are notable for having an increased level of intensity, both from the players as well as from the fans in the venue.\n\n**20) Create a new data frame called 'playoffGames' and assign it to the filtered set of games with type 'P'. This should be done very similarly to how the 'regularGames' data frame was created.**\n\n**21) Display the first 5 rows of the 'playoffGames' data frame.**","71f0ff21":"**14) Let's now do the same thing for the average number of goals scored by the away team in regular season games.**","a2e41e8e":"We can now see some of the top venues in terms of home team win ratios. Let's now see if some of these top venues are also leaders in the average number of goals scored by the home team. Let's use a visual to see some of these top venues.\n\n**19) Create a horizontal bar plot of the top 10 venues in most goals scored by the home team on average. Once again, let's only include venues that have been used for at least 82 games. Furthermore, let's sort the graph in descending order so that the top value in the graph is the highest value.**"}}
