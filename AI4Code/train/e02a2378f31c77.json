This begs the question: What if there was a different way to calculate or measure emissions factors? We\u2019re challenging the Kaggle community to see if it\u2019s possible to use remote sensing techniques to better model emissions factors. You will develop a methodology to calculate an [average historical emissions factor](https:\/\/www.eia.gov\/tools\/faqs\/faq.php?id=74&t=11) for electricity generation in a sub-national region.\n\nParticipants will be tasked with developing a methodology to calculate an average annual historical emissions factor for the sub-national region. Participants will also be asked to provide an explanation of the conditions that would result in a higher\/lower emissions factor, as well as a recommendation for how the methodology could be applied to calculate the emissions factor of electricity for another geospatial area using similar techniques. Bonus points will be awarded for smaller time slices of the average historical emissions factors, such as one per month for the 12-month period, and additional bonus points will be awarded for participants that develop methodologies for calculating [marginal emissions factors](https:\/\/www.bloomenergy.com\/sites\/default\/files\/watttime_the_rocky_mountain_institute.pdf) for the sub-national region.","83ecaafc":"To win the Kaggle competition you should do this with more rigor and with less simplifications and you should also explain why you think that your methodology is accurate.","f49aa614":"# HOW TO PARTICIPATE\n\nTo make a submission, complete the [submission form](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/page\/environmental-insights-explorer-submission-form).
