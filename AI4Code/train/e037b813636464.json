e.g. per-class recall scores in order to adjust undersampling rate of my training data\n\nFor fine-tuning itself I use Googe Colab, whith the GPU option enabled. When doing this, one simply needs to upload their training and evaluation files (created in the previous step), save them in a google drive and point the script to the right folder. After fine-tuning all tuned weights will be saved in the outputs folder. \n\nThe Colab script can be found here: https:\/\/github.com\/L-ENA\/CORD19scripts\/blob\/master\/CORD_mining.ipynb\n\nAs this is a bit resource intensive, all fine-tuned weights are aviailable here: TODO upload to kaggle\n","dbde8598":"# Aim:\nWe will harness BERTs (or XL-Net or ANY transformers) power of **domain adaptation and transfer learning** to extract entities from any epidemiological study on COVID. \n\n\nFollowing is a short overview and some code on how to merge the datasets and what the final architecture looks like on a super-high level.\n\n# Creating the training, testing, and prediction data\n\n### Step 1: Familiarise myself with the SQuAD data format (json file), and adapt the corpus\n\n* SQuAD consists of domains - namely a whole Wikipedia article as one domain - PURPLE in the picture below\n* Each domain has some question contexts (something like a paragraph of text) - YELLOW \n* Questions about the text, potentially multiple questions about the same paragraph - BLUE\n* Span-annotations of where the labelled answer is OR if there is no answer, a boolean to indicate that - GREEN\n\nWhen I adapt the ebm-nlp corpus: \n* abstracts become domains (purple) \n* sentences become question contexts (yellow)\n* entity types become questions (I created a list of questions that aim to comprehensively ask for entity types, examples below*)\n* sentences with labelled entities become proper span-answers, and sentences without entity become \"impossible answers\" - NB depending on entity type it is worth considering under-sampling some of the impossible answers in order to boost recall (I am a systematic reviewer-turned data scientist so I really care about recall most (ie retrieving ALL entities), and F1 second. This is how systematic reviewing works, and what medical researchers are going to expect if they ever use a tool like this one...)\n* N amount of Original SQuAD domains (eg 200) are randomly selected, and shuffeled in between my adapted ebm-nlp training data. NB of course I don't use any additional SQuAD domains in the evaluation data, because I want my results to be comparable with other architectures trained on the basis of the same data. And even more obvious: I use the ebm-nlp expert-annotated held-out abstracts for evaluation.\n\n\n![SquadArchi.PNG](attachment:SquadArchi.PNG)\n\n\n*, eg asking for study population, I compiled these options: \n\nquests = ['Who was treated?', 'What were the criteria for enrollment?', 'What were the inclusion criteria?',\n                      'Who was enrolled in the study?', 'What were participants diagnosed with?',\n                      'Which participants took part in the study?']","3bef039a":"# Convert the CORD-19 data into a format that we can feed to the network\n","0c85e553":"# Predict on CORD data\n\nThis is essentially a repetition ofthe fine-tuning step, just that one now removes the do train parameter in the colab file and selects a previous trained model as input to compute the predictions!\n\nThere are cells in the COLAB file that do and explain this, and I hope to acutally include the colab script in this Kaggle notebook once I figure out how to do this!\n\nEach CORD task will have its own notebook, where I will go more into detail, and show more data and more visualisations!","e3fe545f":"Above we can see that the raw results from the data mining are not a bad starting point. When sorted by frequency count pneumonia comes up as the top health condition, which is sadly also true in the real world. But there are a lot of duplicates here.....\n\nBelow I am doing some post-processing and clustering on the data. This will be explained in more detail in my task-specific submissions. The resulting top 5 health conditions show for example that cancer and lung cancer have been grouped! \n\nAll in all, this step reduces 566 unique descriptions of health conditions to 291 clusters, and in the resulting data frame we see that for example \"pneumonia (ncp)\" and \"severe covid-19 pneumonia\" get grouped, and that \"type 2 diabetes\" is now part of the \"diabetes\" cluster.","6b66f7c3":"![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n# **Intro:** \n\nPopulation, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcomes (PICO) are key parts of medical systematic or rapid reviews of literature. Since 2005, a significant amount of research already focused on mining this type of information. Using some pre-Covid-19 training data and fine-tuned neural networks, I will show how my system can be used now in order to support evidence synthesis. \n\n## **My previous work as basis for this notebook:** \n\n1. Integrated existing corpora of annotated biomedical entities (5000 abstracts annotated with data of interest to many CORD-19 challenges*)\n\n2. Transformed the baseline task of extracting entities into a Question-Answering task in order to utilise further general reading comprehension data from the SQuAD corpus (I did\/evaluated\/published these models early February).\n\n3. Described a process of enriching NER data through the Squad corpus, and to describe how this boosts the results\n\n\n## **Contribution to CORD-19:**\n\n1. Applying the aforementioned models to abstracts in the CORD dataset\n2. Processing the results, deriving interactive plots, trends between different versions of the dataset, word clouds...\n3. Trying to provide a framework that allows to integrate all available training data over time!\n\n\n### TL;DR :  Merge existing NER (biomedical) and reading comprehension (general topic) data. Get a high-performing specialised population, health condition, and outcome classifier with general reading-comprehension ability. Also, aim is to present data interactively and in a meaningful way.\n\n\n\n*I did not even train models on most tasks! But it is possible with the code in this notebook\/my GIT! The corpus has age-group, samle size, pharma vs non-pharma, and outcome types such as mortality or different adverse events annotated https:\/\/ebm-nlp.herokuapp.com\/annotations \n\nAbout merging it with SquAD: I  did not even use the whole SQuAD data because its just **too much training data ** and my GPU access is limited\n","59c516c3":"# The training data:\n\n1) 5000 entity-annotated abstracts of medical clinical trials [1].* \n\n2) The SQuAD v.2 data for general reading comprehension in question answering, we will use random parts of the corpus, at most 200 domains [2].\n\n3) Jumping on the Transformer train; we can use basically any pre-trained architecture capable of performing the SQuAD task implemented by Huggingface's Transformers [3].
