Most of the customer population is comprised by middle aged people, and the older the population gets, the less they tend to go to the mall.\n2. There is a considerable difference to the men\/women rate. Women comprises the largest part of the population of customers.\n3. By considering the Spending Score set by the mall, we can see that younger and middle aged people tend to buy more, while older people does so less frequently. \n4. It is possible to note that there is a cluter of occurrences, in both genders, when it comes to Annual Income and Spending Score, which means that the average Spending Score is related to the income of 40k to 70k. \n\n\n\nThis was my first Kernel ever. The objective here was to exercise the content learned recently regarding data science and the libraries within Python.
