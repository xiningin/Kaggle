With bar charts, each column represents a group defined by a categorical variable; and with histograms, each column represents a group defined by a continuous, quantitative variable.\n\nOne implication of this distinction: It can be appropriate to talk about the skewness of a histogram; that is, the tendency of the observations to fall more on the low end or the high end of the X axis.\n\nWith bar charts, however, the X axis does not have a low end or a high end; because the labels on the X axis are categorical - not quantitative. As a result, it is not appropriate to comment on the skewness of a bar chart.\n\nHistogram :\n    1 - The histogram is a term that refers to a graphical representation that shows data by way of bars to display the         frequency of numerical data. \n    2 - Distribution of non-discrete variables. \n    3 - Bars touch each other, so there are no spaces between bars. \n    4 - In this type of graph, elements are grouped so that they are considered as ranges. \n    5 - Histogram width may vary. \n    6 - To display the frequency of occurrences.\n    7 - In Histogram, the data points are grouped and rendered based on its bin value. \n    8 - The items of the Histogram are numbers, which should be categorized to represent data range.\n    9 - In Histogram, we cannot rearrange the blocks.\n\nBar Graph :\n    1 - The bar graph is a graphical representation of data that uses bars to compare different categories of data. \n    2 - Comparison of discrete variables. \n    3 - Bars never touch each other, so there are spaces between bars. \n    4 - In this type of graph, elements are taken as individual entities. \n    5 - The bar chart is mostly of equal width. \n    6 - To compare different categories of data.\n    7 - In the Bar graph, each data point is rendered as a separate bar. \n    8 - As opposed to the bar graph, items should be considered as individual entities. \n    9 - Bar graph, it is common to rearrange the blocks, from highest to lowest .","5feec2e5":"**Notebook information : **\nWork with matplotlib library\n\nMatplotlib is a cross-platform, data visualization and graphical plotting library for Python and its numerical extension NumPy. As such, it offers a viable open source alternative to MATLAB. Developers can also use matplotlib's APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to embed plots in GUI applications."}}
