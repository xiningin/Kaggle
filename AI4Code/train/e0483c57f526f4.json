Soon after we observe that the number of fires keeps increasing and decreasing. With that, we conclude that it is difficult to observe an increase in the number of fires, the numbers are still very high.

Such impacts are increasingly intensified by the destruction caused by forest fires (DENNISON et al., 2014). These events cause several problems, not only environmental, but also cause economic damage and represent a great danger to life. Understanding the frequency of forest fires over a period of time can help you take steps to avoid them.\n\n### Data\n\nThis dataset reports the number of forest fires in Brazil divided by states. The series covers the period of approximately 10 years (1998 to 2017). Data can be found below:\n\n- [dados.gov](http:\/\/dados.gov.br\/dataset\/sistema-nacional-de-informacoes-florestais-snif)\n\nWith these data, it is possible to assess the evolution of fires over the years, as well as the regions where they were concentrated.\nLegal Amazon comprises the states of Acre, Amap\u00e1, Par\u00e1, Amazonas, Rond\u00f4nia, Roraima and part of Mato Grosso, Tocantins and Maranh\u00e3o."}}
