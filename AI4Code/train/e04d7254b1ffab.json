Yet, the trend remains pretty stable for the recent years and so we have decided to only focus on the 2016 data. (2016 is used instead 2017 because 2017 has more missing values.)","a29346b1":"To answer this question, we look at the relationship between a country's happiness and the percentage of her people having religion. We get the religion percentage from another dataset and we did the merge earlier.","1ab40629":"Seems like happiness is positively correlated with freedom.

Therefore, it is possible that part of the reasons why Latin Americans are happier is a born gift.","db167ccf":"Looks like countries that top the happiness list tend to be wealthy countries. Next, we are interested to find out if there is really a relationship between a country's happiness and its GDP per capita.","9c582872":"## 3.

When examining the positive relationship between happiness level and gdp per capita, we found that Latin Americans are an exception - they are happy despite their low GDP. Then, we try to look for the reason behind that and our visualizations suggest Latin Americans' happiness is probably the product of their great social support from families and friends, together with their genetic structure, high freedom level and long life expectancy.","691a218c":"Freedom (ranges from 0 to 1) measures how much freedom people in a country can enjoy, the higher the value the more freedom.

People in Africa have the lowest happiness score in general.\n\nNoteworthy is that the low happiness scores for Venezuela and Haiti stand out among Latin American countries. Yet, this is not surprising because Venezuela has been suffering from hyperinflation (inflation rate >4000%) for years and Haiti is very vulnerable to natural disasters (Ref: 2,3).","0e15602e":"To examine whether this is the reason why Latin Americans are happier, we refer to the social_support column in our data. Social_support (ranges from 0 to 1) measures how much social support people in a country can get, the higher the value the more support one can get. The definition of social_support is as follows:\n\nSocial support (or having someone to count on in times of trouble) is the national average of the binary responses (either 0 or 1) to the question \u201cIf you were in trouble, do you have relatives or friends you can count on to help you\nwhenever you need them, or not?\u201d","86392a9e":"We also explore other possible reasons why Latin Americans are happier by looking at the relationship between happiness and freedom\/ life expectancy.","65cbeba9":"<a id='introduction'><\/a>","59d44bf7":"## Happiness Trend Over Time","c8009fed":"We have 164 countries, and it's a lot if we are to look at their trend one by one.

For example, from the scatter plot of happiness vs GDP, we see that Latin Americans are happier than people in other countries with similar GDP, but we cannot be sure if Latin America is really comparable to these other countries in all other aspects such as social support, life expectancy, etc. Thus, if we want an apple to apple comparison, we should compare Latin America with other places that have similar ratings in all other aspects or even run a regression model to control for other variables.\n\n\n- When we look at relationship between happiness and gene, it would be helpful if we can have the actual data regarding how much \"happy allele\" different groups of people get so that we can have a better understanding of how this \"happy allele\" affects happiness.","77ddc617":"<a id='happiness_religion'><\/a>","043c7080":"- [Introduction](#introduction)\n\n- [Happiness Trend Over Time](#happiness_trend)\n\n- [Happiness by Country (2016)](#happiness_2016)\n\n- [Happiness vs GDP per capita](#happiness_gdp)\n\n- [Why are Latin Americans Happier?](#happiness_latin)\n   - [Happiness vs Social Support](#happiness_social)\n   - [Happiness vs Religion](#happiness_religion)\n   - [Happiness vs Gene](#happiness_gene)\n- [Other Data Exploration](#happiness_other)\n- [Conclusion](#happiness_conclusion)\n- [Limitation & Future Research Direction](#happiness_limitation)\n- [Reference](#happiness_reference)","f265926f":"Our data is a panel data that measures happiness by country over time.
