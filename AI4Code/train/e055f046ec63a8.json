The time step is different according to days : it is 1h from 0h to 12h and rises to 3h after 12h (from 12h to 24h of range forecasts).\n\nFinally, the 3D data are stored in 2 different netcdf files, according to the vertical levels:\n* height levels (height in the file name) : 20, 100, 500, 875, 1375, 2000 and 3000 m\n* isobar levels (isobar in the file name) : 1000, 950, 925, 850, 700, 600 and 500 hPa\n\nThe parameters are as follows:\n* height levels (height in the file name) : pressure (in Pa)\n* isobar levels (isobar in the file name) : temperature (in K), *pseudo-adiabatic potential temperature of the wet bulb* (in K), relative humidity (in %), wind speed (in m.s-1), wind direction (in \u00b0), *U and V wind components* (in m.s-1), *vertical velocity* (in Pa.s-1), *geopotential* (in m2.s-2)\n\nFor more information, cf [documentation](https:\/\/meteofrance.github.io\/meteonet\/english\/data\/weather-models\/).\n\n*Physical sense of variables*\n* *pseudo-adiabatic potential temperature of the wet bulb* : temperature affected to an air particle brought back to its condensation level. It is about a near-conversative parameter. It allows to follow the state of an air particle in a satured atmosphere and then allows to follow the evolution of a perturbation, depression (or a satured air mass). For example, this parameter at 850hPa is very useful to know the depression structure and to follow its evolution.\n* *horizontal wind speed components:*, U : from west to east and V : from south to north.\n* *vertical velocity*: vertical speed; the displacement is expressed in Pa (in meteorology, the vertical levels are often expressed in isobar levels, cf weather_models_explanations.md for more details); The higher the height is, the lower the pressure is. If the vertical velocity is positive, there is an upward current (ex : the earth surface is warmed by the sun). The opposite corresponds to a downdraft (ex : an cold air mass passes above a warmer ground).\n* *geopotential*: it is used to compute the pressure and takes account the local gravity variations of the Earth. The height of the geopotential is interesting in meteorology : it allows to get the constant pressure heights. A high geopotential (pressure levels have high heights) is often associated to an anticyclone and a low geopotential (pressure levels have low heights) corresponds to a depression.\n"}}
