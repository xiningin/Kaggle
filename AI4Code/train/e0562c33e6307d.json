In the same month, the National Environment Agency (NEA) published an article with the headline \u2018Number Of Weekly Dengue Cases Expected To Exceed The Historical High Of 891 Unless Urgent Collective Community Action Is Taken\u2019. \n\nBoth articles surprised me and made me wonder if it was a coincidence. I casted my instincts aside and decided to perform a data analysis. For this project, I intend to find the relationship between the amount of rainfall and the number of dengue cases in Singapore. It is known that Aedes mosquitoes breed at a faster rate when there is an abundance of stagnant water. Since we live in a country that experiences a tropical wet and dry climate, there are periods of high and low rainfall. Likewise, dengue cases vary across the months. Hence, I conducted an analysis to determine if rainfall is a factor for the surge of dengue cases in Singapore.","38db070a":"**Plotting of Graph: Analysis on Dengue Cases and Rainfall in 2020**","f291f092":"Previews","f04e06b0":"# Number of Dengue Cases (2019 to 2020 Week 36)\n\nFor my first graph, I wanted to show the trend from 2019 to 2020. To plot the graph, I created a table and used a function to store all dengue cases per week.","f94174eb":"**Reading CSV Files (Rainfall Dataset)**\n\nFor the next part of this project, I introduced the rainfall dataset which is obtained from Data.gov.sg as well. This dataset has a wide range of values as it shows data from 1982 till July 2020. ","fb6819e1":"Previews","4fe07a7a":"**Understanding the Graph**\n\nThis graph tells us 2020's dengue cases are increasing at a faster rate when compared to 2019. In addition, weekly cases in 2020 have all exceeded 2019 so far which spells great concern and severity.","a580698b":"**Converting Weeks to Months for Dengue Dataset**","fb429fe1":"**Understanding and Cleaning our Dataset**\n\nAs seen above, there are various diseases included such as 'Mumps' and 'Encephalitis'. These diseases are not relevant to my project as I would only like to know the number of dengue cases. Hence, I selected rows that are relevant to my analysis. In addition, I decided to use data from 2019 and 2020 because they are more recent. Separate copies of the dataset are created to use for plotting for other graphs as well.","da427199":"**Understanding the Graph**\n\nAs shown above, the number of dengue cases is increasing in an alarming rate.

This dataset provides the number of cases for a specific disease recorded from 2012 to week 36 of 2020 which is at the time of this writing. ","e4fce4da":"**Understanding and Cleaning our Dataset**\n\nI decided to use data from 2020 only, to remain consistent with the dengue dataset. First, I dropped all null values, and created a function to convert weeks to months. I researched on the number of weeks in each month so that the rainfall values are accurate. Afterwards, I prepared two lists which are for the plotting of graphs later.","b79f12d8":"**Understanding the Graph**\n\nLooking at the above graph, it tells us that there is no direct relationship between rainfall and dengue. For instance, in May 2020, rainfall was at its peak but the number of dengue cases recorded was about the same as the months before (even though the rainfall data varied). Similarly, in July 2002, rainfall has dipped but the number of cases remained high. Based on these observations, I believe rainfall is not the only factor for the rise in dengue cases.  ","a827773e":"Preview","7e872d42":"As the dengue cases recorded have one additional month, I removed it so that the rainfall and dengue cases are equal in lengths when plotting the graph.","b2fc67fe":"**Plotting of Graph: Dengue Cases Comparison (2019 and 2020)**","68ee9c8c":"Preview","09e05d14":"# **Correlation Between Dengue Cases and Rainfall**","18f4be31":"**Importing of Modules and Packages**","046a369f":"Note: I showed the first ten elements only as the full list contains a length of 88 values.","202936e6":"# Plotting of Graph: Comparison of Dengue Cases in 2019 and 2020\n\nI took a step further to see exactly which months started to show a spike in dengue cases, and compared it with the previous year. First, I made use of the copied datasets and created two tables to store data for 2019 and 2020 separately. As 2020 has only data up to week 36, I had to fill the remaining weeks with 0 for the number of cases so that their lengths are the same when plotting the graph. In addition, I shortened the 'year\/week' to the week number for declutter.","788f4ea1":"**Determining the Difference in Lengths and Appending the Value '0'**","74d0f7fe":"# Conclusion\n\nYes, rainfall is not the sole factor, as I believe there are other factors affecting the surge in dengue cases. For example, weather conditions like humidity and amount of sunlight can also influence the data. In addition, human behaviours like not adhering to dengue initiatives or overcomplacency can increase the spread of dengue. If more research and data can determine the causes of the surge of dengue, the Government can take a more clear and direct action to stop the spread of dengue. "}}
