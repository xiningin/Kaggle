One of the features I took on was including salary information for data scientists, based on data available via Glassdoor.  As can be seen in the dataset, there were several cities where salaries were missing (and others were Glassdoor rates the information as low confidence).  \n\nI wanted to see if I could use the cost of living information, along with the salaries already included to develop a linear regressor for predicting data scientist salaries to \"fill in the gaps\" and for other cities not included in the data set.\n\nTo start, I imported the data and set the index to the cities, to make eliminate the numerical index and replace with categorical indices.","48d253a1":"Next, for ease of building the model, let's print the column titles.","974133e8":"Now, the dataset is column oriented by city, which is the field we are trying to backfill.
