The line at the 45\u00ba angle shows perfectly equal income distribution, while the other line shows the actual distribution of income. The further away from the diagonal, the more unequal the size of the distribution of income.\n\n![Lorenz-curves-for-different-types-of-distribution.png](attachment:Lorenz-curves-for-different-types-of-distribution.png)","a5041f91":"# <h1 align='left'> $\\color{green}{\\text{Comments}}$ <\/h1>\nBelow are Gini Values of 10 tiff images.","9b6ac5a0":"# <h1 align='left'> $\\color{Blue}{\\text{Gini coeffcient}}$ <\/h1>\n*  The Gini coeffcient is widely used to measure the dispersion of a variable across a population, region, or nation. The most common use of the Gini coeffecient is to measure the degree of inequality in the distribution of annual income across a population. \n* The index is calculated from the Lorenz curve (Lorenz, 1905), in which cumulative income is plotted against cumulative population arranged from the poorest to the richest. \n* It is aspatial because it aggregates income categories regardless of where they are located. \n* The diagonal line at 45 degrees represents perfect equality of incomes.\n* The Gini coefficient may vary from 0(Perfect equality) to 1(Perfect inequality).\n* Simply Gini Coefficient used to measure the degree of income equality in population.\n\n\n![gini_formula.png](attachment:gini_formula.png)\n","d2129493":"# **Reference:**\nhttps:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/266224607_The_Night_Light_Development_Index_NLDI_A_spatially_explicit_measure_of_human_development_from_satellite_data\nhttps:\/\/www.drishtiias.com\/daily-updates\/daily-news-analysis\/lorenz-curve-and-gini-coefficient#:~:text=The%20Gini%20Coefficient%2C%20which%20is,to%201%20(perfect%20inequality).","24669135":"# <h1 align='center'> $\\color{green}{\\text{Nightlight Satellite Image analsyis}}$ <\/h1>\n<B>Nightlight data<B> - apart from decoration they are now become socioeconomic indicators with other reliable information to predict the wealth and inequality of country.
