Broader than the narrow metric of the infant and child mortality, which focus solely at mortality at a young age, life expectancy captures the mortality along the entire life course. It tells us the average age of death in a population.**\n\n**Estimates suggest that in a pre-modern, poor world, life expectancy was around 30 years in all regions of the world.**\n\n\n**Life expectancy has increased rapidly since the Age of Enlightenment. In the early 19th century, life expectancy started to increase in the early industrialized countries while it stayed low in the rest of the world. This led to a very high inequality in how health was distributed across the world. Good health in the rich countries and persistently bad health in those countries that remained poor. Over the last decades this global inequality decreased. No country in the world has a lower life expectancy than the countries with the highest life expectancy in 1800. Many countries that not long ago were suffering from bad health are catching up rapidly.**","47f3feb3":"For the year 2007, gdppercapita and life expectancy rate highs,\nWhich tells as gdppercapita increases life expectancy rate also increases,","fd9abe2a":"**What is GDP?**\n\n*** Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the monetary value of all finished goods and services made within a country during a specific period.**\n\n*** GDP provides an economic snapshot of a country, used to estimate the size of an economy and growth rate.**\n\n*** GDP can be calculated in three ways, using expenditures, production, or incomes. It can be adjusted for inflation and population to provide deeper insights.**\n\n*** Though it has limitations, GDP is a key tool to guide policymakers, investors, and businesses in strategic decision-making.**","d42564ae":"![image.png](attachment:cacae582-c88a-4f6a-b8cd-f6b0fa26ba4c.png)\n","a2158913":"This is for the country Canada."}}
