to the table above, 53% of all International Movies (2437) are dramas. 30% are comedies and 15% in the action & adventure genre. \n\nYou are probably questioned why the sum of the percent doesn't give a 100%. It is because that it might be a combination of genres, for example, drama and comedy. Apriori algorithms calculate any mentioned combination in all records and return its frequency.\n\nFor instance, suppose we have two international movies with genres \"dramas, crime, documentaries\" and \"dramas, comedies\". In this case, 100% of international movies are drama and 50% are crime. \n\nLet's look at the International TV Shows genres:","f3ff9f14":"# Summary\nIn this work we cleaned, reshaped, and visualize the __actors, directors, countries, and genres__ columns of the Netflix dataset. It is not easy to analyze these columns because each contains several values. Thus, each variable has its own encoded dataset with the \"show_id\" primary key. So you can merge them with source data to answer to interested you questions about  actors, directors, countries, or genres. I performed basic visualization just to show how we can operate and use these tables. Feel free to use these tables and function to perform more complicated exploratory data analysis. I hope I accomplished all task's  requirements and my code would serve to the further sophisticated analysis work.","ecdd7556":"# **Netflix: Movies and TV Shows (preprocessing and cleaning)**\n \nThe purpose of this notebook is to cleanse the comma-separated values into tables for __unique actors, directors, countries, and genres__. Then we'll analyze the reshaped dataset in case to find any interesting patterns and try to satisfy the task's expectations. \n\n**Task Details:**\nAs mentioned above,  columns in this dataset have comma-separated values, which makes it difficult to find how many titles an actor or actress appeared in or how many titles a director has filmed.\n\n**Expected Submission:**\nCleanse the comma-separated values into tables for unique actors, directors, countries, and genres that can be linked back to the original dataset via the **\"show_id\"** field.","be2fa555":"The most popular genre of International TV Shows is also drama (40%). Nevertheless, romantic and crime are in the 2nd and 3rd places respectively, which is make sense for the TV Shows segment - people tend to watch detective and love dramas on TV).\n\nNow, again, reset indexes of the one-hot genre dataset in case if we want to merge it with initial dataset.","8cd24c84":"To interpret this table is not too hard. For example, a movie\/TV Show with __show_id__ _\"s1\"_ was made in Brazil. Thus Brazil column is _True_ for this row. The rest columns are _False_.

","8d72ace4":"# Country Analysis\n---\nRather than show production countries with the highest value count and build a bar plot of that (if be honest, you can find this kind of information in other notebooks), I would like to analyze country interaction in the production process (such as with which country the US produce more movies\/TV shows) and to create a new dataframe to satisfy task demand. \n\nOne-hot encoding can help to perform it. Basically, this approach is using for market basket analysis to create association rules, but I think it is suitable in our case.
