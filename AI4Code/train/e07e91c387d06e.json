Whether is it exoplanet or not? Now Can We somehow plot this in high dimention and we can get a result. \n\n> The closer star will have higher flux and the star which is far will have lower flux. Then We can easily do this. \n> \nWait I know one algorithm Which works in same way. **The SVM.**\n\nYes in such scenario this is the best algorithm. \n\nLets apply it and check with accuracy.

Which is pretty good.","25b4958b":"Lets check with data.","5ab602f2":"Here all the data obtained from scientific instrument. Besides some instrumental error we hardly expect any other error. Woww then We dont have to do data cleaning.\n\nThats cool. We can do EDA but we had 3197 features and finding the right one is really gonna tough task.\n\n> But as far as flux is considered, Every flux should have equal correlation with prediction. So one thing is clear that We gonna have all flux as features and we gonna train the model.\n \n But Wait which model we going to use to train?\n \n Now We got problem having binary distribution so We can use naive bayes algorithm with is good at that. \n \n Then Lets do it check with accuaracy."}}
