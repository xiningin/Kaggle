In this notebook, we will discover the support vector machine algorithm as well as it implementation in scikit-learn. We will also discover the Principal Component Analysis and its implementation with scikit-learn.\n\n# 1. Support Vector Machine \u2014 (SVM)\n\nSupport vector machine is another simple algorithm that every machine learning expert should have in his\/her arsenal. Support vector machine is highly preferred by many as it produces significant accuracy with less computation power. Support Vector Machine, abbreviated as SVM can be used for both regression and classification tasks. But, it is widely used in classification objectives.\n\n## 1. 1. What is Support Vector Machine?\nThe objective of the support vector machine algorithm is to find a hyperplane in an N-dimensional space(N \u2014 the number of features) that distinctly classifies the data points.\n\n![svm.png](attachment:svm.png)![svm_2.png](attachment:svm_2.png)\n\nTo separate the two classes of data points, there are many possible hyperplanes that could be chosen. Our objective is to find a plane that has the maximum margin, i.e the maximum distance between data points of both classes. Maximizing the margin distance provides some reinforcement so that future data points can be classified with more confidence.\n\n## 1. 2. Hyperplanes and Support Vectors\n\n![support_vector.png](attachment:support_vector.png)\nHyperplanes are decision boundaries that help classify the data points. Data points falling on either side of the hyperplane can be attributed to different classes. Also, the dimension of the hyperplane depends upon the number of features. If the number of input features is 2, then the hyperplane is just a line. If the number of input features is 3, then the hyperplane becomes a two-dimensional plane. It becomes difficult to imagine when the number of features exceeds 3.\n\n![support_vector_2.jpg](attachment:support_vector_2.jpg)\n\nSupport vectors are data points that are closer to the hyperplane and influence the position and orientation of the hyperplane. Using these support vectors, we maximize the margin of the classifier. Deleting the support vectors will change the position of the hyperplane. These are the points that help us build our SVM.\n\n## 1. 3. Large Margin Intuition\nIn logistic regression, we take the output of the linear function and squash the value within the range of [0,1] using the sigmoid function. If the squashed value is greater than a threshold value(0.5) we assign it a label 1, else we assign it a label 0. In SVM, we take the output of the linear function and if that output is greater than 1, we identify it with one class and if the output is -1, we identify is with another class. Since the threshold values are changed to 1 and -1 in SVM, we obtain this reinforcement range of values([-1,1]) which acts as margin.","48feaae3":"# 4. Principal Component Analysis\n\nPCA is:\n* Linear dimensionality reduction using Singular Value Decomposition of the data to project it to a lower dimensional space.\n* Unsupervised Machine Learning\n* A transformation of your data and attempts to find out what features explain the most variance in your data. For example:\n\n![PCA.png](attachment:PCA.png)","8d23e792":"## 4. 1. PCA Visualization\n\nAs we've noticed before it is difficult to visualize high dimensional data, we can use PCA to find the first two principal components, and visualize the data in this new, two-dimensional space, with a single scatter-plot. Before we do this though, we'll need to scale our data so that each feature has a single unit variance.","92f736a8":"### 2. 3. 3.

For example, some kernels are specialized for specific data structures. string kernels are sometimes used when classifying text document on DNA sequences.\n\nWith so many kernels to choose from, how can you decide which one to use? As a rule of thumb, you should always try the linear kernel first, especially if the training set is very large or if it has plenty of features. If the training se is not too large, you should try the Gaussian RBF kernel as well. "}}
