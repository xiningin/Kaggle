It was also my first time trying to plot anything on a map. \n\n## Known issues\n\nIt appears that the 2020 file county names do not all align with the names in the 2016 file.  Since this was just an exercise, I'm not planning to add another mapping file (cross-walk) to fill in the remainder of the map.\n\nThe code would be cleaner if some things could be moved into functions and re-used.\n\nA 2020 elections file which included `fips` would also simplify things since the entire chunk of state-county-fips code to map the 2020 results could be removed completely.  \n\n## Findings\n\nI did not attempt to make any conclusions based on the outcome.","82cad4da":"### Plot raw 2016 dem percent","5cda2985":"## Load in the 2016 data\n"}}
