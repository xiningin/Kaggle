For example, the distribution of sum of heights of all men in a region tends towards a Gaussian probability distribution.\n\n- 68% of the data falls within the first standard deviation from the mean.\n- 95% fall within two standard deviations.\n- 99.7% fall within three standard deviations.","d46d2e53":"<a id=\"P-value\"><\/a>\n# <u> P-value <\/u>\n\n<a id=\"Hypothesis testing\"><\/a>\n## <u> Hypothesis testing <\/u>\nHypothesis testing is a statistical method that is used in making statistical decisions using experimental data. It is an assumption that we make about the population parameter. A hypothesis test evaluates two mutually exclusive statements about a population to determine which statement is best supported by the sample data.\n\n<b>Null hypothesis <\/b>: A null hypothesis is a general statement or default position.\n\nExample : a company production is = 50 unit\/per day.\n\n<b>Alternative hypothesis <\/b>: The alternative hypothesis is the hypothesis that is contrary to the null hypothesis.\n\nExample : a company production is !=50 unit\/per day etc.\n\n<b>Level of significance <\/b>: Refers to the degree of significance in which we accept or reject the null-hypothesis. 100% accuracy is not possible for accepting or rejecting a hypothesis, so we therefore select a level of significance that is usually 5% which means the output should be 95% confident to give similar kind of result in each sample.\n\n\nIn a Probability Distribution graph, we have the range of values on the x-axis and the frequency of occurrences of different values on the y-axis. If we pick any random value from this distribution, the probability that we will pick values close to the mean is highest as it has the highest peak (due to high occurrence values in that region). If we move away from the peak, the occurrence of the values decreases rapidly and so does the corresponding probability, towards a very small value close to zero.","19fb4b9f":"<a id=\"Remarks\"><\/a>\n## <u> Remarks <\/u>\n\n- Although a low p-value promotes the rejection of the null hypothesis, it addresses nothing about the probability of rejecting it.\n- We choose the significance level before we perform the experiment. If the p-value satisfies our level of significance (p < alpha), only then can we make conclusions.\n- To talk about a null hypothesis being true using a p-value is impossible. A high p-value means that our data is highly consistent with our null hypothesis, nothing more.","0d753712":"<a id=\"Binomial Distribution\"><\/a>\n## <u> Binomial Distribution <\/u> \n\nThis type of distribution is used when there are exactly two outcomes of a trial.

With any set of 3 numbers with the same mean, for example: 12,8 and 10 or say 9,10 and 11, there is only one value for any 2 given values in the set.

The magnitude of the covariance is not easily interpreted.\n\n$$Cov(\ud835\udc4b, \ud835\udc4c ) = \\frac{\\sum(x_i - \\bar{x}) (y_i - \\bar{y})}{N-1}$$\n\n$$Cov(\ud835\udc4b, \ud835\udc4b) = Var(\ud835\udc4b)$$\n$$Cov(\ud835\udc4b, \ud835\udc4c ) = Cov(\ud835\udc4c, \ud835\udc4b)$$\n\nThe use of the mean in the calculation suggests the need for each data sample to have a Gaussian or Gaussian-like distribution. Term in numerator is called the sum of cross products. Term in denominator (N-1) indicates the degrees of freedom.\n\nThe value of covariance is affected by the change in scale of the variables. If all the values of the given variable are multiplied by a constant and all the values of another variable are multiplied, by a similar or different constant, then the value of covariance also changes.\nCovariance can take any value between -\u221e and +\u221e.\n\n<a id=\"Correlation \/ Pearson's Correlation\"><\/a>\n## <u> Correlation \/ Pearson's Correlation<\/u>\n\nBoth Covariance and Correlation measures the relationship and the dependency between two variables. \u201cCovariance\u201d indicates the direction of the linear relationship between variables whereas \u201cCorrelation\u201d measures both the magnitude and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. Correlation values are standardized whereas, covariance values are not. When we divide the covariance values by the standard deviation, it scales the value down to a limited range of -1 to +1 that represents the limits of correlation from a full negative correlation to a full positive correlation. A value of 0 means no correlation. The value below -0.5 or above 0.5 indicates a notable correlation, and values below those values suggests a less notable correlation.\n\n$$Corr_{xy} = \\frac{Cov(\ud835\udc4b, \ud835\udc4c )}{\\sigma_x \\sigma_y}$$\n\nTypes of correlations:\n- Positive Correlation: both variables change in the same direction.\n- Neutral Correlation: No relationship in the change of the variables.\n- Negative Correlation: variables change in opposite directions.\n\nThe value of correlation is not influenced by the change in scale of the values. \n\nThe performance of some algorithms can deteriorate if two or more variables are tightly related, called multicollinearity. An example is Logistic Regression or Linear Regression. Decision trees and boosted trees algorithms are immune to multicollinearity by nature.\n\n<b>Quick Tip<\/b> : Multicollinearity can be handled by: 1 -  Delete one of the perfectly correlated features. 2 -  Use a dimension reduction algorithm such as Principle Component Analysis (PCA).\n\n","5fd6205a":"#### <u> PCA with correlation matrix <\/u>","386c2246":"first array represents chi square values and second array represnts p-values.","ed5dd996":"<a id=\"Parametric Statistical Hypothesis Tests\"><\/a>\n## <u> Parametric Statistical Hypothesis Tests <\/u>\n<a id=\"Student\u2019s t-test\"><\/a>\n### <u> Student\u2019s t-test <\/u>\n\nA common question about two or more datasets is whether they are same\/different.

In simpler terms, it means that almost 93% of the variance in the data-set can be explained using the first principal component with measures of \u2018disp\u2019 and \u2018hp\u2019.\n\nAs a conclusion, not a lot of significant insights can be driven from the Principal Component Analysis on the basis of the covariance matrix.","7a568fc2":"Since the probability(0.8) of success is greater than 0.5 the distribution is skewed towards the right side.","d05f0c0f":"* [Statistical Estimators](#Statistical Estimators)\n    - [Central Tendency](#Central Tendency)\n    - [Mean](#Mean)\n    - [Median](#Median)\n    - [Mode](#Mode)\n    - [Variance](#Variance)\n    - [Standard deviation](#Standard deviation)\n    - [Covariance](#Covariance)\n    - [Correlation \/ Pearson's Correlation](#Correlation \/ Pearson's Correlation)\n    - [Standard Error](#Standard Error)     \n* [Probability Distributions](#Probability Distributions)\n    - [Gausian \/ Normal distribution](#Gausian \/ Normal distribution)  \n         - [Standard Normal distribution](#Standard Normal distribution)\n    - [Student\u2019s T-Distribution](#Student\u2019s T-Distribution) \n    - [Binomial Distribution](#Binomial Distribution) \n    - [Bernoulli\u2019s Distribution](#Bernoulli\u2019s Distribution) \n    - [Uniform Distribution](#Uniform Distribution)\n    - [Exponential Distribution](#Exponential Distribution)\n    - [Poisson Distribution](#Poisson Distribution)\n    - [Probability Density Function and Probability Mass Function](#Probability Density Function and Probability Mass Function)\n* [P-value](#P-value)\n* [Degrees of Freedom](#Degrees of Freedom)\n* [Parametric vs. Non-Parametric Data](#Parametric vs. Non-Parametric Data) \n     - [Parametric Data](#Parametric Data)\n     - [Non-Parametric Data](#Non-Parametric Data) \n* [Univariate Statistical Analysis](#Univariate Statistical Analysis)\n     - [Normality Tests](#Normality Tests)\n         - [Shapiro-Wilk Test](#Shapiro-Wilk Test) \n         - [D\u2019Agostino\u2019s K^2 Test](#D\u2019Agostino\u2019s K^2 Test) \n         - [Anderson-Darling Test](#Anderson-Darling Test)\n     - [Correlation Tests](#Correlation Tests)  \n         - [Covariance Analysis](#Covariance Analysis) \n         - [Pearson\u2019s Correlation Coefficient](#Pearson\u2019s Correlation Coefficient) \n         - [Spearman\u2019s Rank Correlation](#Spearman\u2019s Rank Correlation) \n         - [Chi-Squared Test](#Chi-Squared Test)\n     - [Parametric Statistical Hypothesis Tests](#Parametric Statistical Hypothesis Tests)\n          - [Student\u2019s t-test](#Student\u2019s t-test) \n          - [Analysis of Variance Test (ANOVA)](#Analysis of Variance Test)\n     - [Nonparametric Statistical Hypothesis Tests](#Nonparametric Statistical Hypothesis Tests)\n          - [Mann-Whitney U Test](#Mann-Whitney U Test) \n          - [Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test](#Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test) \n          - [Kruskal-Wallis H Test](#Kruskal-Wallis H Test) \n          - [Friedman Test](#Friedman Test)\n* [Multivariate Statistical Analysis](#Multivariate Statistical Analysis)  \n    - [Covariance and Correlation Statistical Analysis](#Covariance and Correlation Statistical Analysis)\n"}}
