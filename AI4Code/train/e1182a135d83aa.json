Asymmetry is observed.\nAverage and median book ratings are 1.66 x 10^8.\nThere are outliers in the data. There are a small number of books in the data above the 9.3 x 10^6 rating which is the 50 percentile.\n\nYearlyChange:\n\nData is not distributed normally. Asymmetry is observed.\nThe data has a wide range.\nThere are many outliers in the data. There are a small number of countries whose annual change in emissions is above the 75 percentile.\n\nPer Capita:\n\nThe mean of the data is around 4.77\nData is not distributed normally. Asymmetry is observed.\nThere are countries that have much higher than the average amount of per capita emission, as well as countries with as low per capita emssion as 0.03.There are countries that have much higher than the average per capita emission as high as 37. This happens because a large variation in the population size of the countries considered.\n\nPopulation:\n\n75% of countries have a population of 7.5 x 10^7.

However there are other factors also which affect the life expectancy such as healthcare infrastructure, measures taken for curbing the emitted Co2, lifestyle, dieatry habits, standard of living and much more. Thus Life Expectancy depends on many such factors other than per capita emission. As we saw that Hongkong doesnt have one of the least Percapita Co2 emission but still has the highest life expectancy. In the same way Central African Republic has much less Percapita Co2 Emission but has the least LifeExpectancy.

Most of this countries being the part of Paris Agreement have taken intensive measures to curb the emission of Co2 by large amount. USA though withdrawing from the Paris Agreement has still managed to reduce the emission of Co2 by significant amount.\n\nIt can be seen that the major developed countries have taken significant efforts in curbing the Co2 emission, however it can be assumed that the countries with good per capita emission have not taken up any measures as they are majorly the Oil producing countries with not much Infrastructure and Research backing for reducing the Co2 Emissions.","451fea02":"# Top Countries to have maximum reduction in Yearly Carbon Dioxide Emissions.
