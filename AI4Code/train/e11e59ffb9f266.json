They found that Chinese participants were less willing to sacrifice one person to save five others, and less likely to consider such an action to be right.  This cultural difference was more pronounced when the consequences were less severe than death.","0339bde1":"Image facebook.com","8c12435f":"Image automotive-iq.com","e935d39d":"Image shikharsachdev.com","f4df0f6c":"Kaggle Notebook Runner: Mar\u00edlia Prata @mpwolke","fd26f3c5":"Image dribble.com - Trolley Dilemma Website by Josh Dean.","4a2d5f36":"Image 9changes.com - The Trolley Problem-An Ethical Conundrum.","030a3f5e":"* Image technologyreview.com - Should a self-driving car kill the baby or the grandma?

It is generally considered to represent a classic clash between two schools of moral thought, utilitarianism and deontological ethics. The general form of the problem is this: \n* There is a runaway trolley barreling down the railway tracks. Ahead, on the tracks, there are five people tied up and unable to move. The trolley is headed straight for them. You are standing some distance off in the train yard, next to a lever. If you pull this lever, the trolley will switch to a different set of tracks. However, you notice that there is one person on the side track. You have two options: \n* Do nothing and allow the trolley to kill the five people on the main track.\n* Pull the lever, diverting the trolley onto the side track where it will kill one person.\n* Which is the more ethical option? Or, more simply: What is the right thing to do? \nhttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Trolley_problem","fca5e1ca":"Image goodreads.com"}}
