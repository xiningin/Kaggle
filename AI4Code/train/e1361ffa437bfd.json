Try to visualize correlations between various features and grades and see which features have a significant impact on grades. \nTry to engineer the three grade parameters (G1, G2 and G3) as one feature for such comparisons.\n\n","cd1322e1":"We can see that the date doesn't influence severity. Hence all values of dat, time can be conveniently removed.","99954477":"We can see that absences is skewed. To remove skew we apply log transform. But before checking skew, let's check if there are any  outliers","5676dd85":"### Scatter plots will hep us capture relationships between famrel and cohabitation status with grades","dd0ba62a":"Wage Value and Release Clause are of money type and hence have to be converted into float.\n### The following function will preprocess the money type and will convert into float.

The worst grade of MS school is still better than some of the students from GP.\n* Student from GP has the best grade\n* While the range might be different, the median is almost the same for both the schools","044b3334":"### 3. On each day of the week, what is the maximum and minimum speed limit on the roads the accidents happened?","12243ab4":"Fill all the null values with the most frequent category.","111b33af":"We analyse the features by a scatterplot of wages vs some features.\nAccording to my intuition, Sprint speed, overall and potential must affect the wage. ","d6523922":"Min and max speed limit almost remains the same i.e 10 and 70 respectively for all days except for Thursday when the min speed limit is 20\nThis shows that speed limit is not dependent on the week of the day.\n\nBoxplot can be used to get a better visualisation of the same!"}}
