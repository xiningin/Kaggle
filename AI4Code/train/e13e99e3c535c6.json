Linear models\n5. Correlation of spread between countries\n6. Conclusion","243949d8":"# 1. What is Covid-19?\nCovid-19 or Coronavirus disease is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. It was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. As of May 15 2020 more than 4 million confirmed cases and more than 300K deaths over 188 countries. The person infected with this virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.\n\nThe COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes. It is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although spread is possible before symptoms appear, and from people who do not show symptoms. The standard method of diagnosis is by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from a nasopharyngeal swab. At this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for COVID-19. There are many ongoing trials and researches evaluating potential treatment.\n\n\n","95025525":"This regression analysis doesnt do well with the number of deaths. Initially the total number of people died were less. This is when the disease spread only across China. Still China have only around 4000 deaths for 80,000 cases. When the disease spread to some other European countries and USA total number of deaths increased exponentially. This recent change is not captured by the regression algorithms. More data analysis is to be done to set the right parameters for the graph. The parameter can be changed accordingly in the above code. Various parameters like RIDGE_DEGREE and ALPHA values can be altered. The data transformation used for this data is polynomial transform. The Degree of the transformation can be changed accordingly. \n\nThe average age in italy is around 47 and in other countries it is much lower. In India it is around 27. This explains why italy has more deaths than any other countries and number of deaths in India is lesser eventhough the number of cases is higher.","af35da2f":"# 3. World Statistics\n\n"}}
