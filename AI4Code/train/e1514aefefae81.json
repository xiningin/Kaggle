The procedure has a single parameter called k that refers to the number of groups that a given data sample is to be split into. As such, the procedure is often called k-fold cross-validation\n## In this process, we measure the Training Error by calculating the difference between predicted response and original response. But this metric cannot be trusted because it works well only with the training data. It\u2019s possible that the model is Underfitting or Overfitting the data.","bef726f5":"###  This technique is a hybrid of traditional train-test splitting and the k-fold cross-validation method. In this technique, we create random splits of the data in the training-test set manner and then repeat the process of splitting and evaluating the algorithm multiple times, just like the cross-validation method.","14adb535":"<h1 style=\"font-family:verdana;\"> <center>\ud83d\udcda Types-Of-Cross-Validation\ud83d\udcda<\/center> <\/h1>\n\n***","6461df1d":"<h1 id=\"markup\" style=\"font-family:verdana; font-size:30px;  \"> \n    <center> THANK YOU SO MUCH\n        \n<\/h1>","ddad2762":" <h1 id=\"markup\" style=\"font-family:verdana;\"> \n    <center>Stratified K-fold Cross Validation\n        \n<\/h1>","a5a7cecc":"![1-Cross-Validation.png](attachment:ca708a8c-0744-450d-b4e3-2caf3dfd755a.png)"}}
