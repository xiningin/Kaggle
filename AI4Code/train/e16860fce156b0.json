It generates a variety of visualizations and statistics which enables the user to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the column distributions and their relationships. The following describes the functionality of plot() for a given dataframe df.\n\nThey start by calling plot(df) which computes dataset-level statistics, a histogram for each numerical column, and a bar chart for each categorical column. The number of bins in the histogram can be specified with the parameter bins, and the number of categories in the bar chart can be specified with the parameter ngroups. If a column contains missing values, the percent of missing values is shown in the title and ignored when generating the plots.\n\nhttps:\/\/sfu-db.github.io\/dataprep\/user_guide\/eda\/plot.html","3a958b32":"#Top \u2018k\u2019 attributes\u2019 correlation heatmap (here, k=1)","9f704a5c":"#<b><mark style=\"background-color: #9B59B6\"><font color=\"white\"> create_report: generate profile reports from a Pandas dataframe.<\/font><\/mark><\/b>\n\nThe goal of create_report is to generate profile reports from a pandas DataFrame. create_report utilizes the functionalities and formats the plots from dataprep.
