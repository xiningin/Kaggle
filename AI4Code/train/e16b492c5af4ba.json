And for those who do not always have access to the latest packages or best practice in their day jobs.\n\n**Background:**\nI'd met QuantumBlack at one of their Meetups earlier this year and have been waiting for them to release kedro. I've decided to give it a go and make it work on Kaggle!\n\nThe example below is lifted from their 'Hello World' example and adapted to work on Kaggle. "}}
