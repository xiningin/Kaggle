But absolute value of correlation is not high, so we can not rely on this hypothesis.\n\nFunny fact, that from heatmap we can see that person with standart lunch shows better results than the person with reduced free lunch, especialy in math test!\n\nWe clearly see that test score does not really rely on parental education.\n\nProbably females study better than males\n\nPerfoming good at reading makes you good at writing and vice versa.
