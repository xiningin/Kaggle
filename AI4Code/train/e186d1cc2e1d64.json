We predict nine exam-level and one image-level label, where some of the labels are conflicting and must adhere to a specific hirearchy displayed on the image below.\n\n![hierarchy](https:\/\/www.googleapis.com\/download\/storage\/v1\/b\/kaggle-user-content\/o\/inbox%2F115173%2Fa2a5ee66b5799274141dd547cc3ea466%2FPE%20figure.jpg?generation=1599575183749576&alt=media)\n\nAccording to the data description page: \n\n> Winning submissions will be inspected to ensure label predictions adhere to the expected label hierarchy defined by the diagram on the Data page. The metric intends to heavily penalize submissions which mis-predict in this manner, however due to the complexity of predictions at both image and study levels and as an extra precaution, the host will verify that prospective winners have not made conflicting label predictions. The requirements which submissions will be held to are [specified by the host in this post](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/rsna-str-pulmonary-embolism-detection\/discussion\/183473).\n\nThe goal of this notebook is to develop a code that checks for label consistency in a submission file to make sure it adheres to the competition rules. Please note that the code has not been fully verified with the organizers yet and can be interpreting some of the rules incorrectly. I will be happy to correct any inconsistencies you might find if you point me to them in the comments section :)","510f8bad":"# CHECKING CONSISTENCY\n\n## PREPARATION","155892a7":"# WRAPPING IN A FUNCTION\n\nThe function below wraps the previous code blocks into a function that can be applied to a submission file.","984a60b9":"As you can see, the submission file has 26081 rows that do not satisfy the rule labeled as 2b. This means that, although the exam does not have any images with predicted PE (i.e., p(`pe_present_on_image`) > 0.5), some of the positive-related labels describing the characteristics of PE have p > 0.5. In my understanding, these inconsistencies should be fixed in order not to be disqualified from the leaderboard.","7f8665c0":"Now we can check label consistency rules separately for positive and negative exams. We will identify rows that do not satisfy any of the requirements and merge them into a data frame representing the inconsistent predictions.","b10b64d9":"## FORMALIZING CONSISTENCY RULES\n\nThe rules below represent my understanding of the label consistency requirements outlined by [@anthracene](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/anthracene) in [this discussion topic](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/rsna-str-pulmonary-embolism-detection\/discussion\/183473). I encourage you to read the topic before inspecting the rules below.\n\nWe implement the following two groups of rules on the exam level. The first group specifies conflicting characteristics of PE if it is detected on any of the images in the exam. The second group makes sure that if there are no images with detected PE in the exam, we do not predict any of the PE charactersitcs to be present.\n\n1. If there is at least one image per `StudyInstanceUID` with `pe_present_on_image` > 0.5, then:\n    - either `rv_lv_ratio_lt_1` or `rv_lv_ratio_gte_1` must have p > 0.5; both cannot have p > 0.5.\n    - at least one of `central_pe`, `rightsided_pe` and `leftsided_pe` must have p > 0.5; multiple having p > 0.5 is allowed.\n    - `acute_and_chronic_pe` and `chronic_pe`: only one of them can have p > 0.5; neither having p > 0.5 is allowed.\n2. If there are no images per `StudyInstanceUID` with `pe_present_on_image` > 0.5, then:\n    - either `indeterminate` or `negative_exam_for_pe` must have p > 0.5; both cannot have p > 0.5.\n    - all positive-related labels: `rv_lv_ratio_lt_1`, `rv_lv_ratio_gte_1`, `central_pe`, `rightsided_pe`, `leftsided_pe`, `acute_and_chronic_pe` and `chronic_pe` must have p < 0.5.","89186a4e":"Let's import one of the public kernel submission files to check it for the label consistency requirements.
