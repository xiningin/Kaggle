Using Describe method we could find out the max value. Let's find this large text message :\nYou can grab your data frame and spacify your condition to find it:","3cbfcf9c":"After the counting, the term weighting and normalization can be done with [TF-IDF](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tf%E2%80%93idf), using scikit-learn's `TfidfTransformer`.\n\n____\n### So what is TF-IDF?\nTF-IDF stands for *term frequency-inverse document frequency*, and the tf-idf weight is a weight often used in information retrieval and text mining. This weight is a statistical measure used to evaluate how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus. The importance increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document but is offset by the frequency of the word in the corpus. Variations of the tf-idf weighting scheme are often used by search engines as a central tool in scoring and ranking a document's relevance given a user query.\n\nOne of the simplest ranking functions is computed by summing the tf-idf for each query term; many more sophisticated ranking functions are variants of this simple model.\n\nTypically, the tf-idf weight is composed by two terms: the first computes the normalized Term Frequency (TF), aka. the number of times a word appears in a document, divided by the total number of words in that document; the second term is the Inverse Document Frequency (IDF), computed as the logarithm of the number of the documents in the corpus divided by the number of documents where the specific term appears.\n\n**TF: Term Frequency**, which measures how frequently a term occurs in a document. Since every document is different in length, it is possible that a term would appear much more times in long documents than shorter ones. Thus, the term frequency is often divided by the document length (aka. the total number of terms in the document) as a way of normalization: \n\n*TF(t) = (Number of times term t appears in a document) \/ (Total number of terms in the document).*\n\n**IDF: Inverse Document Frequency**, which measures how important a term is. While computing TF, all terms are considered equally important. However it is known that certain terms, such as \"is\", \"of\", and \"that\", may appear a lot of times but have little importance. Thus we need to weigh down the frequent terms while scale up the rare ones, by computing the following: \n\n*IDF(t) = log_e(Total number of documents \/ Number of documents with term t in it).*\n\nSee below for a simple example.\n\n**Example:**\n\nConsider a document containing 100 words wherein the word cat appears 3 times. \n\nThe term frequency (i.e., tf) for cat is then (3 \/ 100) = 0.03. Now, assume we have 10 million documents and the word cat appears in one thousand of these. Then, the inverse document frequency (i.e., idf) is calculated as log(10,000,000 \/ 1,000) = 4. Thus, the Tf-idf weight is the product of these quantities: 0.03 * 4 = 0.12.\n____\n\nLet's go ahead and see how we can do this in SciKit Learn:","50e1bca2":"Now we can directly pass message text data and the pipeline will do our pre-processing for us! We can treat it as a model\/estimator API:","dc6ffdbc":"Each vector will have as many dimensions as there are unique words in the SMS corpus.  We will first use SciKit Learn's **CountVectorizer**. This model will convert a collection of text documents to a matrix of token counts.\n\nWe can imagine this as a 2-Dimensional matrix. Where the 1-dimension is the entire vocabulary (1 row per word) and the other dimension are the actual documents, in this case a column per text message. \n\nFor example:\n\n<table border = \u201c1\u201c>\n<tr>\n<th><\/th> <th>Message 1<\/th> <th>Message 2<\/th> <th>...<\/th> <th>Message N<\/th> \n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Word 1 Count<\/b><\/td><td>0<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>...<\/td><td>0<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Word 2 Count<\/b><\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>...<\/td><td>0<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>...<\/b><\/td> <td>1<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>...<\/td><td>0<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Word N Count<\/b><\/td> <td>0<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>...<\/td><td>1<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n\n\nSince there are so many messages, we can expect a lot of zero counts for the presence of that word in that document. Because of this, SciKit Learn will output a [Sparse Matrix](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sparse_matrix).","d80040a6":" Now, we have the most important words.

Basically, it has a bunch of similar words such as 'ranning', 'ran', 'run'  , and stemming tries to break all of these down and retuns only 'run'. Teekay comes with a lot of dictionaries and built in data sets and corpuses and references for doing this porpuse.However, for our dataset stemming might not works well.
