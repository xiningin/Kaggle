The Louvain method maximizes a modularity score for each community or group of authors, which quantifies how \"good\" the communities are. (It does this by evaluating how much more densely connected the nodes within a community are, compared to how connected they would be in a random network.)\n\nNetwork visualizations can be difficult and confusing. There are several possible layouts, but we'll use the \"spring layout\" which results in a more aesthetic graph.","72ae47b9":"The colourful visualization above reveals communities of co-authors in the network. Note that these are not fixed positions or shapes of the communities. The graph can look different each time.\n\nWe've analysed relationships between authors by computing and visualizing centralities in the co-author network. Next, we'll use NLTK and Gensim to preprocess and performing topic modelling on the academic journal data.\n\n## Topic Modelling\n\nThe Metaknowledge function forNLP() creates a Pandas-friendly dictionary where each row is a record from the RecordCollection, and the columns contain textual data (id, title, publication year, keywords and the abstract). Its results are *not* reproducible - the records appear to be shuffled each time.\n\nBefore we proceed, here's an overview of the ideas behind topic modelling with LDA:\n\n- Latent Dirichlet Allocation is a probabilistic model that generates topic-document and word-topic probability distributions. Topics are themes that occur in documents, and each word in a document belongs to some topic. \n- The word \"latent\" refers to the topics, which are hidden, while Dirichlet refers to the probability distribution over 'k' number of topics. Allocation refers to the process of assigning topics to documents and words to topics. \n- This allocation is an iterative process in which an initial topic distribution is assumed, and the weights for each word are updated till the model converges.\n- LDA tries to allocate words to a fewer number of topics in each document, and tries to assign high probabilities to only a few words within each topic. These are conflicting goals and the tradeoff results in groups of co-occuring words.\n- The model produces topics by inferring the conditional or posterior distribution over the latent variables, given the observed words and parameters.","5ae5fbe9":"The data is currently stored as a RecordCollection object and must be converted into a dataframe if we want to see its contents. We can do this in two ways: with Pandas or with Metaknowledge's makeDict() function.","d0fc1edf":"There are 21943 unique words in the text. We'll filter out infrequent and overly frequent words from the dictionary, as this can improve the topic model.","aa5475af":"The top 3 authors in the co-author network are the same as the top 3 authors in the original Record Collection. However, there are 5 authors in the original top 10 who are missing from the top 10 co-authors. \n\nLet's calculate the solo authorship and co-authorship rates for these 10 authors.","9180c4b1":"# Bibliometric network analysis & topic modelling\n\nBibliometric data from academic databases can be used to find relationships between metadata (authors, titles, citations etc.) and discover dominant topics. In this kernel, we'll use the Metaknowledge package and an information science and bibliometrics dataset from Web of Science to perform network analysis and LDA topic modelling, along with visualizations. We'll try and answer the following questions:\n\n1. Which of the top authors are also top co-authors?\n2. What does the co-authorship network look like?\n3. What are the dominant topics that emerge from these academic papers?\n\nThe data and tutorials are available at https:\/\/github.com\/mclevey\/metaknowledge_article_supplement.","b010c7c2":"## Network Analysis\n\nNetwork analysis lets us see the relationships, distances and co-occurrences between the nodes in a network. Here's how we can conduct a network analysis of co-authors in this dataset.","98ef294e":"The topics look well-defined and cohesive (remember we are using an Information Science and Bibliometrics dataset). Finally, we'll create an interactive visualization of the model that shows inter-topic distances and topic-word distributions.","13390c61":"The makeDict() function gets rid of the id column and rearranges some columns, but the data is essentially the same. The two-letter variable names are tags used by Web of Science. See their description here - https:\/\/images.webofknowledge.com\/images\/help\/WOK\/hs_alldb_fieldtags.html\n\nMetaknowledge also provides the handy function glimpse() to view the top authors, journals and citations in the database.","5477b625":"We are left with 265 authors, all of whom have at least two co-authors. We can see the graph density has gone up because of our filtering criteria.\n\nCentrality is a key concept in network analysis. The degree, closeness, betweenness and eigenvector centralities tell us which nodes (authors) are the most important. These are calculated from the number of links to other nodes, the length of the paths to other nodes, the number of times the node acts as a bridge along the shortest path between other nodes, and the relative influence of the node, respectively.\n\nLet's compute the centrality scores in our co-author graph.","48257570":"There are 10104 nodes (authors) in the network who are connected by 15507 edges. Of these authors, 1111 are isolates (unconnected to others).\n\nNext, we will drop self-loops and any authors with fewer than 2 edges (co-authors). For our analysis we will extract the \"giant component\", which is the largest subgraph of connected nodes in a network graph. The giant component typically contains a significant proportion of the nodes in the network. We'll use Python's networkx package for this and subsequent tasks."}}
