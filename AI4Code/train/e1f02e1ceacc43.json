Store the output in some way that allows you to select the value of `max_leaf_nodes` that gives the most accurate model on your data.","a6d1949a":"# Exercises\nYou could write the function `get_mae` yourself.

If you were going to deploy this model in practice, you would make it even more accurate by using all of the data and keeping that tree size.  That is, you don't need to hold out the validation data now that you've made all your modeling decisions."}}
