Its aim is to analyze how casual and annual riders use bicycle sharing differently. By completing this analysis, it can help marketing strategies for the future. Initially, one approach that company applied that helped make things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans such as;\n\n   * **Single ride passes**\n   * **Full-day passes**\n   * **Annual memberships**\n\nOne thing that informed the marketing team was annual members are more profitable than casual riders. Although, the flexibility of its pricing attract more customers and while keeping this mind, primary stakeholders believe that maximizing the annual members will be the to key-factor to growth in the future and they want casual riders to be converted into the annual members rathan creating a marketing campaign. \n\n\n### **Business Tasks**\n\nThe goal of this project is to utilise the existing historical public data and form marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders in the annual riders. In order to do that, marketing needs to evaluate how casual and annual riders differ, why casual riders would probably buy annual memberships, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. \n\n* **How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?**\n* **Why would casual riders buy cyclistic annual memberships?**\n* **How can Cyclistic use digital media platforms to influence casual riders to become annual members?**","c642f5e6":"## **<span style=\"color:#0984e3\"> Ask Phase <\/span>**\n* **\n\nIn this phase, understanding the problem statement and context, aliging a right set of questions with the business objective, keeping audience expectations in the flow, and continued focus on collaboration with stakeholders and keep an open line of communication is the first step of analysis. \n\nIn this project, we will go through the business stated above and find out the key findings that will help us give the applicable recommendations to the team. \n\nIt is quite important to understand your stakeholders and their expectations.
