Inspired by Amazon's e-commerce model, the pair explored various portable items they could use to sell over the internet in a similar fashion.\n\nAfter initially considering and rejecting VHS cassettes, they settled on DVDs as the perfect product. After testing their idea by posting one to their homes in Santa Cruz, and it arriving in perfect condition, they decided the time was right to break into the market with their new revolutionary model.\n\nNetflix launched in April of 1998 and became the world's first online DVD rental and merchant.
