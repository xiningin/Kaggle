Similar situation arises for another 40 machines. So, basically, 80 machines out of 100 machines in our dataset have a maintenance time of 40 minutes or lower. Great observation! Lets justify with a cumulative graph. \n","25ddfb50":"## Import the dataset & necessary libraries","2bb6ec92":"### Business Perspective","160afffd":"# Data Exploration by Histogram & Cumulative graph"}}
