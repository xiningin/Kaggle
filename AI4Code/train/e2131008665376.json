I come from Vietnam. Today I will analyze the Kaggle Survey 2020 on Vietnamse.  \nNOTE: all assumptions here about Kagglers\/people are all only Vietnamese. I do not mean the general case at all.\n\nSome personal notes before we start about ML in Vietnam:\n- ML\/DL or related fields are quite new in Vietnam. Only in the past 3 years that schools\/universities start to develop a Data Science learning path.\n- I as a Software Engineering student, is also taught basic ML algorithms, but only up to Perceptron (few nodes of Neural Net).\n- I find very few to no ML textbooks in bookstores.\n- Companies start to grow fast, and they notice the impact of data, so many ML jobs are highly compensated, but in short demand.\n- A proud mention: about 2 (or 3) years ago, Vietnam's first AI research lab VinAI founded, and in 1 year they wrote a paper accepted at ICML! https:\/\/www.vinai.io\/an-overview-of-icml-2020s-publications\/\n\nThese reasons are (but not limited to) motivation that I do this analysis. Kaggle is one of the most well-known ML platforms, so I think I will find interesting things about ML career of Vietnamese here based on the survey.","dffc931c":"## Q2: What is your gender?","e8dce90b":"## Q18: Which categories of computer vision methods do you use on a regular basis?","6cae3871":"# Update and prepare libraries","d72bf119":"## Q15: For how many years have you used machine learning methods?","a0ca4e28":"To further discover how many languages do a person know, I have a hypothesis:\n- A lot of people will know 1-3 languages, because Python, C\/C++, Java and SQL are commonly taught","ae4e4df0":"We see:\n- Scikit-learn is still very popular.

Maybe the drawback of tree-based models is obvious (cannot extrapolate predictions)","1aa0b53d":"We see that:\n- Logistic and Linear Regression are the most popular.

That I think explains why DecisionTree\/RF is the next.\n- (Very) DL methods like BERT, GPT3 are not popular.
