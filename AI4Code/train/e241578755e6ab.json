Examined coefficients with post-hoc chi-square test for independence: Given a indicator value (e.g.,having_chest_pain==0), whether gender and disease presence are independent. \n### NB: The goal here is to examine potential different heart disease indicators in each gender. It is NOT the current goal to examine the underlying physiological mechanisms of each disease indicators.\n\n# Results:\n## 1. Both gender groups achieved higher than chance accuracy (>80%).\n## 2. Indicators common in both groups.\n### - Thalassemia (thal): reversable blood flow defect present (thal==3), likely NO heart disease (NB: Some other notebooks indicated this feature standed for Thalassemia, but I can't find official information, and given Thalassemia is a specific genetic blood disorder, the values do not seem to make sense. In either case, I don't tend to intepret the physiological bases here)\n\n\n## 3. Distinct indicators between genders.\n\n### a. Chest pain (cp):\n#### - Female: \"pain without relation to angina\"(cp==2), likely heart disease.\n#### - Male: Absent of chest pain (cp==0), likely NO heart disease\n### ==> i.e., For male, whether pain is present is a good indicator already, whereas for female that's not enough and more specific kind of pain is needed. \n### NB: There seem to be inconsistencies in the meanings of the values. Here assuming: 0=absent, 1=atypical angina, 2=related to angina, 3=typical angina. Again we don't intend to interpret the actual physiological bases but focus on difference between the genders.\n\n### b. Major vessels seen on flouroscopy (ca)\n#### - Female: No vessels seen (ca==0), likely heart disease (similar trend for Male but smaller effect). \n#### - Male (ca==2): 2 vessels seen, likely NO disease (marginal, p=0.06)\n\n### c. Thalassemia (thal): \n#### - Female: fixed deffect (thal==2), likely heart disease (similar trend for Male but smaller effect).\n\n### d. Slope (of the peak exercise ST segment):\n#### Female: ascending slope, likely heart disease.\n#### Male: flat slope, likely NO heart disease.\n### ==> The shape of the slope peak is very different in male and female.\n\n# Conclusions and Discussion\n## The indicators of heart disease showed very different degrees of sensitivity in men and women. In particular,\n## a) In men, absence of chest pain reliably indicated no disease, whereas in women that was not sufficient, and more speficic type of chest pain indicated presence of disease.\n## b) Regarding the number of vessels seen on flouroscopy, for men, absence of disease should have 2 vessels visible on the image, whereas for women, it only needs to be greater than 0.\n## c) Men and women showed distinct shapes of slope of the peak exercise ST segment. For men, a flat shape is a strong indicator of no disease, whereas for women an ascending shape indicated presence of disease.
