likely they are diabetic. Next we are going to create some features to do additional analysis.","782f8cb7":"We can see that most females have 0-2 babies. We can also so see that having high number of pregnancy increases the risk of diabetes significantly.\n\n### What is the effect of BMI on the Outcome?","bb3d5fae":"We can see that people above the cut off have a higher probability of having diabetes.\n\n## Model Prediction\n\nFor modelling we are going to keep it simple and use XGB classifier without any ensembling or hyperparamter optimization. We are not going to use any cross validation k-fold sets due to the very low number of inputs in this dataset.","3400d542":"We have 768 patients in the dataset and 9 columns. Lets discuss each column one by one.\n\nPregnancies is the number of times a person was pregnant. It's important to know the number of times a woman has become pregnant because each pregnancy has the risk of developing gestional diabetes (GDM) which itself is a risk factor for diabetes (DM). \n\nGlucose is the measure of plasma (or blood) glucose 2 hours after a oral glucose test. The elevated levels of glucose after 2 hours indicates impaired insulin function which can be a diagnostic for diabetes.\n\nBlood pressure itself can't be used to determine if one has diabetes or not, but high blood pressure usually coexists with diabetes.\n\nSkinThickness is how thick the tricep skin fold is. This test is a surrogate measure for body fat composition. Diabetics usually have high body fat.\n\nInsulin is the insulin level, 2 hours after ingesting oral glucose.\n\nBMI is body mass index. This column informs us if the patient is overweight for their height. Being overweight is a risk factor for diabetes.\n\nAge is self-explanatory. Diabetes is more common in the elderly due to various reasons.\n\nOutcome is the target variable. It tells us if someone has diabetes or not.\n\n## EDA\n\nLets explore each column and see how well correlated they are to the outcome.","f80a2738":"We can see from the curve that our model is somewhat good in it's prediction. AUC is above the red line where AUC = 0.5, meaning that the classifer has a slightly higher true positive rate than false positive rate. However we ideally want our ROC-AUC closer to the top left corner where F would equal 1. In this cases the classifer would correctly classify all entries correctly. This unrealistic standard to acheive but we can still try to improve our model through feature selection.\n\n## Feature Selection\n\nFor feature selection we are going to use the properties of xgb_clf.feature_importances_ to choose the top 3 features to use in out model.","cb4bbe36":"We can see that our F score is some where around ~0.57-0.70. However the F score is hard to interpet and doesnt tell us if our model's sensitivity or specificity. Lets instead use a AUC-ROC curve to get more details of our model.","8dfba6c5":"As we can see most of the variables are waekly correlated with Outcome. Glucose highly correlates with the outcome. Insulin surprisingly correlates more with SkinThickness than with Outcome. This could be due to the fact since high body fat is known to cause increased insulin resistance which leads to the pancreas to release more insulin. Increased SkinThickness leads to increased body fat.\n\nLets plot each column with outcome and deeply explore their relationship\n\n\n### What is the distribution of number of pregnancies?\n### What is the effect of number of pregnancies on the outcome?","1e3fbd5b":"## Feature engineering\n\nLarge waist circumference (WC) is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Large WC can also be an indicator for diabetes. WC measures abdominal obesity, and abdominal obesity is linked to numerous poor health outcomes such as metabolic disease, dyslipidemia, and high blood pressure.\n\nI have already talked about how to derive WC from BMI and Age in another notebook: Healthcare Dataset Stroke Data EDA and Modeling (https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/gundamb2\/cardio-eda-and-ensemble-methods). Please check notebook out for a more indepth explanation.\n\nPaper where this equation was obtained from: https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3441760\/","84d3a3e2":"We can see that XGB choose features that correlates closely with the Outcome. Lets pick the top 3 features (Glucose, BMI, and Age) and see if that improves out ROC-AUC curve."}}
