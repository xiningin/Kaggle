This metric typically varies from 0 (random agreement) to 1 (complete agreement). In the event that there is less agreement than expected by chance, the metric may go below 0.** \n\n**The quadratic weighted kappa is calculated as follows. First, an N x N histogram matrix O is constructed, such that $O_{i,j}$ corresponds to the number of `isup_grade`'s i (actual) that received a predicted value j. An N-by-N matrix of weights, w, is calculated based on the difference between actual and predicted values:**\n\n$$w_{i,j} = \\dfrac{(i-j)^2}{(N-1)^2}$$\n\n<br>\n\n**An N-by-N histogram matrix of expected outcomes, E, is calculated assuming that there is** ***no correlation*** **between values.This is calculated as the outer product between the actual histogram vector of outcomes and the predicted histogram vector, normalized such that E and O have the same sum. **\n\n<br>\n\nFinally, from these three matrices, the quadratic weighted kappa is calculated as:\n\n\n$$\\kappa = 1 - \\dfrac{\\sum_{i,j}\\text{w}_{i,j}O_{i,j}}{\\sum_{i,j}\\text{w}_{i,j}E_{i,j}}$$\n\nwhere $w$ is the weighted matrix, $O$ is the histogram matrix and $E$ being the expected matrix.","2ad61e4b":"We can check against `sklearn`.","605caf23":"## The Precision-Recall Tradeoff\n\nDoes this term reminisce with the Bias-Variance Tradeoff? \n\n---\n\nMore specifically, when we talk about precision and recall in the sections above, we are fixated at one decision threshold of our classifier. One should note that both metrics are parametrized by $t$, the decision threshold. We can tune our threshold to achieve a better precision or recall, but usually not both, hence the tradeoff.\n\n---\n\nWe can read more from [Google's Machine Learning Crash Course on Precison and Recall](https:\/\/developers.google.com\/machine-learning\/crash-course\/classification\/precision-and-recall).","6ae73916":"### Pros and Cons of AUROC\n\nBefore we go ham on the [Drawbacks of AUROC](https:\/\/stats.stackexchange.com\/questions\/193138\/roc-curve-drawbacks), we first try to think the following:\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n<b>Food For Thought:<\/b> I think intuitively you can say that if your model needs to perform equally well on the positive class as the negative class (for example, for classifying images between cats and dogs, you would like the model to perform well on the cats as well as on the dogs. For this you would use the AUROC.)<p>\n\nOn the other hand, if you're not really interested in how the model performs on the negative class, but just want to make sure every positive prediction is correct (precision), and that you get as many of the positives predicted as positives as possible (recall), then you should choose PRAUC (more with it later). For example, for detecting cancer, you don't care how many of the negative predictions are correct, you want to make sure all the positive predictions are correct, and that you don't miss any. (In fact, in this case missing a cancer would be worse than a false positive so you'd want to put more weight towards recall.)\n<\/div>","9fd48c39":"#### Step 5: Plot the points as ROC Curve\n\nThe main idea of ROC Curve is to plot various pairs of [TPR, FPR] at different threshold on the graph, as shown below. Note that we **reversed** our tpr and fpr to be in line with Scikit-Learn. It does not affect the end result.","a2c462c9":"## **Step 2: Create the Weighted Matrix w** <a id =\"weighted\"><\/a>","579594d0":"#### Pros: Classification Threshold Invariant\n\nAUC measures the quality of the model's predictions irrespective of what classification threshold is chosen. What this means is if you compare an example to accuracy, how do you compute it? You say that if threshold is more than $t$, then you proceed to calculate the accuracy score - and different threshold gives different accuracies. But in ROC, the nuance is that our final metric is area under the ROC curve, over various (all possible) thresholds $t$, so as you see, we do not depend on the threshold to calculate the final score! \n\nThis can also be a con when you want to specifically minimize one metric like False Negatives or False Positives. For example, in cancer detection where malignant is the positive class, you will likely want to minimize False Negatives, **even if it results in a huge increase in False Positives**, then ROC may not be best suited. So if you only have the ROC curve for analysis, then you can choose your threshold according to the curve, in this case we choose the point which maximizes TPR as maximizing TPR is equivalent to minimizng FN.","0aed3cfe":"#### Writing out the expected matrix in python\n\nSo to get the expected matrix, E, is calculated assuming that there is no correlation between values.  This is calculated as the outer product between the actual histogram vector of outcomes and the predicted histogram vector, normalized such that E and C have the same sum. Note carefully below that we do not need to normalize both, we just need to normalize E to the same sum as C.","ce42b7fe":"### Loss function and Decision Function\n\n[Loss function and decision Function link](https:\/\/stats.stackexchange.com\/questions\/104988\/what-is-the-difference-between-a-loss-function-and-decision-function)\n\nA **decision function** is a function which takes a dataset as input and gives a decision as output. What the decision can be depends on the problem at hand. Examples include:\n\n - *Estimation problems:* the \"decision\" is the estimate.\n - *Hypothesis testing problems:* the decision is to reject or not reject the null hypothesis. Think of Linear Regression problems, they are mostly related to hypothesis testing.\n - *Classification problems:* the decision is to classify a new observation (or observations) into a category.\n - *Model selection problems:* the decision is to chose one of the candidate models.\n\nTypically, there are an infinite number of decision functions available for a problem. If we for instance are interested in estimating the height of Swedish males based on ten observations $\\mathbf{x}=(x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_{10})$, we can use any of the following decision functions $d(\\mathbf{x})$:\n\n - The sample mean: $d(\\mathbf{x})=\\frac{1}{10}\\sum_{i=1}^{10}x_i$.\n - The median of the sample: $d(\\mathbf{x})=\\mbox{median}(\\mathbf{x})$\n - The geometric mean of the sample: $d(\\mathbf{x})=\\sqrt[10]{x_1\\cdots x_{10}}$\n - The function that always returns 1: $d(\\mathbf{x})=1$, regardless of the value of $\\mathbf{x}$. Silly, yes, but it is nevertheless a valid decision function.\n\nHow then can we determine which of these decision functions to use? One way is to use a **loss function**, which describes the loss (or cost) associated with all possible decisions. Different decision functions will tend to lead to different types of mistakes. The loss function tells us which type of mistakes we should be more concerned about. The best decision function is the function that yields the lowest **expected loss**. What is meant by expected loss depends on the setting (in particular, whether we are talking about [frequentist][1] or [Bayesian][2] statistics).\n\n**In summary:** \n\n - Decision functions are used to make decisions based on data.\n - Loss functions are used to determine which decision function to use.\n\n\n  [1]: http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Frequentist_inference\n  [2]: http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bayesian_statistics\n  \n","27eb622d":"### True Positive (TP)\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-success\">\n<b>Definition:<\/b> The ground truth is positive label and the predicted value from the classifier is also positive label.\n<\/div>\n","23ed9924":"### Definition\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-success\">\n    <b>Definition:<\/b> The F1 score is the <b>harmonic mean<\/b> between Precision and Recall, bounded between 0 and 1.\n<\/div>\n\n---\n\n$$F1 = \\dfrac{2(\\text{Precision} \\times \\text{Recall})}{\\text{Precision} + \\text{Recall}}$$\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\n<b>Example:<\/b> \nFor example, imagine that the blood protein levels in diseased people and healthy people are normally distributed with means of 2 g\/dL and 1 g\/dL respectively.

One last thing is about the predictions ordering, there is no rule that your predictions must SORT IN DESCENDING ORDER, for example: This will give you an AUC score of 1, even though it may not seem to predict everything correctly. Because the below order gives rise to the best AUC, which is 1 in this case, and hence this will give you 1 as well. If you switch a few numbers inside y_pred you will notice it can still stay at 1. However, if you reverse the list order, then you will get an AUC of 0 (the opposite of the best).\n\n```python\ny_true = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\ny_pred = [0.99999, 0.98, 0.97, 0.96, 0.95, 0.94, 0.68139, 0.50961, 0.48880, 0.44951]\nfull_score_example = sklearn.metrics.roc_auc_score(y_true, y_pred)  \nprint(full_score_example) -> 1\n```","27952333":"### AUROC as a Ranking \n\nOne confusing aspect of ROC space is the ranking system. This can be seen in the notebook I created here. Remember, if you code it out yourself from scratch, then it will be more beneficial as you can understand where ranking come into play (without using sklearn). The algorithm starts from the point where threshold is \\infty or in sklearn it starts with some other number. A threshold of infinity will guarantee that the point starts at (0,0). Thus, our very first point MUST start from the origin in this algorithm. Then assuming we do not consider an infinity number of thresholds, as this is too computationally expensive, we consider say 10 threshold values that we want to test (a common number is the number in the dataset). We divide the 10 values into 0.9,0.8,0.7,...,0.1, (for example only). Then we start from 0.9, the highest threshold, and move down to the lowest, in order (ranking). As we have seen just now, as you lower the threshold, both your TPR and FPR go up. Therefore, if you don't want to get your hands dirty, then the intuition is that if you have ground truth [0,1,1,0] and pred_1 = [0.03,0.99,0.05,0.06] and pred_2 = [0.15,0.92,0.89,0.91] then if you then imagine that your thresholds are given by thres_1 = [infinity,0.99,0.06,0.05,0.03] and thres_2 = [infinity, 0.92,0.91,0.89,0.15] , then you can calculate that the TPR and FPR rate at each of the threshold for both predictions are actually the same, consequently, forming the same ROC curve. (Consider plotting it). The idea here is we do not care what your values of the predictions are, in fact, in neural networks, transforming logits through softmax may not be a well calibrated (refer to my calibrated probability notes) probability anyways. We do however, care about the ranking, as you can see our thresholds are sorted in descending order, noticed that we only need that many thresholds for the dataset because only the thresholds at the predictions matter. If you take a number between 0.06 and 0.99 for the first threshold set, you will notice that between this threshold, the TPR and FPR will always be the same. Therefore, we conclude, without proof, that if two arrays of prediction has the exact same relative order, then the AUC for both predictions will be the same, which means that AUC is invariant to the scale of the predictions, and in fact invariant to any sort of transformation, that preserves the order (i.e. a non-negative linear transformation); (you can have numbers greater than 1 and the AUC will be the same try [100,200,150,160]).  A corollary of this is we can\u2019t treat outputs of an AUC-optimized model as the likelihood that it\u2019s true. Some models may be poorly calibrated (eg: its output is always between 0.3 and 0.32) but still achieve a good AUC score because its relative ordering is correct. This is something to look out for when blending together predictions of different models.\n\n<img src='https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/reigHns\/reighns-MLAlgorithms\/master\/reighns-metrics\/data\/images\/ranking_auc.png' width=\"390\" height=\"200\"\/>\n","8a8d8367":"### Implementation of Precision","aa80abdb":"### Probabilistic Interpretation\n\nOne can also interpret precision and recall not as ratios but as [estimations of probabilities](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Precision_and_recall), and assuming positive class is 1 and negative class is 0, and $\\hat{Y}$ is your estimate of ground truth $Y$.\n\n$ precision = \\frac{T_p}{T_p+F_p} = Pr(Y=positive | X\\hspace{1mm}is\\hspace{1mm}predicted\\hspace{1mm}as\\hspace{1mm}positive) = P(Y=1 | \\hat{Y} = 1)$\n\n- Precision is the estimated probability that a random point selected from the samples are positive.

Therefore, the true positive rate is given by $TPR(T) = \\int_{T}^{\\infty}f_1(x)dx$ and the false positive rate is given by $FPR(T) = \\int_{T}^{\\infty}f_0(x)dx$.

They are really good and the entire intuition is from him, I will almost use his intuition verbatim and everything in this section will be credited to the links above; I just find it too difficult to phrase it in my own words because their answers are perfect.\n\nBasically, let me put it up front now: ***Accuracy, Sensitivity and Specificity are one-sided or conditional versions of classification accuracy. As such they are also discontinuous improper accuracy scores, and optimizing them will result in the wrong model.***  \n\n\n\nThe `confusion matrix` and the `classification report` provide a very detailed analysis of a particular set of predictions. However, the predictions themselves already threw away a lot of information that is contained in the model - to explain this statement further: We consider the example of a logistic regression classifier, used to predict whether a patient has cancer (1, positive class) or not (0, negative class). We defined Y as our response variable, outputting only 1 or 0, while $X$ is the set of predictors.\n\nIn the case of our cancer classification model, (which we assume to be a logistic regression classifier), we remember that the positive class (class = 1) is the patient has cancer, and the negative class (class = 0) is the patient does not have cancer. And to delve a little deeper, our default classification threshold is:\n    \n$\\begin{equation}\n Y=\\begin{cases}\n1, & \\text{if $P(Y=1 ~|~X) \\geq 0.5$}\\\\\n0, & \\text{if $P(Y=1~|~X) < 0.5$}\\\\\n\\end{cases} \\end{equation}$\n\nwhich means that whenever our logistic regression outputs a probability of the patient getting cancer is more than $0.5$, we classify the patient to be in the positive class (predict him\/her to have cancer). When we use the `LogisticClassifier()` to fit and predict, we are actually predicting the probability $p(X)$, i.e.the probability of the patient having cancer given predictors X; Consequently, we need to further set a threshold, or to make a decision on whether to classify a patient as cancer or benign based on the probability we get from $$p(X) = \\dfrac{e^{\\beta_0}+\\beta_1X_1+...+\\beta_nX_n}{1+ e^{\\beta_0}+\\beta_1X_1+...+\\beta_nX_n}$$\n\nThe threshold is defaulted to 0.5 in `predict_proba`. As we discussed earlier, most classifiers provide a `decision_function` or a `predict_proba` method to assess degrees of certainty about predictions. Making predictions can be seen as thresholding the output of `decision_function` or `predict_proba` at a certain fixed point; in binary classification we use 0 for the decision function and 0.5 for predict_proba as default.\n\n\n<br>\n\n\nTo fully evaluate the effectiveness of a model, you must examine both precision and recall. Unfortunately, precision and recall are often in tension. That is, improving precision typically reduces recall and vice versa. Explore this notion by looking at the following figure, which shows 30 predictions made by an email classification model. Those to the right of the classification threshold are classified as \"spam\", while those to the left are classified as \"not spam.\"\n\nAlways remember, do not ever just use a single metric like `recall, precision` to gauge your classifier. This is because your classifier (say `SVM()` may somehow trivially classify everything as the positive class,  and then you will get 100% recall).","7a907356":"## **Step 4: Final Step: Weighted Kappa formula and Its python codes** <a id=\"qwk\"><\/a>\n \nFrom these three matrices: E, C and weighted, the quadratic weighted kappa is calculated as: \n\n$$\\kappa = 1 - \\dfrac{\\sum_{i,j}\\text{weighted}_{i,j}C_{i,j}}{\\sum_{i,j}\\text{weighted}_{i,j}E_{i,j}}$$\n\nNote that a higher value generally means your prediction model is way better than a random model, but there is no consensus on which value is really good or bad.","56b2aff9":"## **Step 1: Create the NxN histogram matrix O** <a id=\"confusion\"><\/a>","45dbe3b3":"#### Step 3: ROC score for each class\n\nAt this step, we calculate the ROC score for each class.

But what you should look at are ALL your classes. So for your negative class, your P = 0 and your R = 0. And you usually don't just look at PR scores individually. You want to look at F1-score (F1 macro or F1 micro, depending on your problem) that is a harmonic average of your PR scores for both class 1 and class 0. Your class 1 PR score is super good, but combine that with your class 0 PR score, your F1-score will be TERRIBLE, which is the correct conclusion for your scenario.\n\nTL,DR: Look at PR scores for ALL your classes, and combine them with a metric like F1-score to have a realistic conclusion about your model performance. The F1-score for your scenario will be TERRIBLE, which is the correct conclusion for your scenario.","72cb4d61":"## **Precision-Recall Curve**","980f131d":"First, an N x N confusion matrix **C** is constructed, such that $\\text{C}_{i,j}$ is the entry that corresponds to the **number of animal i (actual) that received a predicted value j**. ","1db491de":"### ROC as C-Statistic\n\nROC can be interpreted as [c-statistics](https:\/\/stats.stackexchange.com\/questions\/193138\/roc-curve-drawbacks).\nROC AUC has the property that it coincides with the $c$ statistic. The $c$ statistic measures the probability that a positive example is ranked higher than a negative example. In this sense, the ROC AUC answers the question of how well the model discriminates between the two classes.\n\nA model with high discrimination is not necessarily well calibrated. Suppose a logistic regression model predicts probabilities of 0.52 for positives and 0.51 for negatives (imagine 10 ground truth where 6 is positive and 4 is negative, then the author meant the associated probabilities with each of these ground truth is 0.52 and 0.51 respectively, for the positive and negative classes). This model has an AUC of 1 (recall you need not predict everything correctly to get an AUC of 1) but the probabilities aren't helpful in the sense of identifying which purported positives are highest-risk. Because all of the positives are assigned the same posterior probability, they can't be differentiated.\n\nMoreover, a well-calibrated model will have its maximum ROC AUC fixed by the ratio of positives to negatives in the data. This means that a model which has some very desirable probabilities (i.e. its posterior probabilities match the true probability) has a cap on its performance, and therefore an **uncalibrated** model could \"dominate\" in terms of ROC AUC.\n\nROC AUC doesn't tell you anything about the costs of different kinds of errors. For example, if you're trying to detect fraud, a 10,000 dollar purchase of uncertain provenance represents a larger potential loss than a 10 dollar purchase. But ROC AUC would treat both events as if they have the same weight -- obviously any reasonable model should be able to distinguish between these two types of error.\n\nROC AUC also tends to be dominated by the \"high FPR\" points. **Depending on the application, these points may be the least relevant.** Consider the case where the model is used to refer high-risk transactions to experts who will conduct further vetting. There may only be enough humans to assess 50 transactions per unit time; since the most highly-ranked transactions occur on the \"left hand\" size of the ROC curve by definition, this is also the region with the lowest area. So by looking at the whole AUC, you're optimistically biasing your results upwards, i.e. ROC AUC is buoyed by the observations \"to the right\" of the actual set of observations which humans will vet. (Illustration is simple. Draw a vertical line at FPR<0.5 on any ROC curve. The area to left is higher for all such vertical lines.) To avoid this, some people use partial ROC AUC, which has its own host of problems, chief among them that software implementations tend to assume that you're interested in truncation *at some value of FPR.* But in the case that you care about the top $n$ transactions, this approach is obviously wrong because the top $n$ transactions will happen at different FPR values for different classifiers. Standardization of partial AUC (to preserve the property that AUC < 0.5 is worse than random, 1 is perfect, 0 is worthless) incurs further difficulties.\n\nThe ROC curve itself is of little interest. \"Dominating\" classifiers can be assessed by AUC. Stochastic equivalence can be assessed by tests of equivalence of ranks. Prof. Harrell's comment drives at a consistent theme of his work, which is that the real question diagnostics should answer is one of risk assessment and utility optimization. Examining ROC AUC tends to encourage selection of truncation points, which should be avoided because it only provides partial information to decision makers.\n\nAlternative measures of performance (e.g. log-likelihood) characterize the calibration of the model and proper scoring rules generally have the quality that they encourage honest forecasts.","ae1ad209":"# Performance Metrics and Scoring\n\nIn almost all of Kaggle's competitions, the evaluation metric is given to us.

The graph also depicts the tradeoffs between TPR and FPR, much like the dilemma of the Bias-Variance tradeoff. Also note that in the ROC space, each point on the graph represents a threshold, and therefore each point can have its own confusion matrix as well.\n\nWe come up with an example from the [Melanoma Competition](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/siim-isic-melanoma-classification) where we denote a malignant cell to be 1, and benign to be 0. If we treat the **malignance class as positive class**, and the model you trained on outputs a probability vector (using softmax here) $[0.7, 0.3]$ corresponding to class 0 and 1 respectively, the value of 0.3 translates to saying that the image is 30% positive that it is malignant; in other words, it is 70% sure that this image is a benign cell. If we choose the default threshold to be the traditional $\\vec{thr}=0.5$, then the classifier will label this image as a $0$. This is because the thresholds defines our **hard label** from the **soft label**, and thus anything above the threshold 0.5, will be classified as a positive class 1, and negative class otherwise.\n\nIf however, you lower your classification threshold, say from 0.5 to 0.2, then our image will become now become positive class, indicating the image's cell to be malignant. Intuitively, the consequence is that more images will be classified to become positive as lowering the threshold will allow the model to predict true more often.

The TPR here is given by $\\frac{2}{4}$ since there are 4 positive ground truth, and among the predicted labels, the model correctly classify 2 positives correctly.

Therefore, without any proofs, just intuition, one should be convinced that if you lower the threshold, more patients will be classified as positive, consequently, the TPR and FPR both increase. Conversely, if you increase the threshold, then the TPR and FPR will both decrease.

This is an example of class imbalance where the ratio of class 1 to class 0 is $1:9$.\n<\/div>   \n    \nConsider **a baseline (almost trivial) classifier**:\n\n```python\ndef baselineModel(patient_data):\n        training...\n    return benign\n```\n        \n\nwhere we predict the patient's class as the most frequent class. Meaning, the most frequent class in this question is the class = 0, where patients do not have cancer, so we just assign this class to everyone in this set. By doing this, we will inevitably achieve a **in-sample** accuracy rate of $\\frac{90}{100} = 90\\%$. But unfortunately, this supposedly high accuracy value is completely useless, because this classifier did not label any of the cancer patients correctly.\n\nThe consequence can be serious, assuming the test set has the same distribution as our training set, where if we have a test set of 1000 patients, there are 900 negative and 100 positive. Our model just literally predict every one of them as benign, yielding a $90\\%$ **out-of-sample** accuracy.\n\nWhat did we conclude? Well, for one, our `accuracy` can be 90% high and looks good to the laymen, but it failed to predict the most important class of people - yes, misclassifying true cancer patients as healthy people is an **SERIOUS OFFENCE**. \n\nAlso, intuitively speaking, most models (without regularization), ***will not be robust to*** imbalanced dataset. This means that if you were given a training set that is highly imbalanced, then your \"logistic regression\" might give you an overly confident accuracy score on you validation set (if the validation set is also imbalanced).","28a59fc1":"### Example using our competition's dataset","bb0fb873":"# Quadratic Weighted Kappa\n\nThe below explanation will correspond to my [notebook during the PANDAS competition](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/reighns\/understanding-the-quadratic-weighted-kappa\/).","1d80bae8":" ## Table of Contents\n1.

In particular, when the positive class\n\nPrecision and recall, however, don't consider true negatives and thus won't be affected by the relative imbalance (which is precisely why they're used for imbalanced datasets). \n\n\n[Kaggle Forum](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/general\/7517#41179)\n\nAs goes for any metric, your metric depends entirely on what I you mean to do with the data.\n\nI think intuitively you can say that if your model needs to perform equally well on the positive class as the negative class (for example, for classifying images between cats and dogs, you would like the model to perform well on the cats as well as on the dogs. For this you would use the ROC AUC.\n\nOn the other hand, if you're not really interested in how the model performs on the negative class, but just want to make sure every positive prediction is correct (precision), and that you get as many of the positives predicted as positives as possible (recall), then you should choose PR AUC. For example, for detecting cancer, you don't care how many of the negative predictions are correct, you want to make sure all the positive predictions are correct, and that you don't miss any. (In fact, in this case missing a cancer would be worse then a false positive so you'd want to put more weight towards recall.)\n\nTrue negatives need to be meaningful for ROC to be a good choice of measure. In his example, if we've got 1,000 pictures of cats and dogs and our model determines whether the picture is a cat (target = 0) or a dog (target = 1), we probably care just as much about getting the cats right as the dogs, and so ROC is a good choice of metric.\n\nIf instead, we've got a collection of 1,000,000 pictures and we build a model to try to identify the 1,000 dog pictures mixed in it, correctly identifying \"not-dog\" pictures is not quite as useful. Instead, it makes more sense to measure how often a picture is a dog when our model says it's a dog (i.e., precision) and how many of the dogs in the picture set we found (i.e., recall).\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n<b>Perspective:<\/b> In the cancer example above, your AUROC score might be very bad, simply because your False Positives might be high, as a result of minimizing False Negatives, but your AUPRC might be good, because you are maximizing precision!\n<\/div>","7d70cb53":"### False Negative (FN)\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-success\">\n<b>Definition:<\/b> The ground truth is positive label and the predicted value from the classifier is negative label.\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n<b>Info:<\/b> This is also called the Type 2 Error.<\/div>\n","17444918":"### When to use Recall?\n\n- When your company needs you to ***restrict the number of False Negatives***.\n\n- Recall\/Sensitivity therefore quantifies the avoidance of False Negatives.\n\n### When to NOT use Recall?\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-danger\">\n<b>Danger:<\/b> \n<li> Notice that if a recall score is 1 for a class C where you treat class C as the positive class, you will know that $TP = TP + FN = 1 \\implies FN = 0$, there are 0 False Negatives, but this does not tell us **anything** about the False Positives.\n<li> When you prioritize precision more than recall for your business needs.\n<li> You almost never ever use `recall` as a single metric, see 2.5 for intuition.\n<\/div>\n\n---\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\n<b>Example:<\/b> For disease data modeling, anything that doesn't account for false-negatives is a crime.

Googling the idea of expected matrix is not apparently clear to me, but luckily someone pointed to me to read expected frequency of Chi-Square test and then and, there I start to slowly understand.\n\nFor the purpose of better understanding, we call our actual values to be rater A and our prediction model to be rater B. We want to quantify the agreement between rater A and rater B. Here are some terminologies to get hold of first.\n\n- There are a total number of $k = 5$ classes in this example;\n- There are a total number of $n = 10$ observations in this example;\n- Define Y to be the random variable that rater A has chosen (aka our actual classes 1,2,3,4,5);\n- and $\\widehat{Y}$ be the random variable that rater $B$ has chosen (aka our predicted classes 1,2,3,4,5 by rater B)\n- $r_i$ be the i-th entry of the column vector for actual value counts shown above, $c_i$ be the i-th entry of the column vector for prediction value counts shown above.\n<br>\n\nThen the probability of rater A choosing class 2 and rater B choosing class 2 for example, is given by $$P(Y = 2 \\text{ and } \\widehat{Y} = 2)  = P(Y = 2) \\cdot P(\\widehat{Y} = 2) = 30\\% \\times 40\\%  = 12\\%$$\n\nThis is under the assumption that both raters are **independent of each other**. Note that $P(Y = 2) = 30\\%$ because as we see from the actual value counts of rater $A$, there are a total of 3 class 2's and therefore the probability of Y being 2 is just the proportion. Similarly, we calculate $\\widehat{Y}$ the same way.\n\nIn general, the formula of rater A choosing class i and rater B choosing (predicting) class j is given as follows: $$P(Y = i \\text{ and }  \\widehat{Y} = j) =  P(Y = i) \\times P (\\widehat{Y} = j)$$\n\n<br>\n\n\nNow the real question comes: On average, if you have $n$ number of points to predict, how many times (what is the frequency) would you **expect** to see rater A choose class i and rater B choose class j.\n\nTo reiterate, recall that the probability of the actual class being 1 **and (super important word here, it means a joint distribution)** and the predicted class to be 1 as well is $P(Y = 1 \\text{ and }  \\widehat{Y} = 1)$, similarly, the probability of the actual class being 1 and the predicted class to be 2 is $P(Y = 1 \\text{ and }  \\widehat{Y} = 2)$. Generalizing, the probability of the actual class being $i$ and the predicted class being $j$ is the joint probability $$P(Y = i \\text{ and }  \\widehat{Y} = j)$$\n\nSo the intuition lies here: based on the joint probability above, what is the expected number of times (frequency) that $Y = i$ and $\\widehat{Y} = j$ happened (this means Y is i but rater B predict $\\widehat{Y}$ as j) out of 10 times? Easy, just use $n \\times P(Y = i \\text{ and }  \\widehat{Y} = j)$. So for rater B, our prediction model, **by just using theoretical probability**, should have $n \\times P(Y = i \\text{ and }  \\widehat{Y} = j)$ for each $i,j$. But in reality, this may not be the case. Reconcile this idea with the classic coin toss example:\n\n- **Example on coin toss:** Expected frequency is defined as the number of times that we predict an event will occur based on a calculation using theoretical probabilities. You know how a coin has two sides, heads or tails? That means that the probability of the coin landing on any one side is 50% (or 1\/2, because it can land on one side out of two possible sides). If you flip a coin 1,000 times, how many times would you expect to get heads? About half the time, or 500 out of the 1,000 flips. To calculate the expected frequency, all we need to do is multiply the total number of tosses (1,000) by the probability of getting a heads (1\/2), and we get 1,000 * 1\/2 = 500 heads. if event A has prob of p happening, and sample size of n, then the average or expected number of times that A happens is $np$. The expected frequency of heads is 500 out of 1,000 total tosses. The expected frequency is based on our knowledge of probability - we haven't actually done any coin tossing. However, if we had enough time on our hands, we could actually flip a coin 1,000 times to experimentally test our prediction. If we did this, we would be calculating the experimental frequency. The experimental frequency is defined as the number of times that we observe an event to occur when we actually perform an experiment, test, or trial in real life. If you flipped a coin 1,000 times and it landed on heads 479 times, then the experimental frequency of heads is 479.\n\n    But wait - didn't we predict the coin would land on heads 500 times? Why did it actually land on heads only 479 times? Well, the expected frequency was just that - what we expected to happen, based on our knowledge of probability. There are no guarantees when it comes to probability, what we expect to happen might differ from what actually happens. \n\n<br>\n\nSince we know $$E_{2,2} = 10 \\times P(Y = 2 \\text{ and } \\widehat{Y} = 2)  = 10 \\times P(Y = 2) \\cdot P(\\widehat{Y} = 2) = 10 \\times 30\\% \\times 40\\%  = 1.2$$\n\nThis $E_{2,2}$ means that we only expect the rater A to choose 2 and rater B to choose 2 at the same time only 1.2 times out of 10 times. In other words, our predicted model classify 2 as 2 1.2 times. However, from our observations in our matrix C (confusion\/histogram matrix), rater A choosing 2 and rater B choosing 2 have a frequency of 3! In other words, our predicted model classified 2 as 2 three times! So we kinda exceeded expectation for this particular configuration.\n\n$$C = \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\\n0 & 3 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\\n4 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}$$\n\nLet me give you one more example, $$E_{5,2} = 10 \\times P(Y = 5 \\text{ and } \\widehat{Y} = 2) = 10 \\times P(Y = 5) \\cdot P(\\widehat{Y} = 2) = 10 \\times 50\\% \\times 40\\%  = 2$$\n\nThis means that we only expect the rater A to choose 5 and rater B to choose 2 at the same time only 2 times out of 10 times! But in reality, our observations say that our rater B classified 5 as 2 zero times! \n\n\nWe calculate $E_{i,j}$ given by the formula: $$E_{i,j} = n \\times P(Y = i \\text{ and }  \\widehat{Y} = j) = n \\times P(Y = i) \\times P (\\widehat{Y} = j) = n \\times \\dfrac{r_i}{n} \\times \\dfrac{c_j}{n}$$\n\n$$E = \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\\n1.2 & 1.2 & 0.6 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0.4 & 0.4 & 0.2 & 0 & 0\\\\\n0.4 & 0.4 & 0.2 & 0 & 0\\\\\n2 & 2 & 1 & 0 & 0\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}$$\n\nNote $r_i \\times c_j$ is the $(i,j)$ entry of the outer product between the actual histogram vector of outcomes (actual value counts) and the predicted histogram vector (prediction value counts).","9dc10669":"Just a side note that one can also use SK learn's cohen_kappa_score function calculate the quadratic weighted kappa in this competition, with weights set to quadratic.

Of course, the data scientists in Preggie are smart, they evaluate their classifier\/model not by their `accuracy` but by their `precision` instead. \n\nThis is because they want to minimize their False Positives in their classifier.

In the binary and multilabel cases, these can be either probability estimates or non-thresholded decision values (as returned by decision_function on some classifiers). In the multiclass case, these must be probability estimates which sum to 1. The binary case expects a shape (n_samples,), and the scores must be the scores of the class with the greater label. The multiclass and multilabel cases expect a shape (n_samples, n_classes). In the multiclass case, the order of the class scores must correspond to the order of labels, if provided, or else to the numerical or lexicographical order of the labels in y_true.\n\nUnderstanding the binary case is important, it says that the binary case expects a list\/array of shape `(n_samples,)`, a 1d-array, where the scores inside the 1d-array must be the scores of the **greater label**. In other words, if you have class 0 and 1, then the greater label is `np.argmax(0,1) = 1`. As a consequence, it is important that you should only pass the \"positive class\" which is the \"greater label\" here into the `y_score`. \n\nIn multiclass, there are two cases, either you provide a `labels` argument in, say `labels = [0,2,1]` or `labels = [0,1,2]`, or if you do not provide, then the `y_score` will necessarily be in the order of the numerical\/alphabetical order of the labels in `y_true`. In other words, if `y_true` has 3 unique labels: 0, 1 and 2; then the `y_score` will be a **2d-array** in the form of `y_score = [[0.2, 0.3, 0.5],[...],[...]]` where `y_score[0] = [0.2,0.3,0.5]` must correspond to class 1, 2 and 3 respectively, unless otherwise stated in `labels`.\n\n\n### First Interpretation\n\nNow ROC curve is a TPR vs FPR graph, and the AUC is the area under the curve literally. To find the ROC-AUC, we need to plot many different pairs of points on the graph, and compute the area under it.\n\nAs we can see from the above naive and simple example, there are a total of 6 pairs of points to plot. Those are from `fpr`, `tpr` respectively --> Allow me to further explain with this example where 1 is the positive class:\n\n    y_true_1 = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1]\n    y_preds_1 = [0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5,0.6,0.7,0.8]\n\n1. We need to initialize the thresholds with a large number usually - usually `roc_curve` is written so that ROC point corresponding to the highest threshold `(fpr[0], tpr[0])` is always `(0, 0)`. If this is not the case, a new threshold is created with an arbitrary value of `max(y_score)+1`. Therefore, in this case, we get 1.8 as the first threshold. This large number will ensure the `fpr, tpr` starts at (0,0).\n\n2. Next, when the threshold is $T=0.8$, then one can see that `y_preds_1` has 1 predictions 1, so `y_preds_1=[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]` and hence we can calculate the FPR and TPR: FPR will be 0 because no negative samples 0 are misclassified as 1 in our prediction. TPR will be 0.25 because by definition TPR=TP\/TP+FN = 1\/1+3=0.25 by definition. Therefore `(fpr, tpr) = (0,0.25)`\n\n3. $T=0.7 \\rightarrow$ `y_preds_1 = [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1]`, same logic, FPR will be 0 cause no negative samples 0 are classified as 1 by our classifier! But TPR will be 0.5 because TPR = TP\/TP+FN = 2\/2+2 = 0.5. Therefore `(fpr, tpr) = (0,0.5)`\n\n4. We continue this way until we exhaust all thresholds given `[array([1.8, 0.8, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0.1])]`. And we plot on the graph. \n\n5. How then, do we calculate the area under this curve? One can refer to the source code `auc` in `sklearn.metrics.auc` and see that they used **[Trapezoidal Rule](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Trapezoidal_rule)** to solve it.\n\n6. So one have a rough idea, how the `ROC-AUC` area is computed, and one has to bear in mind that the area is calculated over all thresholds (apparently not the case as `sklearn` discretized the thresholds to reduce computing time, so you will not see the full range of thresholds here). \n\n\n","dcb67afa":"### **Summary**\n\n1. AUC is a threshold-free metrics capable of measuring the overall performance of binary classifier.\n2. AUC should be used in binary classification. In multinomial classification, one-to-rest AUC would be an option using the average of each class.\n3. AUC is a good metric when the rank of output probabilities is of interest.\n4. Note that if you have 2 classes, then finding the AUROC of the positive class (class 1) is equivalent to 1 minus the AUROC of the negative class (class 0). This is not true when we deal with PR-curve.\n5. **Although AUC is powerful, it is not a cure-all. AUC is not suitable for heavily imbalanced class distribution and when the goal is to have well-calibrated probabilities.**\n6. Models with maximized AUC treat the weight between positive and negative class equally.\n7. AUROC would be the metric to use if the goal of the model is to perform equally well on both classes. Image classification between cats & dogs is a good example because the performance on cats is equally important on dogs. \n\n    AUPRC would be the metric to use if the focus of the model is to identify correctly as many **positive** samples as possible. Take spam detectors for example, the goal is to find all the possible spams. Regular emails are not of interest at all \u2014 they overshadow the number of positives.\n\n    There are no defined rules to select the suitable metrics. It really depends on the data and the application. It is important to think thoroughly about the purpose of the model before jumping into the modeling process.\n\n    One thing to note here is that the PR AUC serves as an alternative metric. If the model doesn\u2019t work after the metric is changed, there are still other remedies to deal with imbalanced data, such as downsampling\/upsampling. We\u2019ll cover it later in future posts.","dc52b105":"#### Cons: Imbalanced\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-danger\">\n<b>Imbalanced Data:<\/b> We examine the case in which the dataset is imbalanced and further assume that the positive class is the minority, (note if you assume positive class is majority, then ROC may perform very well here, so the assumption is that the minority is of the positive class). We assume further that the negative class is 90% and positive class is 10%. Intuitively, in an imbalanced dataset, the model **usually does not have trouble predicting the majority class**, and this suggests that they will often get the negatives correct in this case, leading to a high TN. By looking at the FPR, we notice that $\\frac{FP}{FP + TN}$ suggests that FP will be low and TN will be high simply because of the aforementioned idea that the model will likely get the TN correct, and if TN is high, then the FP is low. Consequently, FPR is high. <p>\n\nThe following [on why AUC can be misleading](https:\/\/stats.stackexchange.com\/questions\/360017\/when-is-an-auc-score-misleadingly-high\/360040#360040)\nOne possible reason you can get high AUROC with what some might consider a mediocre prediction is if you have imbalanced data (in favor of the \"zero\" prediction), high recall, and low precision. That is, you're predicting most of the ones at the higher end of your prediction probabilities, but most of the outcomes at the higher end of your prediction probabilities are still zero. This is because the ROC score still gets most of its \"lift\" at the early part of the plot, i.e., for only a small fraction of the zero-predictions. \n\nFor example, if 5% of the test set are \"ones\" and all of the ones appear in the top 10% of your predictions, then your AUC will be at least 18\/19 because, after 18\/19 of the zeroes are predicted, already 100% of the ones were predicted. Even if the top 5% are all zeroes.\n\nWhether this is a \"bad\" prediction depends on your priorities. If you think that false negatives are terrible and false positives are tolerable, then this prediction is okay. But if it's the opposite, then this prediction is pretty bad.\n<\/div>","8b86b4de":"### Intuition\n\nROC is originally used for Binary Classification only, a natural extension to Multi-Class model is the \nIn multi-class model, we can plot N number of AUC ROC Curves for N number classes using One vs ALL methodology.
