There are many algorithms, tools and libraries to choose from. In this case we are going to build Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict the customer attrition, also known as customer churn, customer turnover, or customer defection. We will use TensorFlow deep learning framework to build our model.\n\nCustomer churn (rate) is the measure of the number of individuals or items moving out of a collective group over a specific period.
