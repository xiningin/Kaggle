In this course, you'll build your SQL skills using **BigQuery**, a web service that lets you apply SQL to huge datasets.\n\nIn this lesson, you'll learn the basics of accessing and examining BigQuery datasets. After you have a handle on these basics, we'll come back to build your SQL skills.\n\n# Your first BigQuery commands\n\nTo use BigQuery, we'll import the Python package below:","973d4044":"# Table schema\n\nThe structure of a table is called its **schema**.  We need to understand a table's schema to effectively pull out the data we want. \n\nIn this example, we'll investigate the `full` table that we fetched above.","de23f464":"Every dataset is just a collection of tables.  You can think of a dataset as a spreadsheet file containing multiple tables, all composed of rows and columns.\n\nWe use the `list_tables()` method to list the tables in the dataset.","f9329a46":"In the next section, you'll explore the contents of this table in more detail.

In order, the information is:\n\n* The **name** of the column\n* The **field type** (or datatype) in the column\n* The **mode** of the column (`'NULLABLE'` means that a column allows NULL values, and is the default)\n* A **description** of the data in that column\n\nThe first field has the SchemaField:\n\n`SchemaField('by', 'string', 'NULLABLE', \"The username of the item's author.\",())`\n\nThis tells us:\n- the field (or column) is called `by`,\n- the data in this field is strings, \n- NULL values are allowed, and\n- it contains the usernames corresponding to each item's author.\n\nWe can use the [`list_rows()`](https:\/\/google-cloud.readthedocs.io\/en\/latest\/bigquery\/generated\/google.cloud.bigquery.client.Client.list_rows.html#google.cloud.bigquery.client.Client.list_rows) method to check just the first five lines of of the `full` table to make sure this is right. (Sometimes databases have outdated descriptions, so it's good to check.)  This returns a BigQuery [`RowIterator`](https:\/\/googleapis.github.io\/google-cloud-python\/latest\/bigquery\/generated\/google.cloud.bigquery.table.RowIterator.html) object that can quickly be converted to a pandas DataFrame with the [`to_dataframe()`](https:\/\/google-cloud.readthedocs.io\/en\/latest\/bigquery\/generated\/google.cloud.bigquery.table.RowIterator.to_dataframe.html) method.","fb3e3e69":"The first step in the workflow is to create a [`Client`](https:\/\/google-cloud.readthedocs.io\/en\/latest\/bigquery\/generated\/google.cloud.bigquery.client.Client.html#google.cloud.bigquery.client.Client) object.  As you'll soon see, this `Client` object will play a central role in retrieving information from BigQuery datasets.","21222e85":"The `list_rows()` method will also let us look at just the information in a specific column.

Once you hit that limit, you'll have to wait for it to reset.**\n\nThe commands you've seen so far won't demand a meaningful fraction of that limit. But some BiqQuery datasets are huge. So, if you already know SQL, wait to run SELECT queries until you've seen how to use your allotment effectively. If you are like most people reading this, you don't know how to write these queries yet, so you don't need to worry about this disclaimer.\n","26eb7728":"We'll work with a dataset of posts on [Hacker News](https:\/\/news.ycombinator.com\/), a website focusing on computer science and cybersecurity news.\n\nIn BigQuery, each dataset is contained in a corresponding project.  In this case, our `hacker_news` dataset is contained in the `bigquery-public-data` project.  To access the dataset, \n- We begin by constructing a reference to the dataset with the [`dataset()`](https:\/\/google-cloud.readthedocs.io\/en\/latest\/bigquery\/generated\/google.cloud.bigquery.client.Client.dataset.html#google.cloud.bigquery.client.Client.dataset) method.  \n- Next, we use the [`get_dataset()`](https:\/\/google-cloud.readthedocs.io\/en\/latest\/bigquery\/generated\/google.cloud.bigquery.client.Client.get_dataset.html#google.cloud.bigquery.client.Client.get_dataset) method, along with the reference we just constructed, to fetch the dataset.","cd2150c2":"---\n\n\n\n\n*Have questions or comments?
