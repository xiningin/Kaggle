","57423d5e":"Conversely, Service Level (SLA) and Average Speed of Answer (ASA) have an inverse relationship.  The below chart illustrates that as call volume increases, SLA decreases and ASA goes up.  In conjunction with the above graph, this clearly illustrates how these interact with high abandnment. ","fa58349a":"Beyon the above, since the nulls and incorrect formatting has been corrected, I can now run a heatmap\/correlogram using to determine more meaningful relationships between the various data fields.  ","62f9c723":"In order to review the correlation between all fields, some data needs to be manipulated.  There are several fields that are objects, and these need to be converted into numeric data (float) in order to determine how they relate to other fields in the dataframe. ","88cb4268":"Since there are no null\/nan values within the dataset, visualization of the data below starts with a high-level view of the various fields as a histogram.  This is helpful to determine where incoming call volume is going, and how the various fields are grouped (in terms of aggregate volume). ","500d677c":"Fortunately, the vast majority of incoming calls are above 60% SLA.  At a 60% SLA, the average call is answered in less than 1 minute.  Combining the data from the below and above graphs, this means virtually no calls are being abandoned at a 60% SLA, although ancillary impacts (i.e. customer experience) may be impacted although the call is not abandoned. \n\nLimitations of this dataset prevent a complete analysis of the impact of staffing and relationships with abandonment, volume, etc.  But based on findings, next steps would be to dig further (with an expanded data set) to determine root cause of calls falling beneath the 60% threshold, and determining acceptable business KPI's for this metric (SLA) to balance customer experience, staffing, and cost. ","224f4e1a":"To complete the cleaning of the data, the '%' sign needs to be remove from both the Answer Rate and Service Level (20 Seconds) fields.  This is preventing the conversion of these fields from object (above) to a float (below). ","ffdb9e5b":"The below helps to clearly indicate that wait time, rather than call volume, is a key driver in abandonment in calls.   While there is a relationship between these fields generally, overall, if there are a lot of calls answered quickly, there is less of an impact on abandonment.  Additionally, there is a significant increase in abandonment when wait time exceeds 15 minutes and call volume exceeds 800 calls.
