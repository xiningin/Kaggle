Modi is also helping to increase manufacturing activities in India.\n    * For any country to improve the standard of living of its people, it requires good quality infrastructure.

The CEO has initiated a project wherein the NITI Aayog will provide top-level recommendations to the Chief Ministers (CMs) of various states, which will help them prioritise areas of development for their respective states. Since different states are in different phases of development, the recommendations should be specific to the states.\n\nThe overall goal of this project is to help the CMs focus on areas that will foster economic development for their respective states. Since the most common measure of economic development is the GDP, we will analyse the GDP of the various states of India and suggest ways to improve it.\n\n## Understanding GDP\n\nGross domestic product (GDP) at current prices is the GDP at the market value of goods and services produced in a country during a year. In other words, GDP measures the 'monetary value of final goods and services produced by a country\/state in a given period of time'.\n\nGDP can be broadly divided into goods and services produced by three sectors: the primary sector (agriculture), the secondary sector (industry), and the tertiary sector (services).\n\nIt is also known as nominal GDP. More technically, (real) GDP takes into account the price change that may have occurred due to inflation. This means that the real GDP is nominal GDP adjusted for inflation. We will use the nominal GDP for this exercise. Also, we will consider the financial year 2015-16 as the base year, as most of the data required for this exercise is available for the aforementioned period.\n\n## Per Capita GDP and Income\n\nTotal GDP divided by the population gives the per capita GDP, which roughly measures the average value of goods and services produced per person. The per capita income is closely related to the per capita GDP (though they are not the same). In general, the per capita income increases when the per capita GDP increases, and vice-versa. For instance, in the financial year 2015-16, the per capita income of India was \u20b993,293, whereas the per capita GDP of India was $1717, which roughly amounts to \u20b91,11,605. \n\n## Data\n\nThe data is sourced from https:\/\/data.gov.in\/, an Open Government Data (OGD) platform of India. The data for GDP analysis of the Indian states is divided into two parts:\n\nData I-A: This dataset consists of the GSDP (Gross State Domestic Product) data for the states and union territories.\n\nData I-B: This dataset contains the distribution of GSDP among three sectors: the primary sector (agriculture), the secondary sector (industry) and the tertiary sector (services) along with taxes and subsidies. There is separate dataset for each of the states. \n\n\nThere are two parts to this project. In the first part, we analyse and compare the GDPs of various Indian states (both total and per capita). The GDP of a state is referred to as the GSDP (Gross State Domestic Product). Then, we divide the states into four categories based on the GDP per capita, and for each of these four categories, analyse the sectors that contribute the most to the GDP (such as agriculture, real estate, manufacturing, etc.).\n\nIn the second part, we analyse whether GDP per capita is related to dropout rates in schools and colleges.\n\n\nNote: We filtered out the union territories (Delhi, Chandigarh, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, etc.) for further analysis, as they are governed directly by the centre, not state governments.","33535c56":"#### C1 States:\n1. We can see that for C1 states subsectors like Real Estate, Agriculture, Trade and Hotels, Manufacturing contribute evenly with very high contribution for each category which leads to the overall increase in the GDP for C1 States.\n2. Construction also contributes substantially to the total GDP for C1 states as these states have rapid urbanization taking place which leads to increase in overall GDP.","1b275086":"# Part-II: GDP and Education Dropout Rates"}}
