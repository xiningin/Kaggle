the brutal death of Geroge Floyd under Police custody we wanted to discover the data of all fatal police shootings in US and try to uncover the numbers and reasoning behind these Fatal Police Shootings.\n\n* This notebook provides a basic overview of the fatal police shootings in the US\n* The analysis in this notebook is mainly done through Visual representation of the data\n* We have tried to uncover the reasons behind these fatal shootings in brief\n\nNote : My team member ( Ankita Dube - https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/ankita-dube-a127981a5\/) and me with our mentor + friend Rocky Jagtiani (https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/rockystats) have created many such notebooks as part of the coursework under \"Masters in Data Science Program\" at Suven (https:\/\/datascience.suvenconsultants.com) & have done internships too.\n","6c895315":"# Conclusion\n\n1. The Piechart shows that majority of the fatal shootings have occured against people of white ethnicity with number standing at 51.3% which is followed by people of African American ethnicity at 26.4% which is then followed by people of Hispanic ethnicity at 18.1%.\n\n*  The White Population stands at 83.15% and are part of 51.3% of fatal shootings.\n\n*  The African American Population stands at 6.82% and are part of 26.4% of fatal shootings.\n\n*  The Hispanic Population stands at 9.3% and are part of 18.1% of fatal shootings\n\n2. An overwhelming majority of the people involved in these Fatal shootings are Male\n\n3. In a major chunk of these Fatal Shootings the Police did not have a body camera on them to record the situation\n\n4. Most of the people involved in these Fatal Shootings were not Fleeing\n\n\n# Vote of thanks\n\nI would like to humbly and sincerely thank my mentor Rocky Jagtiani((https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/rocky-jagtiani-3b390649) .He is more of a friend to me than mentor. The Python for Data Science taught by him and various assignments we did and are still doing is the best way to learn and skill in Data Science field. See https:\/\/datascience.suvenconsultants.com once for more","dd9a4cbb":"From the above four diagrams we can infer the following\n\n1. Mississippi(MS) has the highest poverty rate in US and the second lowest graduation rate but it does not feature in the top 20 states with the highest fatal shootings.\n\n2. Texas has the lowest graduation rate in the US and ranks 15th out of the 51 states in terms of the poverty rate.Texas has the second highest fatal shootings in the US.\n\n3. California is classified as the most dangerous state and the city of Los Angeles which belongs to California is the most dangerous city.California state ranks 22nd out of the 51 states in poverty rate and 11th out of 51 in the graduation rate.\n\n# Hence Poverty rate and Graduation rate do not have a standalone impact on the fatal shootings."}}
