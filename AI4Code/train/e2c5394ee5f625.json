I note for example, that not only are temperatures observed at 0.1m, but also at 0.6 and 1.1m above the floor. Similarly, both metric and imperial units will be used.\n\nAs such, I will default to using only metric (degrees C) measurements. Similarly, I will default to using the SET (standard effective temperature) unless a true temperature observation is required. In such a case, observations taken at 1.1m above the floor will be used, since this approximates the centre of a human's core.","740231c7":"# How do human and personal factors influence thermal comfort perception?\n*Do age, sex, metabolism, and other human factors influence how you feel comfort?*\n\n","45ac0bbb":"# Basic Stats\n\nLet's start by just looking at the basics.","e43ab5b3":"Whilst not particularly useful, this does provide some helpful data for our ranges.

Similarly, our humidity IQR is from 59.4 to 35.3 % and outdoor air temperature from 25 C to 10 C.\n\nThese do provide something of a rough framework for where we could expect our numbers to be. They would suggest that the majority of our measurements are taken in temperature to tropoical regions, though with a few extreme values (e.g. outdoor temperature -18.4).\n\nIt's also worth noting the mean age of 32, suggesting that our data skews towards young-mid working age subjects.","becb2e3b":"# Data Import","6cf5f644":"This data suggests that the data available is quite unevenly spread out between cities.

There have even been popular news outlets who have covered stories on sexism in office temperatures from the New York Times, the New Yorker, and Time Magazine. The question related to this task is to piece together evidence from the ASHRAE Thermal Comfort Database II to show how factors such as sex, age, metabolism, and other factors influence comfort.\n> \n> **Expected Submission**\n> Users who want to tackle this task should use the Kaggle Kernels to piece together data and evidence gathered from the data set that provide a foundation for their analysis. The analysis should include a lot of documentation to provide clarity of the techniques and approach used.\n> \n> **Relevant Literature**\n> A great overview of recent work to analyze these differences can be found in this recent publication: https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/324809583_Individual_Difference_in_Thermal_Comfort_A_Literature_Review","a77378b2":"# The Data - As Provided\nAlongside the data, the following information has been provided:\n\n> Dataset Source: https:\/\/datadryad.org\/stash\/dataset\/doi:10.6078\/D1F671\n> \n> **Abstract**\n> Recognizing the value of open-source research databases in advancing the art and science of\n> HVAC, in 2014 the ASHRAE Global Thermal Comfort Database II project was launched under\n> the leadership of University of California at Berkeley\u2019s Center for the Built Environment and\n> The University of Sydney\u2019s Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) Laboratory.\n> The exercise began with a systematic collection and harmonization of raw data from the last\n> two decades of thermal comfort field studies around the world.

For example, when examining Sex or Age, we will need to ensure that we maintain a constant proportion of say, Building Type & subjects from each city\/country.\n\nThe most obvious strategy to do this, would be to use a combination of normalisation, binning and weighting techniques to create a standard representative \"breadbasket\".\n\nOn a personal note, I am a data analyst with a physics background - my domain knowlege is somewhat limited. Although I will endevour to do background reading, I will focus my efforts on what information can be derrived from statistics, rather than modeling of bioloigical systems etc. ","42004219":"It's a good thing that we have so many entries - we'll probably need to subset quite significantly - otherwise we might accidently capture trends in time or city.\n\nGiven how many publications, we'll also need to see how consistant they are - or if they have any biases.","788925ff":"As you can see, there's a lot of NaN data in our system - something we'll need to take into account when performing our analysis. \n\nWe have some 107,585 entrys - so it's quite a large and impressive dataset!"}}
