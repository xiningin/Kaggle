But this is obviously a rule that was tailor made to Mr Harris, and is equivalent to simply saying \"Mr Harris did not survive\", a rule that cannot be generalized to new unseen passengers who are not Mr Harris.","87c1aac0":"Now, similarly, let's see what is the % of men and women who survived, and then by the same token with class and age:","de624e74":"The accuracy function compares between the actual results (our ground truth - y_train or y_test) with the prediction of the model (given by \"classifier.predict(X_train)\" or \"classifier.predict(X_test)\" respectrively.","600dc42a":"# Data Pre-processing\n## Non numeric features\n\nWe are going to use a decision tree model.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - understanding the data and the underlying interactions between the different variables\n2. Data Pre-processing - preparing the data for modelling\n3. Building the model\n4. Evaluating the performance of the model, and possibly fine-tune and tweak it if necessary\n\nThe goal of the model is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster, given their age, class and a few other features.\n\nAlmost every line of code would be explained, so those who are more familiar with python (and especially with the numpy and pandas libraries) are welcome to skip the first parts","0b993e8c":"As we can see, at least in terms of survival statistics, the \"Titanic\" movie (spoiler alert) was an accurate representation of reality","73b3b71d":"# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n\nAfter loading the data, let us examine it.

During the training, the algorithm is trying to build the optimal decision tree. The way it works is very similar to the game \"21 Questions\". In the game we always start with general questions that give the best partition of the data (\"is the character you are thinking of a male? are them alive?\" etc.).
