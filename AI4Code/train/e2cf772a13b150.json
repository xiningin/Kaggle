Ho ! Ho\nSanta has exciting news! For 100 days before Christmas, he opened up tours to his workshop.

We observed an increasing trend (increasing as the X axis show the number of days from Christmas eve i.e. Dec 24th) in the number of families to prefer to dates close to Christmas. \n\nLets construct a timeseries by converting the choices to dates. We will plot a line graph to get a better understanding of the trend.","02cfad22":"# About the data\nEach family has listed their top 10 preferences for the dates they'd like to attend Santa's workshop tour. Dates are integer values representing the days before Christmas, e.g., the value 1 represents Dec 24, the value 2 represents Dec 23, etc. Each family also has a number of people attending, n_people.\n\n"}}
