The country is composed of four provinces and one federal territory: the provinces of Balochistan, Punjab, Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and the federally-administered Islamabad Capital Territory. Additionally, Pakistan also administers two autonomous territories in the disputed region of Kashmir: Gilgit\u2212Baltistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nDue to the ongoing Kashmir dispute with neighbouring India, it also claims sovereignty over the union territories of Ladakh and Jammu and Kashmir, but has not exercised administrative authority over either region since its independence and subsequent war with India in 1947\u20131948. All of Pakistan's provinces and territories are subdivided into divisions, which are further subdivided into districts, and then tehsils, which are again further subdivided into union councils.\n\nhttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Administrative_units_of_Pakistan","62d26814":"![](https:\/\/qph.fs.quoracdn.net\/main-qimg-0136017c1bb699e5bafb8ce7e9484352)quora.com"}}
