According to WHO, this is the 14th worldwide pandemic and due to the nature of how global the world is today, this pandemic has been the most spread out in terms of infections with almost the entire world suffering. The pandemic has brought about huge economic worries for nations and even more so for the daily wage workers who are without any work now and need to depend upon goverment subsidies. As the world has globalised further in today's times more than ever, the virus has successfully spread in all the habitable continents worlwide. \n\nThe pandemic as brought about unprecedented problems for working class as well as the middle class people who have sadly lost their livelihoods as well due to the accompanied global recession occuring as a result of multiple lockdowns in many countries. COVID-19 (SARS Cov-2) is a virus that targets the respiratory tract of vulnerable patients. According to WHO, this is the 14th worldwide pandemic and due to the nature of how global the world is today, this pandemic has been the most spread out in terms of infections with almost the entire world suffering. The pandemic has brought about huge economic worries for nations and even more so for the daily wage workers who are without any work now and need to depend upon goverment subsidies.\n\nWith respect to the nature of virus, it keeps cosntantly mutating hence, making the job of the virologists extremely challenging to come up with a virus. This ailment has also brough about a great deal of an opportunity for budding data sceince emthisiasts such as myself to understand how the virus has spread in India. Through this kernel, I would like to find a few insights such. \n\n![Mar20_01_Wikimedia3.jpg](attachment:Mar20_01_Wikimedia3.jpg)\n\n# Importing relevant libraries and dataset","5c74b132":"As we can see, there are no missing values in the dataframe.

This is an encouraging statistic as it means people are safely recovering without much issues. As of today, the total recovered cases have touched nearly 5 million (or 50 lakhs). \n\n## e) Death rate\n\nLet us check the rate of increase in death rate as a result of the virus.
