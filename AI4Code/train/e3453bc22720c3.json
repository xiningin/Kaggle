Individual circles beyond *that* are outliers.\n\nThis boxplot shows us that although all five wines recieve broadly similar ratings, Bordeaux-style wines tend to be rated a little higher than a Chardonnay.\n\nBoxplots are great for summarizing the shape of many datasets. They also don't have a limit in terms of numeracy: you can place as many boxes in the plot as you feel comfortable squeezing onto the page.\n\nHowever, they only work for interval variables and nominal variables with a large number of possible values; they assume your data is roughly normally distributed (otherwise their design doesn't make much sense); and they don't carry any information about individual values, only treating the distribution as a whole.\n\nI find the slightly more advanced `violinplot` to be more visually enticing, in most cases:","755a8b66":"This data is in a \"record-oriented\" format. Each individual row is a single record (a review); in aggregate, the list of all rows is the list of all records (all reviews). This is the format of choice for the most kinds of data: data corresponding with individual, unit-identifiable \"things\" (\"records\"). The majority of the simple data that gets generated is created in this format, and data that isn't can almost always be converted over. This is known as a \"tidy data\" format.\n\n`seaborn` is designed to work with this kind of data out-of-the-box, for all of its plot types, with minimal fuss. This makes it an incredibly convenient workbench tool.\n\n`pandas` is not designed this way. In `pandas`, every plot we generate is tied very directly to the input data. In essence, **`pandas` expects your data being in exactly the right *output* shape, regardless of what the input is.**\n\n<!--\nIn the previous section of this tutorial, we purposely evaded this issue by using supplemental datasets in a \"just right\" shape. Starting from the data that we already have, here's what it would take to generate a simple histogram:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\ntop_five_wines_scores = (\n    reviews\n        .loc[np.where(reviews.variety.isin(reviews.variety.value_counts().head(5).index))]\n        .loc[:, ['variety', 'points']]\n        .groupby('variety')\n        .apply(lambda df: pd.Series(df.points.values))\n        .unstack()\n        .T\n)\ntop_five_wines_scores.plot.hist()\n```\n\nAs we demonstrated above, to do the same thing in `seaborn`, all we need is:\n\n```python\nsns.distplot(reviews.points, bins=10, kde=False)\n```\n\nThe difference is stark!\n-->\n\nHence, in practice, despite its simplicity, the `pandas` plotting tools are great for the initial stages of exploratory data analytics, but `seaborn` really becomes your tool of choice once you start doing more sophisticated explorations.\n\n<!--\nMy recommendations are:\n* Bar plot: \n  * `pd.Series.plot.bar`\n  * `sns.countplot`\n* Scatter plot:\n  * `pd.Series.plot.scatter`\n  * `sns.jointplot`\n* Hex plot:\n  * `pd.Series.plot.hex`\n  * `sns.jointplot`\n* Line\/KDE plot:\n  * `pd.Series.plot.line` for nominal categorical variables\n  * `sns.kdeplot` for interval variables\n* Box\/Violin plot:\n  * `sns.boxplot`\n  * `sns.violinplot`\n* Histogram:\n   * `sns.distplot`\n-->","e381654b":"# Plotting with seaborn\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/3cYy56H.png\" width=\"350px\"\/><\/td>\n<td><img src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/V9jAreo.png\" width=\"350px\"\/><\/td>\n<td><img src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/5a6dwtm.png\" width=\"350px\"\/><\/td>\n<td><img src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ZSsHzrA.png\" width=\"350px\"\/><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"font-weight:bold; font-size:16px;\">Count (Bar) Plot<\/td>\n<td style=\"font-weight:bold; font-size:16px;\">KDE Plot<\/td>\n<td style=\"font-weight:bold; font-size:16px;\">Joint (Hex) Plot<\/td>\n<td style=\"font-weight:bold; font-size:16px;\">Violin Plot<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>sns.countplot()<\/td>\n<td>sns.kdeplot()<\/td>\n<td>sns.jointplot()<\/td>\n<td>sns.violinplot()<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Good for nominal and small ordinal categorical data.<\/td>\n<td>Good for interval data.<\/td>\n<td>Good for interval and some nominal categorical data.<\/td>\n<td>Good for interval data and some nominal categorical data.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n\n----\n\nIn the previous two sections we explored data visualization using the `pandas` built-in plotting tools. In this section, we'll do the same with `seaborn`.\n\n`seaborn` is a standalone data visualization package that provides many extremely valuable data visualizations in a single package. It is generally a much more powerful tool than `pandas`; let's see why.","f6f4ca7b":"A KDE plot is better than a line chart for getting the \"true shape\" of interval data. In fact, I recommend always using it instead of a line chart for such data.\n\nHowever, it's a worse choice for ordinal categorical data. A KDE plot expects that if there are 200 wine rated 85 and 400 rated 86, then the values in between, like 85.5, should smooth out to somewhere in between (say, 300). However, if the value in between can't occur (wine ratings of 85.5 are not allowed), then the KDE plot is fitting to something that doesn't exist. In these cases, use a line chart instead.\n\nKDE plots can also be used in two dimensions.","2fd35e55":"KDE, short for \"kernel density estimate\", is a statistical technique for smoothing out data noise. It addresses an important fundamental weakness of a line chart: it will buff out outlier or \"in-betweener\" values which would cause a line chart to suddenly dip.\n\nFor example, suppose that there was just one wine priced 19.93\\$, but several hundred prices 20.00\\$. If we were to plot the value counts in a line chart, our line would dip very suddenly down to 1 and then back up to around 1000 again, creating a strangely \"jagged\" line. The line chart with the same data, shown below for the purposes of comparison, has exactly this problem!\n\nNote that the x axis in a `seaborn` `kdeplot` is the variable being plotted (in this case, `price`), while the y axis is how often it occurs. ","fa573c40":"Bivariate KDE plots like this one are a great alternative to scatter plots and hex plots. They solve the same data overplotting issue that scatter plots suffer from and hex plots address, in a different but similarly visually appealing. However, note that bivariate KDE plots are very computationally intensive. We took a sample of 5000 points in this example to keep compute time reasonable.","2bf63166":"## Boxplot and violin plot\n\n`seaborn` provides a boxplot function. It creates a statistically useful plot that looks like this:","be941328":"To plot two variables against one another in `seaborn`, we use `jointplot`.","503c0059":"## Distplot\n\nThe `seaborn` equivalent to a `pandas` histogram is the `distplot`. Here's an example:","09cd5a1e":"## Countplot\n\nThe `pandas` bar chart becomes a `seaborn` `countplot`.","afefd019":"A `violinplot` cleverly replaces the box in the boxplot with a kernel density estimate for the data.
