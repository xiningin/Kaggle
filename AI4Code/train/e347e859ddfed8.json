Additionally, I do believe this accuracy would be improved after having a full grasp of the domain of data to use in the improved model. ","ed58c8ff":"From the above, we can easily see that Random Forest Classifier is the model with the highest accuracy, thus it is the one we are going to use.","ff665021":"Having an accuracy of 86% means that our model is good enough to predict new data","78fda295":"**a. Working with categorical features (Features with non-numerical datatypes)**\n\nWe'll be analyzing the likeability of encoding values in these features by checking their unique characters (we'll automatically drop the feature if it has more than 3 meaningful unique characters for better accuracy).","09e4065e":"**b. Working with numerical features**\n\nWe'll be analyzing the correlation between these features and the target","a66d5e75":"From the above cell, we conclude that there are no missing values in our dataset (since all features have 10000 non-null values). \n\nHowever we can identify some features which have non-numerical data (usually represented as objects) and we'll need to delete them or encode them into numbers (**Because computers don't understand texts thus we transfer them into encoded numbers**). Those features are:\n1. Surname\n2. Geography\n3. Gender","2f1ede32":"## **Introduction**\n\nCustomer churn is a term used to refer to customers who leave the financial institution they've been working with. It has emerged as one of the major problems for financial institutions including banks ([ukessays, 2016](http:\/\/www.ukessays.com\/essays\/marketing\/customer-churn-management-in-banking-and-finance-marketing-essay.php)).\n\nThe following program codes contain three phases including:\n\n        1. Analyzing data and feature engineering\n\n        2. Building a Machine Learning Mode\n\n        3. Building a Demo-API detecting Bank Churn from user inputs\n      \n\n\n**Key terms used in the codes**\n1. Model: A machine learning term used to represent an algorithm that learns from the data and make predictions\n1. Features : Usually known as columns\n2. Observations: Usually known as rows\n3. Label or Target: A column which is being predicted\n4. Outlier: A value situated away form the mean \n4. Feature engineering: Checking the correlation between features and the target and removing features which doesn't support the accuracy of our model.","618935a0":"### 3. Feature Engineering","7bb4d5f5":"From the table above, we can easily detect the following trends:\n1. Many females have exited the bank than males in all regions represented in the Dataset\n2. Germany is the country with many bank churns\n\nHowever, though these features (Geography and Gender) might correlate with the target column, it is better to drop them from our model to preserve the universality of our prediction model (not only predicting values from Germany, France and Spain).","e1b929e5":"Some features such as RowNumber and CustomerId contain personal informations which doesn't affect our model, thus they should also be removed from the dataset","0b880d4a":"## 1.

All features have a weak or strong correlation with the target (Thus we are considering all of them for our model)\n1. Age, Balance, NumOfProducts, IsActiveMember, CreditScore are the features with significant correlation.","6c0705c6":"## Overview on the Dataset\n\n1. The dataset is a labelled dataset (has features determining the target) thus we'll use **Supervised Learning models**\n2.
