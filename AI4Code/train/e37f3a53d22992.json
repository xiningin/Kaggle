As CNNs are translational but not rotational invariant, it's a good idea to add flips during training. This way we increase the variety of our data in a meaningful way as each patch could be rotated as well on the tissue slice.

Even then we still obtain a accuracy score higher than 0.5 and we have no further insights. \n\n\n### The f1-score\n\nA better choice is the f1-score that is defined as the harmonic mean of precision and recall:\n\n$$ f_{1} = \\frac{2}{\\frac{1}{recall} + \\frac{1}{precision}} $$\n\nIn contrast to the arithmetic mean it is shifted towards small outiers but not influenced strongly by large ones. Hence if either the recall or the precision is small, the f1-score will then tend towards the smaller value. Let's pick an example with $recall=0.1$ and $precision=0.6$:\n\n$$ f_{1} = \\frac{2}{\\frac{1}{0.1} + \\frac{1}{0.6}} = \\frac{2}{\\frac{10}{1} + \\frac{10}{6}} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 6}{70} = \\frac{12}{70} = 0.1714$$\n\nYou can see that the $f1-score=0.1714$ is then shifted towards the smaller value of the recall and not close to the arithmetic mean of $\\mu=0.35$.\n\n### Precision and recall\n\nTo fully understand the f1-score we first need to grasp precision and recall. :-) To be honest... I always have to look it up:\n\n$$ recall = \\frac{TruePositives}{TruePositives + FalsePositives} $$\n\nImagine our model would predict \"cancer\" all the time. Then we would have the maximum number of true positives but also a very high number of false positives that decreases the recall to some baseline value. In contrast if our model would always predict \"no cancer\" we would have no true positives and our recall equals zero. For this reason one can say that the recall answers: **\"How many selected cases are positive?\"**\n\n$$ precision = \\frac{TruePositives}{TruePositives + FalseNegatives} $$\n\n**How many positive cases are selected?**","06d347f7":"### Visualising the breast tissue images <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"tissueimages\"><\/a>\n\nOk, now it's time to go one step deeper with our EDA.

It's malicious and able to form metastases which makes it especially dangerous. Often a biopsy is done to remove small tissue samples. Then a pathologist has to decide whether a patient has IDC, another type of breast cancer or is healthy. In addition sick cells need to be located to find out how advanced the disease is and which grade should be assigned. This has to be done manually and is a time consuming process. Furthermore the decision depends on the expertise of the pathologist and his or her equipment. Therefor deep learning could be of great help to automatically detect and locate tumor tissue cells and to speed up the process. In order to exploit the full potential one could build a pipeline using massive amounts of tissue image data of various hospitals that were evaluated by different experts. This way one would be able to overcome the dependence on the pathologist which would be especially useful in regions where no experts are available .      \n\n## Our goal\n\nAs we started with this analysis we asked ourselves if we would be able to improve the results that were presented 2014 in the paper [Automatic detection of invasive ductal carcinoma in whole slide images with Convolutional Neural Networks](http:\/\/citeseerx.ist.psu.edu\/viewdoc\/download?doi=10.1.1.725.4294&rep=rep1&type=pdf) of professor [Anant Madabhushi](https:\/\/case.edu\/medicine\/ccir\/faculty\/anant-madabhushi) and his group. Many years have passed by since then and it's very likely that all methods used in the paper have already been changed, improved and that new research has already been done. Nonetheless it's a very good exercise to practice or develop own deep learning and data science skills.\n\n\n## Methods presented in the paper\n\nCollecting information... ;-)\n\n* In the paper tissue slices of 162 patients were used all having IDC (113 used for training and 49 for validation)\n* One pathologist was used to determine regions of IDC given a tissue slice \n* evaluation metric: F1 score and balanced accuracy\n\n\n* Our goal: Given a patient and a patch of a tissue slice predict wheather it contains IDC or not.\n    * 3 possibilities: healthy tissue, IDC, another subtype of breast cancer\n* business case: prediction so far is done manually by pathologists and varies from expert to expert. The goal is to assist with an automatic detection of tumors (not expert dependent). \n\n\n## Table of contents\n\n1. [What is meant by invasive ductal carcinoma?](#intro) \n2.
