There were already underlying ethnic tensions, but the riots were sparked by the jury acquittal of the 4 officers responsible for usage of excessive force in the beating and arrest of Rodney King.  Ultimately the riots resulted in 63 deaths, thousands of injuries, and $1 billion in damages.  In this dataset, we have information on the 63 deaths that occurred in relation the LA Riots.

Now let's find their coordinates so that we can plot them on the map as well."}}
