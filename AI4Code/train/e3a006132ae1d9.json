The earliest record of phrenic stimulation for the treatment of asphyxia was reported in 1783. In the mid-1850s, French neurologists also proposed such an idea, but it was Hugo Wilhelm von Ziemssen who performed the first diaphragmatic pacing on a young female patient who had asphyxiated on charcoal vapor.\" \n\n\"The true beginnings of diaphragmatic pacing started in the 1860s and 70s. The father of modern diaphragm pacing is Dr William W L Glenn from Yale University, who showed that the technique was not only practical but could be used clinically for the treatment for several medical disorders. With advances in technology, more refined and flexible electrodes were developed, and the thoracoscopic method of implantation became practical.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/emedicine.medscape.com\/article\/1970348-overview#a4","e5242d2f":"<h1 style=\"background-color:#DC143C; font-family:'Brush Script MT',cursive;color:white;font-size:200%; text-align:center;border-radius: 50% 20% \/ 10% 40%\">Diaphragm pacing system implanted in a patient with ALS<\/h1>\n\nCitation: Kotan D, Kaymak K, G\u00fcndogdu AA.

This procedure is gaining in popularity, and the number of centers implanting diaphragm pacing systems (DPS) is increasing. DPS delays the need for a ventilation machine in the early stages of Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) disease. In this case study, we present a young female ALS patient. A DPS was implanted after respiratory insufficiency began. In the one-year follow-up period following her operation, her need for ventilatory support disappeared.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/26444327\/","9ed1fa92":"<h1 style=\"background-color:#DC143C; font-family:'Brush Script MT',cursive;color:white;font-size:200%; text-align:center;border-radius: 50% 20% \/ 10% 40%\">Safety and efficacy of diaphragm pacing in patients with respiratory insufficiency due to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (DiPALS): a multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial<\/h1>\n\nAuthors: DiPALS Writing Committee on behalf of the DiPALS Study Group Collaborators\n\n\"Survival was shorter in the non-invasive ventilation plus pacing group than in the non-invasive ventilation alone group (median 11\u00b70 months vs 22\u00b75 months; adjusted hazard ratio 2\u00b727, 95% CI 1\u00b722\u20134\u00b725; p=0\u00b7009). 28 (76%) patients died in the pacing group and 19 (51%) patients died in the non-invasive ventilation alone group.
