I would like to know if there is a dependence between batting 1st or fielding 1st and their wins or losses.\n\nChi-square test is a type of hypothesis testing done to identify the association between two categorical or nominal variables.\n\nHere I chose to perform the Chi-square test of independence between two categorical variable to see if there is any association between CSK's 1st batting or fielding and their wins.","ac371fe2":"We formulate the null and alternate hypotheses as below,\n\n\nH0: The result of the match is independent on 1st batting or fielding\n\nHa: The result of the match is dependent on 1st batting or fielding\n\nWe chose the 5% significance level for our analysis i.e., \u03b1 = 0.05. Each non-parametric test has its own specific assumptions. The assumptions of the Chi-square are as below\n\n* The data in the cells should be frequencies, or counts of cases rather than percentages or some other transformation of the data.\n* The categorical variables that are being tested are mutually exclusive.\n* There are 2 variables, and both are measured as categories, usually at the nominal level.\n* The value of the cell expecteds should be 5 or more in at least 80% of the cells, and no cell should have an expected of less than one.\n\nOur data is in accordance with this assumptions.","4087c0d6":"The p-value we get from the chi square test is 0.29228546548845175, which is greater than our significance level of 0.05. Therefore, we do not reject the null hypothesis. We conclude that there is not enough evidence to suggest an association between 1st batting or fielding and the result of the match.\n\nBased on the results, we can state the following:\n\nThere is no association between 1st batting or fielding and the result of the match. Thus CSK's win does not depend on whether they bat first or field first."}}
