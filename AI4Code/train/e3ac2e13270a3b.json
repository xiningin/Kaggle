Brake up your text with the usage of headings. You can use **bolding** or *italics* for emphazise text. Also using color can help you. \n\nAnd finally let's talk about emojis. Personally, I am on the fence with emojis. I would say, to avoid emojis if you can. However, from time to time I like to use them as well.\ud83e\udd86 So, this is my rough rule: **Try to avoid emojis. If you cannot resist the urge, try to reduce the amount of emojis by half once you are done.**","1ea00a6d":"\ud83d\ude80 Let's put everything we have learned together in a [final analytics report](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/iamleonie\/data-journalism-visualization-storytelling-4-5\/)!","a79b2d12":"# Introduction\nThis is part 4 of the [Data Journalism Workflow tutorial  series](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/iamleonie\/data-journalism-workflow).\nIn this notebook you will learn how to create the matching visualization to the message or story we want to convey to our audience.\n\n![Screenshot%202021-03-23%20at%2019.53.11.png](attachment:Screenshot%202021-03-23%20at%2019.53.11.png)","d8f33476":"# Preparation\n\nBefore we get into the details, let's lay some grounwork first.\n\n## Header Image\n\nWhether you want to use a header image is completely up to you and the reports purpose. If you are writing a Kaggle Kernel or a blog post, header images can help you make your content look more put together and catch your readers attention. If you are writing a corporate report or a scientific paper, you may want to avoid a catchy header image and instead opt for your most important visualization or a schema.\n\n## Hide Code Cells\n\nSince our final product is going to be a report or article and not a piece of source code, I recommend you hide your code cells. Of course you want to think about which code cells you would like to show and which you would like to hide. For example, if you are writing a coding tutorial you may want to show specific pieces of code. However, if you have code that visualized data, then you may want to think about if the code cell helps or disturbs the audiences reading flow. If the answer is that the code is distracting, then hide your code by clicking on the icon with the three dots on the top right corner of your cell code and selecting \"Hide input\".\n\n![Screenshot%202021-03-19%20at%2023.20.58.png](attachment:Screenshot%202021-03-19%20at%2023.20.58.png)\n\n\n## Color Palette\nAnother aspekt that is going to make your report look more put together is to set on a specific color palette. If you work in an organization you might already have a corporate identity color palette. Otherwise choose some specific colors. Chosing a color palette is probably a topic on its own. I will keep it short here but if you want to get deeper into this topic, I recommend you research the topic \"color theory\". \n\nAlso, if you are interested in this topic, I recommend you read up on color blindness. **Red\u2013green blindness affects 8% of males and 0.5% of females**. This is especially important if you want to convince someone of your idea. You may want to keep this information in the back of your mind and adjust the colors according to your audience. Otherwise, your visualization may be difficult to understand and therefore, you might not achieve want you set out to do.\n\nHere let's just settle for three main colors:\n- dominat color\n- secondary color\n- accent color\n\nIf you are a desginer, I hope you are not cringing at my color choices. I will pick the following: Netflix red as dominat color, dark grey as secondary color and a light yellow (popcorn theme) as an accent color. ","b764a466":"# Work in progress"}}
