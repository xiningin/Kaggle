Let's begin!","6b8b9e14":"All the steps described until now will be inserted in a Scikit's Pipeline! It's a functionality that allow us to define a sequence of transformation and modeling steps as a class that can be used in different datasets when, for example, our model is running in production.

We will aways use the \"pass_features\" (aka binary features) without any kind of transformation, since it's not strictly necessary. Also, all the features with many different values will be target encoded since we have to avoid the curse of dimentionality and our notebook memory limitations.\n\nThen, we can make three choices:\n* Encode nominal features with few different values and ordinal features with few different values with one hot encoding (we call this \"minimum_te\")\n* Encode just nominal features with low count with one hot encoding and use target encoding in the ordinal features with few different values (\"medium_te\") or\n* Encode all nominal and ordinal features with target encoding (\"maximum_te\" configuration)\n\nWe will test the three possibilities.","938d9ea2":"So, let's take the best $2$ models:","f0939e9e":"Also, notice that the validation set is composed of $10 \\%$ of the training dataset.

The $X \\%$ value in our model is $50 \\%$. It's a smart mechanism that is able to create a robust neural network, that is capable to take reasonable predictions evn without some of its synaptic weights! \n\nThe BatchNormalization layer standardizes the values by learning the variance and the means of previous batch values. It can help us to don't have explosive (positive or negative) values in out Neural Network.\n\nFinally, the EarlyStopping callback will train our Neural Network while the validation score increases.

Final Conclusions\n\nSo, here I can list what I learned with this challenge:\n\n1. We can use different encoding schemes to tranform our categorical features in numbers that can be processed by machine learning models. The best encoding scheme depends not only on the number of different features of the model, but also on the kind of estimator that we will use.\n2. Sometimes, simple models as Logistic Regressions may already give us great results and additional efforts are, sometimes, useless. I mean: would it by really important to improve the score in $0.5 \\%$ after applying a huge effort in a complex neural network? Well, it depends on the kind of business or application.\n3. Wide and Deep neural networks may be seen as an optimal linear combination between a simple logistic regression and a deep neural network. So, it's a mix between a complex model and an optimal one. It was interesting to use it here.\n4. When working with neural networks, we should consider alternative regularization mechanisms such as Dropout layers or BatchNormalization layers to improve the consistency and prediction power of the estimator.\n5. The EarlyStopping is an elegant way to avoid overfitting. But I got better results when I increased the patience from $10$ to $30$. Why? If the convergence of the weights is slow, we can wait more in order to obtain a better estimator.\n6. Blending independent models may help us to reach better results thanks to the Central Limit Theorem :)\n\nIf you read until this point, thanks a lot!

Dimentionality Reduction With Principal Component Analysis\n## 2.1. Linear Transformations\n\nThe principal component analysis is, itself, a Scikit-Learn model. It's basically a simple linear transformation that is applied to out dataset. When I say that I am applying a linear transformation over a vector, I'm saying that I'm multiplying this vector by a matrix:\n\n$$V_{Transformed} = A.V_{Before}$$\n\nWhere $V_{Before}$ is a single vector, with a number of dimentions equal to the number of columns of our original dataframe and we have as many vectors as rows in our dataset.\n\nInitially, we apply a $N \\times N$ matrix over our vectors, where $N$ is the number of columns. It means that we are using all the output dimentions of the vector.\n\n![LinearTransformation](http:\/\/duriansoftware.com\/joe\/media\/gl3-linear-transformation-matrices-01.png)\n\nIf we apply the same linear transformation over different vectors, as we can see in the figure above, the angle between the two vectors will change and some components will be \"stretched\" ou \"shrinked\" as we can see in the figure above.\n\nIn the Principal Component Analysis we don't apply any linear transformation over our dataset. We will change the angle of each pair of vectors to $90$ degrees and obtain independent components (i.e vectors with no mutual projections over each other):\n\n![PCA](https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.sportscidata.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Principal_Component_Analysis_print.png?fit=1024%2C683&ssl=1)\n\n** This transformation is applied over the centered vectors, as we will explain in the next section **","0e95d747":"Creating a model with the same weights with the MonteCarlo parameter equal to \"True\":","4d452162":"We can also blend the models, and consider the average of the neural network output with the best logistic regression we found (model B):","ad71789f":"Preparing a list with all hyperparameters possible combinations:","fc5d72da":"Printing the layers of our model:","2f4785aa":"OK.

This is specially good when we are working with trees but to get assured that this choice is suitable to a model such like a Logistic Regression, we must have values that follow a linear relationship with the probability of getting a one in the output.

Variances and Features Importance\n\nSuppose we have two non orthogonal vectors in a bidimentional space and we want to calculate the sum of the variance along the $2$ dimensions. Then we have:\n\n$$Var(X_{12}) = Var(X_1) + Var(X_2) + 2.Cov(X_1, X_2)$$\n\nAfter applying a PCA over this pair, we obtain $2$ orthogonal vectors and the total variance can be calculated without the covariance term:\n\n$$Var(X^*_{12}) = Var(X^*_1) + Var(X^*_2)$$\n\nWhere:\n$$ X^*_1 = \\Lambda . (X_1 - \\mu_{1,2}) $$\n$$ X^*_2 = \\Lambda . (X_2 - \\mu_{1,2}) $$\n$$ X^*_1 \\perp X^*_2 \\rightarrow X^*_1 \\bullet X^*_2 = 0 $$\n$$ \\mu_{1,2} = \\frac{X_1 + X_2}{2} $$\n\nAnd $\\Lambda$ is our linear transformation PCA matrix. When we lose the covariance term and subtract the mean of each vector, something magic happens:\n\n$$ Var({X^*_k}) = \\mathbb{E} [{X^*_k}^2 - \\mathbb{E} [{X^*_k}]^2] $$\n\nSince we centered our data:\n\n$ \\mathbb{E} [{X^*_k}]^2 = 0 $\n\nThen:\n\n$\\frac{Var({X^*_k})}{Var_{Total}} = \\frac{\\mathbb{E} [{X^*_k}^2]}{Var_{Total}} = \\frac{|| {X^*_k}^2 ||_2}{Var_{Total}}$\n\nAnd the participation of each feature over the total variance is proportional to the squared norm of the principal component!

It consists in transforming each category into the averages of the targets obtained for this category. \n\nI am considering that our ordinal feature with a high number of different values (ord_5) is categorical: we have $2$ random letters together, some of them in uppercase, some of them in lowercase characters and I am not really sure about how could I possibly transform it to an ordinal number that makes sense (should we sum the ASCII values? Should we sum the ASCII values after transforming the characters to their lowercase versions?)","a49a689a":"We can check the distribution of the scores before grouping the AUC values per folds and after taking the mean. Before taking the average:","54fc236c":"The best model is the last one: when we take the average of the best models and they have different predictions, then we create a better estimator, thanks to the central limit theorem:\n\n![Central Limit Theorem](https:\/\/i.stack.imgur.com\/wPGzI.png)\n\nWe can imagine that each model is a \"coin\" with a good probability to take a $1$ (imagine that we we have a $0$ in one side and a $1$ on the other side). So, if the coins generate reasonably independent results and we take the average value that we get after flipping them, we will tend to get a normal distribution, with a low standard deviation and centered around a value that is near to one (closer than the expected value of the Bernouilli distribution of each individual coin!)\n\nThe theory justifies the better results :)\n\nSo, maybe, we can apply a **MonteCarlo Dropout** instead of removing the Dropout effect during the testing phase (Keras does it by default). With this approach, we convert our deterministic neural network into a probabilistic one and then we can create many different estimators and get the average predictions. Many different configurations with few weights will be considered:\n\n![Dropout Figure](https:\/\/encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com\/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcSz-CH9Jv9p3gJjn8pSF3EHebiRHUof84YOzExRI3QuCzqubwkn)","7090962b":"The red \"X\" is marked over the points where the cumulative importance is really, really near of $100 \\%$.
