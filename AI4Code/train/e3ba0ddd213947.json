We can understand that free courses are short mini course while paid ones takes the concepts and course in depth***\n\n***3.We can see courses that cost around 50 dollars have highest duration followed by the courses worth 20 dollars. This could be because udemy keep offfering high courses to users at 20 dollars sometimes.***\n\n***4.Almost 50% of courses available are of equal level for all learners. Then 35% are begineers level  followed by 11% of intermediate level. Only 2% of entire course consist of expert level.***\n\n***5.There are outliers in beginner level data. We expert level to have lower content duration. All levels being the mostly time consuming courses.***\n\n***6.We can see that number number of subscribers is closely related with number of reviews. Thus we can see more people taking courses and hence they subscribe to those courses and automatically the course get high subscribers.***\n\n***7.We have number of subscribers negetively correlated with paid courses.
