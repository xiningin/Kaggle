","be1c359e":"But the key question here is with what logic or rule, point B can be represented in terms of A and angle L. Or in other terms, what is the equation among B, A and L. The answer is straigtforward, there is no fixed equation but a best possible equation is obtained by the unsupervised learning process. In simple terms, the learning process can be defined as a rule \/ equation which converts B in the form of A and L. Lets understand this process from a autoencoder perspective. \n\nConsider the autoencoder with no hidden layers, the inputs x1 and x2 are encoded to lower repersentation d which is then further projected into x1 and x2. \n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/lfq4eEy.png)\n\n<br>\n**Step1 : Repersent the points in Latent View Space**   \n\nIf the coordinates of point A and B in the data representation space are: \n\n- Point A : (x1A, x2A)  \n- Point B : (x1B, x2B)   \n\nthen their coordinates in the latent view space will be:  \n\n- Point A : (0, 0)  \n- Point B : (u1B, u2B)  \n\nu1B = x1B - x1A\nu2B = x2B - x2A\n\n**Step2 : Represent the points with distance d and angle L **    \n\nNow, u1B and u2B can represented as a combination of distance d and angle L. And if we rotate this by angle L, towards the horizontal axis, L will become 0. ie.  \n\n**=> (d, L)**     \n**=> (d, 0)**   (after rotation)   \n\nThis is the output of the encoding process and repersents our data in low dimensions.  If we recall the fundamental equation of a neural network with weights and bias of every layer, then \n\n**=> (d, 0) = W. (u1B, u2B)**    \n==> (encoding)    \n\nwhere W is the weight matrix of hidden layer.  Since, we know that the decoding process is the mirror image of the encoding process. \n\n**=> (u1B, u2B) = Inverse (W) . (d, 0)**    \n==> (decoding)  \n\nThe reduced form of data (x1, x2) is (d, 0) in the latent view space which is obtained from the encoding architecture. Similarly, the decoding architecture converts back this representation to original form (u1B, u2B) and then (x1, x2). An important point is that Rules \/ Learning function \/ encoding-decoding equation will be different for different types of data. For example, consider the following data in 2dimentional space.  \n\n\n## Different Rules for Different data\n\nSame rules cannot be applied to all types of data.

The intution is, In the manifold space, deep neural networks has the property to bend the space in order to obtain a linear data fold view. Autoencoder architectures applies this property in their hidden layers which allows them to learn low level representations in the latent view space. \n\nThe following image describes this property: \n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/gKCOdiL.png)\n\nLets implement an autoencoder using keras that first learns the features from an image, and then tries to project the same image as the output.  \n\n### 1.

","490b325a":"## Simple Tutorial to Understand How Autoencoders work\n\nAutoencoders are a special type of neural network architectures in which the output is same as the input. Autoencoders are trained in an unsupervised manner in order to learn the exteremely low level repersentations of the input data. These low level features are then deformed back to project the actual data. An autoencoder is a regression task where the network is asked to predict its input (in other words, model the identity function). These networks has a tight bottleneck of a few neurons in the middle, forcing them to create effective representations that compress the input into a low-dimensional code that can be used by the decoder to reproduce the original input.\n\nA typical autoencoder architecture comprises of three main components: \n\n- **Encoding Architecture :** The encoder architecture comprises of series of layers with decreasing number of nodes and ultimately reduces to a latent view repersentation.  \n- **Latent View Repersentation :** Latent view repersents the lowest level space in which the inputs are reduced and information is preserved.  \n- **Decoding Architecture :** The decoding architecture is the mirro image of the encoding architecture but in which number of nodes in every layer increases and ultimately outputs the similar (almost) input.  \n\n![](**https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Rrmaise.png**)\n\nA highly fine tuned autoencoder model should be able to reconstruct the same input which was passed in the first layer. In this kernel, I will walk you through the working of autoencoders and their implementation.

Lets try to understand the encoding process with an example.  Consider a data repersentation space (N dimentional space which is used to repersent the data) and consider the data points repersented by two variables : x1 and x2. Data Manifold is the space inside the data repersentation space in which the true data resides. ","014bd1f2":"### 3.
