From 1995-2010 the ownership was 25% Energia a Russian company, Boeing owning 40%, Aker Solutions a Norwegian company owning 20%, and a Ukrain company named Yuzhnoye at 15%. In 2010 however, Russia purchased the vast majority of the company bringing its total ownership to 95% with Boeing and Aker solution each with 2.5%. the company recently changed hands again to total ownership by a Russian airline S7. Since it is hard to lump it into either country and the majority of its launches happened during the 95-2010 window it will remain its own observation for later examination.","37fd6c98":"   We are in the dawn of a second Space Race. We saw this technological arms race emerge between the Cold War rivals, the Soviet Union, and the United States, to achieve first in spaceflight. This original race. This original race went from 1955-1975 culminating with the US achieving the first moon landing and space walk-in in 1969. After The US had won the race to the moon the Soviet Union transitioned its efforts towards an orbital space station. They accomplished this when their 3 man crew Successfully docked and remained attached to the [Salyut 1](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Salyut_1), the Societ laboratory, for a record 22 days. This race left in wake many wonderful technologies we could not function without to this day. Technologies I'm sure you are using right now like camera phones, computer mouses, and scratch-Resistant lenses just to name a few. This race allowed tensions during the cold war to 'thaw' for some time through a negotiation known as [D\u00e9tente](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/D%C3%A9tente). \n\n   Many years went by with these organizations and many others quietly working in the background with only the most momentous of achievements reaching the general public. Until the birth of the second space race known as the [Billionaire Space Race](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Billionaire_space_race) these men are the leaded edge of what is being referred to as the New Space Age. No longer is this a matter of countries going head to head. In New Space, we have private organizations leading the charge. I'm extremely interested to see how these private organizations stack up against the state-run goliaths of the earlier era. \n\n   Below I will attempt to explore this relationship between State and Private organizations. This will include adding additional data from the personal research focused on the organizations themselves. ","514f3b58":"Another interesting column we are going to add is Private or State Run. This information was readily available while I was looking into the company's country of origin so I jotted it down. This category does come with its issues, however. While setting up this column you run into organizations like Sea Launch. Sea launch is a multinational organization that was founded with Boeing and some other organizations some of which are state-run. Making Sea Launch a mix of both Private and State funding. Yet it is run as a private organization so it will be deemed Private.
