Having a month to month contract is more expensive than signing a one or two year contract\n3. Customers without dependents in their household pay more than those with dependents\n4. Senior citizens pay more as a group monthly than non-senior citizens\n5. A quarter of senior citizens don\u2019t utilize Telcom\u2019s tech support. Customers who utilize tech support tend to spend slightly more on monthly services and don\u2019t cancel services as often\n6. Nearly a quarter of senior citizens don\u2019t use the tv or movie streaming services provided by Telcom, however over 25% have fiber optic high speed internet provided by Telcom\n7. Both seniors and non-seniors are likely to cancel their Telcom services before spending more than $1,500 total on Telcom services.\n\n**Suggestions**\n\nCustomers with dependents represent an opportunity to upsell additional services. A marketing outreach to this segment may be warranted. Since customers tend to spend more on services over time this effect could be amplified in households with dependents after conducting a marketing campaign to reach those individuals. A marketing campaign to reach out to senior citizens will improve Telcom\u2019s churn rate for this group by assisting them with their technological needs while also informing that group of additional services Telcom offers. Providing customer service is highly crucial to customers who have spent less than $1500 on Telcom\u2019s services. During this spending period service cancelation is highly probable. With continued customer support during this period customer churn can be greatly reduced. \n\n","1c57d320":"**Hypothesis Testing**\n"}}
