recent day. For epidemics that have $R_t>1$ for a long time and then become under control ($R_t<1$), the posterior gets stuck. It cannot forget about the many days where $R_t>1$ so eventually $P(R_t|k)$ asymptotically approaches 1 when we know it's well under 1. The authors note this in the paper as a footnote. Unfortunately this won't work for us. __The most critical thing to know is when we've dipped below the 1.0 threshold!__\n\nSo, I propose to only incorporate the last $m$ days of the likelihood function. By doing this, the algorithm's prior is built based on the recent past which is a much more useful prior than the entire history of the epidemic. So this simple, but important change leads to the following:\n\n$$ P(R_t|k_t) \\propto {\\displaystyle \\prod^{T}_{t=T-m}}\\mathcal{L}\\left(R_t|k_t\\right) $$\n\nWhile this takes the last $m$ priors into account equally, you can decide to apply a windowing function (such as an exponential) to favor recent priors over more distant.","6c28f7b9":"### Plot a list of Countries","12fb230e":"### Choosing a Likelihood Function $\\mathcal{L}\\left(R_t|k_t\\right)$\n\nA likelihood function function says how likely a value of $R_t$ is given an observed number of new cases $k$.\n\nAny time you need to model 'arrivals' over some time period of time, statisticians like to use the [Poisson Distribution](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Poisson_distribution).

The goal is to combine the information we have about previous days with the current day.

Let's do that using the cumulative product of each successive day:","f43a6706":"## Bettencourt & Ribeiro's Approach\n\nEvery day, we learn how many more people have COVID-19. This new case count gives us a clue about the current value of $R_t$. We also, figure that the value of $R_t$ today is related to the value of $R_{t-1}$ (yesterday's value) and every previous value of $R_{t-m}$ for that matter.\n\nWith these insights, the authors use [Bayes' rule](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bayes%27_theorem) to update their beliefs about the true value of $R_t$ based on how many new cases have been reported each day.\n\nThis is Bayes' Theorem as we'll use it:\n\n$$ P(R_t|k)=\\frac{P(R_t)\\cdot\\mathcal{L}(R_t|k)}{P(k)} $$\n\nThis says that, having seen $k$ new cases, we believe the distribution of $R_t$ is equal to:\n\n- The __prior__ beliefs of the value of $P(R_t)$ without the data ...\n- times the __likelihood__ of $R_t$ given that we've seen $k$ new cases ...\n- divided by the probability of seeing this many cases in general.\n\nImportantly, $P(k)$ is a constant, so the numerator is proportional to the posterior. Since all probability distributions sum to 1.0, we can ignore $P(k)$ and normalize our posterior to sum to 1.0:\n\n$$ P(R_t|k) \\propto P(R_t) \\cdot \\mathcal{L}(R_t|k) $$\n\nThis is for a single day. To make it iterative: every day that passes, we use yesterday's conclusion (ie. posterior) $P(R_{t-1}|k_{t-1})$ to be today's prior $P(R_t)$ so on day two:\n\n$$ P(R_2|k) \\propto P(R_0)\\cdot\\mathcal{L}(R_2|k_2)\\cdot\\mathcal{L}(R_1|k_1) $$\n\nAnd more generally:\n\n$$ P(R_t|k_t) \\propto P(R_0) \\cdot {\\displaystyle \\prod^{T}_{t=0}}\\mathcal{L}(R_t|k_t) $$\n\nWith a uniform prior $P(R_0)$, this reduces to:\n\n$$ P(R_t|k_t) \\propto {\\displaystyle \\prod^{T}_{t=0}}\\mathcal{L}\\left(R_t|k_t\\right) $$","7ddbe44c":"Since our results include uncertainty, we'd like to be able to view the most likely value of $R_t$ along with its highest-density interval.","73c81c43":"Taking a look at the <b>Costa Rica<\/b> as an example, we need to start the analysis when there are a consistent number of cases each day.

It's the number of people who become infected per infectious person at time $t$. The most well-known version of this number is the basic reproduction number: $R_0$ when $t=0$. However, $R_0$ is a single measure that does not adapt with changes in behavior and restrictions.\n\nAs a pandemic evolves, increasing restrictions (or potential releasing of restrictions) change $R_t$. Knowing the current $R_t$ is essential. When $R>1$, the pandemic will spread through the entire population. If $R_t<1$, the pandemic will grow to some fixed number less than the population. The lower $R_t$, the more manageable the situation. The value of $R_t$ helps us (1) understand how effective our measures have been controlling an outbreak and (2) gives us vital information about whether we should increase or reduce restrictions based on our competing goals of economic prosperity and human safety. [Well-respected epidemiologists argue](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/04\/06\/opinion\/coronavirus-end-social-distancing.html) that tracking $R_t$ is the only way to manage through this crisis.\n\nYet, today, to my knowledge there is no real-time tracking of $R_t$ in United States. In fact, the only real-time measure I've seen has been for [Hong Kong](https:\/\/covid19.sph.hku.hk\/dashboard). More importantly, it is not useful to understand $R_t$ at a national level. Instead, to manage this crisis effectively, we need a local (state, county and\/or city) level granularity of $R_t$.\n\nWhat follows is a solution to this problem at the US State level. It's a modified version of a solution created by [Bettencourt & Ribeiro 2008](https:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0002185) to estimate real-time $R_t$ using a Bayesian approach.
