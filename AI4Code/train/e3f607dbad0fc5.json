I did however find the existence of [scipy.stats.probplot()](https:\/\/docs.scipy.org\/doc\/scipy\/reference\/generated\/scipy.stats.probplot.html).  So, in the way of python, I'm going to create my own little methods to produce faceted quantile-quantile plots.","55bf5455":"So what can I gather from the inital exploratory stuff.  There are 569 rows, 33 columns and no missing data, which is great!  We have this random 'Unamed 32' feature that needs to go away. All features are numerical.  On to univariate exploratory analysis.","1d9109fd":"These plots typically help me see if there are any serious outliers at specific indices for a feature.  Overall, these figures hint at the idea that there might be some really great features for helping to separate the **begning** and **malignant** classes of the **diagnosis** target variable.","af49649a":"## Boxplots","57c81fe3":"Because this is my very first kernel, I'm not going to mess with the cell stuff above!

There are a series of tests that I found that can test whether a distribution of values deviate significantly from a normal distribution.  I'm going to implement a small fucntion that can be applied across all the features.","277b3f77":"Here I transformed the data into long form and then created histogram and density plots for every numeric feature and then again with respect to the target variable **diagnosis**.  I noticed that some of the density plots appeared bi-modal and by separating the values by **diagnosis**, we can see that some of the features actually do have different distributions with respect to the target variable.  This evidence suggests that some of these features might be really useful in a predictive model while some others could probably be thrown away. For example **fractal_dimension_mean**, **texture_se**, **smoothness_se**, **symmetry_se**, **fractal_dimension_se** provide no clear separation for the two classes of the **diagnosis** target variable.\n","70ca152c":"# Wisconsin Breast Cancer \n\nThis purpose of this kernel is to really get as much feed back as to what I might be doing incorrectly and how I can improve.  This is a work in progress.  My inital goal is to try out some exploratory data analysis stuff, maybe some predictive stuff, and then possibly some interpretive machine learning stuff.  \n\nLet's see how this goes!"}}
