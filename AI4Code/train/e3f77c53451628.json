Usually, this is done on lymph nodes that are enlarged.\n This is called a needle biopsy. The tissue that\u2019s removed is looked at under the microscope by a pathologist (a doctor who diagnoses illness using tissue samples) \n to find out if there are cancer cells in it, but this is where we come in to make models that could classify and help the pathologist with his job.","4de14b4f":"1. declare the specification of our model(arch, bs, size,...)\n2. create a dataframe and look at how ur labels are formated \n3. set your transforms \n4. create a databunch (with the declared size but we're gonna increase it and tune the model more) \n5. look at your data and understand it \n6. create a learner \n7. train for a while. after performing lr_find \n8. unfreeze and retrain and once ur happy with the model export it  \n9. increase size \n10. do 4->7->8 again ","f0cd797b":"**<h1>Create the model**"}}
