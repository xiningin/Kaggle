First I've tried Bag of words methods: nltk, tokenize, lemmatize, remove stopwords, TF-IDF and then run it using Random Forest Classifier getting to **56%** accuracy on validation data. Not as good as I would expect so wanted to try deep nets what we can get out of here. My best result was **68%** accuracy on validation data and 65% accuracy on test data (submission).","0f904671":"## Split data into training and testing set\nIt's good to mention we does not need to do this step, as we can ask tensorflow to put partition of data outside and use it as validation set","8988f5fe":"## Conlusion\nMy solution use very simple model, however using more complex (using convolutional nets, double\/triple gru, combination of bidirectional, more dense layers, different dropout, using LSTM, increasing units & embedding layer size had actually minimum effect on final results.","64c9404c":"# Text classification using Deep Learning - Tensorflow v2 & Keras - Bi-directional GRU ","b9c49d48":"## Labels preprocessing\nIn tensorflow, if we deal with multinomial target, we must convert vector to matrix having as many columns as much targets we have.

Can be 100,500 or even 1000. Basically if EMBEDDING_DIM == vocabulary_size, then it's identical to bag of words, but you cannot handle it if you have 300 000 of words, would be sparse matrix with 99.99% of values to be zero.\nInstead, embedding layer will be dense and have much smaller dimension.\n"}}
