I can check the meaningful results.\n- You can see the number of sharing increasing between 7-9 and 17-19. We need to check the detailed customer, but we can infer that the amount of bicycle sharing increases during rush hour or school hours. We look forward to having a good effect when we come up with a target marketing plan.\n- sharing looks different holiday and workingday. On woringday, the amount of sharing increases during rush hour and back-to-school hours, but on holiday, it increases during lunchtime. I think I need a different way of marketing on holiday and workinday.\n- In a similar context, if you compare the days of the week, you can see the difference between weekends and weekdays. Similarly, services must be provided separately from weekends and weekdays.\n- The effect of seasonal and weather on bike sharing seems to be consistent with common sense. In the summer when it's good to ride a bike, there's the most sharing, and in the winter when it's not good to ride a bike, there's the least sharing. On bad weather,there are fewer sharing, and on good weather, there are more sharing.","156c5463":"### We make number of sharing per hour, year, month, and day. We can make some inferences about the content of the graph.\n- It does not appear to have grown over the years. 2017 data is not enough\n- The date does not appear to have a significant impact on the number of sharing\n- It looks like there are a lot of sharing between June and August.\n- Looks like a lot of sharing at 7-9 and 17-19.","4bb6fc7d":"## EDA"}}
