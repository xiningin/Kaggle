A statistical model can be used or not, but primarily EDA is for seeing what the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task. Exploratory data analysis was promoted by **John Tukey** to encourage statisticians to explore the data, and possibly formulate hypotheses that could lead to new data collection and experiments.\n\n\n## What do you gain through EDA?\n\nBelow are few among many points where EDA helps us:\n\n- maximize insight into a data set;\n- uncover underlying structure;\n- extract important variables;\n- detect outliers and anomalies;\n- test underlying assumptions;\n- develop parsimonious models; and\n- determine optimal factor settings.\n\n## EDA Techniques\n\nMost EDA techniques are graphical in nature with a few quantitative techniques. The reason for the heavy reliance on graphics is that by its very nature the main role of EDA is to open-mindedly explore, and graphics gives the analysts unparalleled power to do so, enticing the data to reveal its structural secrets, and being always ready to gain some new, often unsuspected, insight into the data.\n\nThe particular graphical techniques employed in EDA are often quite simple, consisting of various techniques of:\n\n- Plotting the raw data (such as data traces, histograms, bihistograms, probability plots, lag plots, block plots, and Youden plots.\n- Plotting simple statistics such as mean plots, standard deviation plots, box plots, and main effects plots of the raw data.\n- Positioning such plots so as to maximize our natural pattern-recognition abilities, such as using multiple plots per page.","844a45b3":"## All India GER","df65de37":"- Another important need and I see a consistent rise in Percentage across all Schools.","fe020e25":"# Dropout Ratio ","9031e9b0":"**What is Dropout Ratio?**\n\nThere are varying definitions on the web for Dropout Ratio. I will keep it simple here. Dropout Ratio simply means any student who leaves school for any reason before graduation or completion of a program of studies without transferring to another school.\n\nIt is very clear from the graph that we have high number of dropouts from **Secondary Girls**. Secondary Education entails 9th and 10th grades. So, there could be many reasons why the dropout is increasing at this grade level. It could be one of these reasons:\n\n- Students feel the pressure of 10th board exams and do not possess the will to continue education thereafter.\n- Since India is a developing country, many girl students from rural areas do not have support to continue education after reaching this grade and they simply think this level of education is enough for girls.\n- etc.\n- The same pattern of Dropout Ratio is being repeated for Boys as well.\n- This is a very serious issue that Indian Government should be considering and find the root cause for it to solve this problem.","8a30a337":"### Girls\n\nLet's see how the trends have been in Gross Enrollment Ratio for Girls.\n\n- Girls who join Primary School have exceeded 100 GER which means the students also include who are repeating a grade, or those who enrolled late and are older than their classmates, or those who have advanced quickly and are younger than their classmates. This is a positive sign in a developing country like India.\n- However, the ratio has been consistently decreasing over the years. There could be two reasons for this decrease:\n    1. Either students who are repeating grades & those who have enrolled late are decreasing over time,\n    2. Or, there's an actual decrease in enrollments for primary schools among girls.\n- Indian Government has look into this to take a quick action if it's the second reason.\n- There's a considerable increase in GER from 2013-2016 for girls who are joining Upper Primary, Secondary, and Higher Secondary Schools. This is again a very positive sign.\n\n### Boys\n\nLet's see how the trends have been in Gross Enrollment Ratio for Boys.\n\n- The trends for Primary Schools are the same as girls. Again, if we could look further into data about the GER, we could gather some important information as to why there's a decrease in GER for Girls and Boys.\n- Compared to Girls, the GER of Boys in Upper Primary is very low. This is a negative sign because this might affect the enrollments of Secondary and Higher Secondary Schools among boys.\n\n### General\n\n- We can also observe that there's a big difference between Secondary and Higher Secondary Enrollments. There could be many reasons like:\n    1. Students might migrate to better colleges in cities\/towns.\n    2. They might enroll themselves in Coaching Centres such as IIT\/AIEEE\/etc.\n","4a721f1c":"We now have a clean dataframe to work with.","a4fa6e77":"## Note\n\nThe dataset for these statistics are acquired from Indian Government's Open Data Source Portal. It's really concerning to see so much of data is Not Recorded for both GER and Dropout Ratio.","42e43be4":"- If you notice in 2013-14 school year, the facilities of toilets is really low for Higher Secondary Schools but they have a sudden growth from 2014-2015. \n- Thanks to Indian Government that there are many programs and intiatives undertaken by States and the Centre to ensure people have basic sanitary facilities in every field.","77660b51":"# Gross Enrollment Ratio\n\nGross Enrolment Ratio (GER) or Gross Enrolment Index (GEI) is a statistical measure used in the education sector, to determine the **number of students enrolled in school at several different grade levels (like elementary, middle school and high school), and use it to show the ratio of the number of students who live in that country to those who qualify for the particular grade level**.\n\nThe GER can be over 100% as it includes students who may be older or younger than the official age group. \n\nFor instance, in India it improved from 25.8 to 26.3, the **GER includes students who are repeating a grade, those who enrolled late and are older than their classmates, or those who have advanced quickly and are younger than their classmates**.
