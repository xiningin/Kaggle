It is also evident that the number of links on a page plays a big role in detecting disaster tweets. Maybe this could be a variable used in other kernels to improve scores.

The most prominent difference being the number of instances. In that case, we have more non-disaster than disaster tweets in the training dataset. This distribution study is very important to do because there are cases (such as fake news detection mentioned earlier) in which both distributions have statistically different distributions, and this fact may help in detection.\n\nWe are ready to make a first model out of the variables we have. Let's create a simple train-test split.","6439830f":"![](https:\/\/d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net\/d5cbc4b0e14c20f877366b69b9171649afe11fda\/d96a8\/assets\/images\/bigram-hmm\/pos-title.jpg)\n\n# Introduction\n\nWhen creating machine learning models using NLP, people generally tend to use techniques that deal directly with the words in the text, such as bag of words. However, one could wonder, is there a difference between the frequency of adjectives, verbs and substantives in disasters tweets when compared to common tweets? This is a good technique when dealing with long texts (above 100 words usually), but maybe it's worth trying it here. It has also been tested to detect fake news with a very good accuracy [by the authors of this github repo](https:\/\/github.com\/roneysco\/Fake.br-Corpus).\n\nQuoting wikipedia,\n> In corpus linguistics, part-of-speech tagging (POS tagging or PoS tagging or POST), also called grammatical tagging or word-category disambiguation, is the process of marking up a word in a text (corpus) as corresponding to a particular part of speech, based on both its definition and its context\u2014i.e., its relationship with adjacent and related words in a phrase, sentence, or paragraph. A simplified form of this is commonly taught to school-age children, in the identification of words as nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, etc. \n\nBasically, what we want to do is to use NLTK library to pos-tag a sentence and count the number of each class on them. \n","5ce94655":"And the feature importance is","08d70b4d":"### Verb Frequency","58123ba8":"Now we have the POS tags for every text. There are lots of categories and I'll focus only in a few of them. Here are the meanings:\n\n- NN: noun (there are other categories that can fit within this one for our purposes, such as NNS, NNP, NNPS, which all belong to nouns, containing plurals and proper names)\n- RB: adverb\n- VB: verb (and similar categories indicating tense: VBP, VBG, VBS..)\n- JJ: adjective or numeral\n\n\n**Note:** *If you want to get more information about the classes that pos_tag can identify, use the command `nltk.help.upenn_tagset(\"NNS\")` for instance. If you want to see all the similar categories, you can just write the first letter of the class: `nltk.help.upenn_tagset(\"N\")`.*"}}
