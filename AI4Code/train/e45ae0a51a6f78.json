This is similar to target encoding in that it's based on the target probablity for a given value.

For example, if the value \"GB\" occured 10 times in the country feature, then each \"GB\" would be replaced with the number 10.\n\nWe'll use the [`categorical-encodings` package](https:\/\/github.com\/scikit-learn-contrib\/categorical-encoding) to get this encoding. The encoder itself is available as `CountEncoder`. This encoder and the others in `categorical-encodings` work like scikit-learn transformers with `.fit` and `.transform` methods.","2fd1534e":"# Introduction\n\nNow that you've built a baseline model, you are ready to improve it with some clever ways to work with categorical variables. \n\nYou are already familiar with the most basic encodings: one-hot encoding and label encoding.  In this tutorial, you'll learn about **count encoding**, **target encoding**, and **CatBoost encoding**.\n\nWe begin by running the code to rebuild the baseline model from the first tutorial.","294631da":"# Target Encoding\n\nTarget encoding replaces a categorical value with the average value of the target for that value of the feature. For example, given the country value \"CA\", you'd calculate the average outcome for all the rows with `country == 'CA'`, around 0.28. This is often blended with the target probability over the entire dataset to reduce the variance of values with few occurences.\n\nThis technique uses the targets to create new features. So including the validation or test data in the target encodings would be a form of target leakage. Instead, you should learn the target encodings from the training dataset only and apply it to the other datasets.\n\nThe `category_encoders` package provides `TargetEncoder` for target encoding. The implementation is similar to `CountEncoder`.","0333dee1":"This does slightly better than target encoding."}}
