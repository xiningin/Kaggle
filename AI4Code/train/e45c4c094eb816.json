There\u2019s always a small amount of liquid within this lining to help lubricate the lungs as they expand within the chest during breathing.\n\nThe pleura creates too much fluid when it\u2019s irritated, inflamed, or infected. This fluid accumulates in the chest cavity outside the lung, causing what\u2019s known as a pleural effusion.\n\nCertain types of cancer can cause pleural effusions, lung cancer in men and breast cancer in women being the most common. other causes can be pulmonary embolism and pneumonia for example.\n\n![RCNi - pleural effusion](https:\/\/dm3omg1n1n7zx.cloudfront.net\/rcni\/static\/journals\/ns\/28\/41\/ns.28.41.51.e8849\/graphic\/ns_v28_n41_8849_0001.jpg)\n\n\nImaging criteria are (found [here](http:\/\/www.stritch.luc.edu\/lumen\/MedEd\/Radio\/curriculum\/Medicine\/Pleural_effusion1.htm), pretty good details !):\n\n    Homogenous density\n    Density in dependent portion\n        Upright: Costophrenic angle in PA view\n        Lateral view: Anterior and posterior portions of gutter\n        Lateral decubitus position: Along sides\n        Supine position: Along posteriorly, giving diffuse haziness on the side of effusion\n    Silhouette of upper limit of density\n        Upper margin high in axilla in PA view (yellow arrows)\n        Upper margin high anteriorly and posteriorly in lateral view\n        This is just an illusion\n    Loss of silhouette.

The problem is it's so similar to the consolidation that it became hard to distinguish them apart.","889d36de":"In an effort to provide a large dataset of chest x-ray (CXR) images with high-quality labels for the research community, VinBigData have built the VinDr-CXR dataset from more than 100,000 raw images in DICOM format that were retrospectively collected from the Hospital 108 and the Hanoi Medical University Hospital, two of the largest hospitals in Vietnam.\n\nOut of this raw data, they release 18 000  postero-anterior (PA) view CXR scans that come with both the localization of critical findings and the classification of common thoracic diseases. These images were annotated by a group of 17 radiologists with at least 8 years of experience for the presence of 22 critical findings (local labels) and 6 diagnoses (global labels); each finding is localized with a bounding box while the global labels reflect the diagnostic impression of the radiologist.\n\nThe released dataset is divided into a training set of 15,000 and a test set of 3,000. Each scan in the training set was independently labeled by 3 radiologists, while each scan in the test set was labeled by the consensus of 5 radiologis.\n\nWhy that is super cool ? because as the Vingroup said in their recent paper [\u201cVinDr-CXR: An open dataset of chest X-rays with radiologist's annotations\u201d](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/pdf\/2012.15029.pdf), most of the existing chest X-ray datasets include labels from a list of findings without specifying their locations on the radiographs. This limits the development of machine learning algorithms for the detection and localization of chest abnormalities. \n\nFor example, the MIMIC-CXR dataset release in 2019 contains more than 377 000 CXR images but these are image-level labeled (no bounding-box, just an image label) and like most of the other existing CXR datasets, its depend on automated rule-based labelers that either use keyword matching or an NLP model to extract disease labels from free-text radiology reports. These tools can produce labels on a large scale but, at the same time, introduce a high rate of inconsistency, uncertainty, and errors as mentionned the paper.\n\nSo with this competition, we benefit from the knowledge of several experienced radiologists to hopefully help building an automated system that could accurately identify and localize findings on chest radiographs.\n\nSo it is pretty clair by now that we are going to work with X-ray images and to be more precise, chest X-ray.

X-ray imaging creates pictures of the inside of your body. The images show the parts of your body in different shades of black and white. This is because different tissues absorb different amounts of radiation. Calcium in bones absorbs x-rays the most, so bones look white. Fat and other soft tissues absorb less and look gray. Air absorbs the least, so for example lungs which are full of air look black.\n\nThe most familiar use of x-rays is checking for fractures (broken bones), but x-rays are also used in other ways. For example, chest x-rays can spot pneumonia and mammograms use x-rays to look for breast cancer.\n\nA chest x-ray is an x-ray of the chest, lungs, heart, large arteries, ribs, and diaphragm. There are several CXR views. In this competition we will only have to deal with  postero-anterior (PA) views. That mean that the patient stands in front of a radiographic plate, hands on hips, with the X-ray source 2\u202fm behind.\n\n### **A normal CXR**\n\nIt is important to know the normal chest radiograph and common landmarks so that we can recognize what is abnormal.  \n\n![Chest Radiograph - Normal](https:\/\/www.ebmconsult.com\/content\/images\/Xrays\/ChestXrayAPNmlLabeled.png)\n\nNote that the left side of the subject is on the right side of the image. In most CXR a little R or L will indicate the side.\n\nHere are some common landmarks for the normal CXR:\n\n- The trachea should sit midline and be in between the right and left clavicular heads.\n- The carina is the point or level at which the trachea divides into the right and left main bronchi.  This is usually midline with the spinous process being behind it. \n- The aortic knob should be visualized in the normal chest radiograph around the level of T3 to T4 or just lateral to the carina. \n- Usually the heart is positioned with one-third of its diameter to the right, and two-thirds to the left of the thoracic vertebrae spinous processes.\n- The right hemidiaphragm normally sits slightly higher than the left due to the presence of the liver under the diaphragm.\n\n\nNote that the T4 (for example) vertebra is the fourth thoracic vertebra that makes up the middle segment of spinal column of the human body. The thoracic spinal vertebrae consist of 12 total vertebrae and are located between the cervical vertebrae (which begin at the base of the skull) and the lumbar spinal vertebrae.\n\n\nAfter this breif introduction about the construction of the dataset, the reminder about X-ray and the presentation of a normal CXR, we can move on to see some of the abnormal CXR and by extention talk about our data.","0cfcc2c3":"First let's import all what we need and define our paths.
