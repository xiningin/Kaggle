It works by finding similarities between two items. In past we had very lesser options and versatalities in things, but as the world is growing the things which had limited number of options also developed with alot of options. It became very uneasy to have selections for things that we want or wanting to have. As the world grew up also the technologies in use grew up which brings us the solution of our problem called as 'Recommendation systems'. So this was the reason behind using a Recommender System.","63dfec3b":"- Online shopping apps like Amazon, Flipkart etc.","16a87dbe":"This works great.
