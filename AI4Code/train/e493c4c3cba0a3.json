Do this analysis for the **\u2018Target variable\u2019** in the dataset **( clients with payment difficulties and all other cases).** Use a mix of univariate and bivariate analysis etc.\n\n**Hint:** Since there are a lot of columns, you can run your analysis in loops for the appropriate columns and find the insights.\n\n+ Explain the results of univariate, segmented univariate, bivariate analysis, etc. in business terms.\n\n+ Find the top 10 correlation for the **Client with payment difficulties and all other cases (Target variable)**. Note that you have to find the top correlation by segmenting the data frame w.r.t to the target variable and then find the top correlation for each of the segmented data and find if any insight is there.  Say, there are 5+1(target) variables in a dataset: **Var1, Var2, Var3, Var4, Var5, Target.** And if you have to find top 3 correlation, it can be: **Var1 & Var2, Var2 & Var3, Var1 & Var3.** Target variable will not feature in this correlation as it is a categorical variable and not a continuous variable which is increasing or decreasing.  \n\n+ Include visualisations and summarise the most important results in the presentation.

","d93b516c":"# <font color = blue > EDA Case Study <\/font>\n\n### <font color = Green > Business Understanding <\/font>\n\nThe loan providing companies find it hard to give loans to the people due to their insufficient or non-existent credit history. Because of that, some consumers use it as their advantage by becoming a defaulter. **PS: Suppose you work for a consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. You have to use EDA to analyse the patterns present in the data. This will ensure that the applicants capable of repaying the loan are not rejected.**\n\n\nWhen the company receives a loan application, the company has to decide for loan approval based on the applicant\u2019s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank\u2019s decision:\n\n+ If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company\n\n+ If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he\/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.\n\nThe data given below contains the information about the loan application at the time of applying for the loan. It contains two types of scenarios:\n\n**The client with payment difficulties:** he\/she had late payment more than X days on at least one of the first Y instalments of the loan in our sample,\n\n**All other cases:** All other cases when the payment is paid on time.\n\nWhen a client applies for a loan, there are four types of decisions that could be taken by the client\/company):\n\n+ **Approved**: The Company has approved loan Application\n\n+ **Cancelled**: The client cancelled the application sometime during approval. Either the client changed her\/his mind about the loan or in some cases due to a higher risk of the client he received worse pricing which he did not want.\n\n+ **Refused**: The company had rejected the loan (because the client does not meet their requirements etc.).\n\n+ **Unused offer**:  Loan has been cancelled by the client but on different stages of the process.\n\nIn this case study, you will use EDA to understand how **consumer attributes** and **loan attributes** influence the tendency of default.\n\n\n### <font color = Green > Business Objectives <\/font>\n\nThis case study aims to **identify patterns which indicate if a client has difficulty paying their installments** which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc. This will ensure that the consumers capable of repaying the loan are not rejected. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.  **What are your driving varibles??**\n\nIn other words, the company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.  The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.","d811967a":"#### These numbers in the 'AMT_INCOME_TOTAL','AMT_CREDIT' & 'AMT_GOODS_PRICE' are too big, compromising its readability.
