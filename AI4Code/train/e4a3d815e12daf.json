The data is only of the actual revenue generation and not at bid level. The dataset has the following columns:\n\n    Date\n    site_id : each id denotes a different website\n    adtypeid : each id denotes a different ad_type. These can be display ads , video ads, text ads etc\n    geo_id : each id denotes a different country. our maximum traffic is from english speaking countries\n    devicecategoryid : each id denoted a different device_category like desktop , mobile, tablet\n    advertiser_id: each id denotes a different bidder in the auction\n    order_id : can be ignored\n    lineitemtype_id : can be ignored\n    osid : each id denotes a different operating system for mobile device category only (android , ios etc) . for all other device categories, osid will correspond to not_mobile\n    integrationtypeid : it describes how the demand partner is setup within a publisher's ecosystem - can be adserver (running through the publisher adserver) or hardcoded\n    monetizationchannelid : it describes the mode through which demand partner integrates with a particular publisher - it can be header bidding (running via prebid.js), dynamic allocation, exchange bidding, direct etc\n    adunitid - each id denotes a different ad unit (one page can have more than one ad units)\n    total_impressions - measurement column measuring the impressions for the particular set of dimensions\n    total_revenue - measurement column measuring the revenue for the particular set of dimensions\n    viewable_impressions - Number of impressions on the site that were viewable out of all measurable impressions. A display ad is counted as viewable if at least 50% of its area was displayed on screen for at least one second\n    measurable_impressions - Impressions that were measurable by Active View out of the total number of eligible impressions. This value should generally be close to 100%. For example, an impression that is rendering in a cross-domain iframe may not be measurable.\n    Revenuesharepercent - not every advertiser gives all the revenue to the publisher. They charge a certain share for the services they provide. This captures the fraction of revenue that will actually reach the publishers pocket.\n"}}
