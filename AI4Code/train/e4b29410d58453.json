It saw Alexander Lukashenko win yet another term in office and that resulted in Belarus being rocked by the biggest protests in its history. In response, the government clamped down on demonstrations through violence and arrests, with some protestors claiming the authorities used torture.\"\n\n\"Over the years, a plethora of international reports have shown just how much freedom is really curtailed in Belarus. This infographic pulls some of the most recent results together, highlighting the country's ranking in major reports we have frequently covered at Statista. For example, it only manages 148th out of 167 nations in the 2020 Democracy Index from the Economist Intelligence Unit. It also scores poorly in the 2020 World Press Freedom Index by Reporters Without Borders, coming in 158th out of 180 countries and territories.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/www.statista.com\/chart\/22612\/where-belarus-ranks-globally-in-major-international-reports\/?utm_source=Statista+Newsletters&utm_campaign=a3c8d4bc6b-All_InfographTicker_daily_COM_AM_KW20_2021_Fr_COPY&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_662f7ed75e-a3c8d4bc6b-315801217","12d23bcb":"![](https:\/\/encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com\/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRY_K1BQn61fADyTHTFGW2BMTYT4g2EqK6l-Q&usqp=CAU)quotefancy.com","7516a112":"<font color=\"#EC7063\">Abuse of Power Comes as No Surprise<\/font>\n\n\"We are Scientists, administrators, assistants, directors, editors, educators, interns, scholars, students, writers, and more\u2014workers of the world.
