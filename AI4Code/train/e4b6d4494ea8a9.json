","1d77d9f7":"## Exploratory analysis of previous 12 Premier League seasons","b5b875ca":"Arsene Wenger once said that finishing 4th in the English Premier League is a trophy ([Source](https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/football\/2012\/feb\/19\/arsene-wenger-arsenal-fourth-place). With the riches and prestige that comes with a 4th place (and thus Champions League entry) finish means that it has become a common target for teams at the beginning of a season. \n\nA common question about who might \"break into the top 4\" is also often asked. So, using Python I have started to investigate what it would take for a team to break into the top 4. \nI have started with an existing Kaggle dataget of the final Premier League tables for season 2007-8 to 2016-17. I've then created in the same format the tables for season 2017-18 & season 2018-19 and imported them into this notebook.\n\nTo begin with, I've concatenated all 12 tables into one pandas dataframe. This means the final position column ('#') will read 1 to 20, 1 to 20, 1 - 20 and so on. I also added a 'season' column so that in analysis that involves picking a subset of rows, I can see which season's the rows are from.\n\nI've printed the first 30 rows (i.e. to show the entire first table and half the second) as an example.\n\nKey: \n* '#' = Final position in table\n* MP = matches played\n* W = Wins\n* D = Draws\n* L = Losses\n* F = Goals for\n* A = Goals against\n* GD = Goal difference (goals for minus goals against)\n* P = Points (3 points for a win, 1 for a draw, 0 for a loss)\n","49588330":"Looking at the top half of last year's table, we can see how difficult it will be for new teams to break into the top 4. Looking at positions 6, 7 & 8, the need would be:\n\n* Manchester United to concede 15 less goals\n* Wolves to score 23 - 25 more goals & concede 6 fewer\n* Everton to score 16 - 20 more goals & concede 6 fewer","56263132":"# Last season\nIf we look at last season, we can see that even though our 3 conditions that (on average) are met, they do not necessarily all need to be. \n","87870bd6":"# So how do you get into the top 4?\nSimple:\n* Score 75 goals\n* Conceded less than 40\n* Get 70+ points","49c033a1":"For instance:\n* Neither Chelsea nor Tottenham met the average of 70+ goals scored, however they did meet or were within 1% of meeting the other two conditions of goals conceded and points\n* We can see that despite meeting the goals scored condition and being close on the points condition, Arsenal's goals conceded was heavily above average (34% above); limiting them to a 5th place finish. \n\nThe visualisations below display the averages of our three conditions across all final positions. A 4th visualisation shows the goals scored by a 2nd placed team against the average goals scored for a 1st place team to show another example of where conditions can be heavily above average for the respective finishing position."}}
