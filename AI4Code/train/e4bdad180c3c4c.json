It is found mainly in the heart, brain, and skeletal muscle. This article discusses the test to measure the amount of CPK in the blood.\nhttps:\/\/www.mountsinai.org\/health-library\/tests\/creatine-phosphokinase-test\n\n\n***ejection_fraction***:  Ejection fraction is a measurement of the percentage of blood leaving heart each time it contracts. The heart contracts and relaxes. When your heart contracts, it ejects blood from the two pumping chambers (ventricles). When your heart relaxes, the ventricles refill with blood. No matter how forceful the contraction, the heart can never pump all blood out of a ventricle. The term \"ejection fraction\" refers to the percentage of blood that's pumped out of a filled ventricle with each heartbeat.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.mayoclinic.org\/ejection-fraction\/expert-answers\/faq-20058286\n\n\n\n***Platelets***:Platelets are tiny blood cells that help your body form clots to stop bleeding. If one of your blood vessels gets damaged, it sends out signals to the platelets. The platelets then rush to the site of damage. they form a plug (clot) to fix the damage. A normal platelet count ranges from 150,000 to 450,000 platelets per microliter of blood. Having more than 450,000 platelets is a condition called thrombocytosis; having less than 150,000 is known as thrombocytopenia.\nhttps:\/\/www.urmc.rochester.edu\/encyclopedia\/content.aspx?ContentTypeID=160&ContentID=36\n\n\n***Serum Creatinine***: Creatinine is a chemical waste product that's produced by your muscle metabolism and to a smaller extent by eating meat. Healthy kidneys filter creatinine and other waste products from blood. The filtered waste products leave body in urine.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.mayoclinic.org\/tests-procedures\/creatinine-test\/about\/pac-20384646\n\n\n\n\n\n\n***serum_sodium***:A sodium blood test is a routine test that allows your doctor to see how much sodium is in your blood. It\u2019s also called a serum sodium test. Sodium is an essential mineral to your body. It\u2019s also referred to as Na+.\nSodium is particularly important for nerve and muscle function. Your body keeps sodium in balance through a variety of mechanisms. Sodium gets into your blood through food and drink. It leaves the blood through urine, stool, and sweat. Having the right amount of sodium is important for your health. Too much sodium can raise your blood pressure. A normal blood sodium level is between 135 and 145 milliequivalents per liter (mEq\/L). Hyponatremia occurs when the sodium in your blood falls below 135 mEq\/L. Many possible conditions and lifestyle factors can lead to hyponatremia, including: Certain medications.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.healthline.com\/health\/sodium-blood, https:\/\/www.mayoclinic.org\/diseases-conditions\/hyponatremia\/symptoms-causes\/syc-20373711"}}
