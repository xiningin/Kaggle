Read in the original raw data .\n2. Made text columns numerical by adding \"i\" (integer) columns by converting the text fields into a catagory and then converting that to a number. Did this because data needs to be numerical to use in my preliminary exploratory analysis of the data and to be used as inputs to Machine Learning models. \n3.

It just normalizes the line of scrimmage in all plays and displays the player and ball positions, orientation, and direction of motion as vectors given input play and event information (at a single moment in time). By means of having the event as an input, one can see the play and position information at a discrete and often critical point in time. Below, see the play in week 5 in which Aaron Rodgers passes deep left to DeVante Adams pushed ob at DET 9 for 30 yards (Closest Defender: Darius Slay, CB of DET).

","90b8abbb":"# Project Outcomes: Evaluating Defensive Back Domination \u274c\ud83c\udfc8\n\nWhen do Defensive Backs (DB) have a dominating presence on the field? The DB Position Group includes Safeties (S, FS, SS) and Cornerbacks (CB). DBs dominate when they effectively shut down their Receivers, cause an incomplete pass, turnover, intercept the ball, etc. For example, see[ this video](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=tcFi07b12jY) to hear former Philadelphia Eagles Safety Malcolm Jenkins break down some tactics that make for a successful Safety.\n\nHere is a summary of my project's outcomes for evaluating Defensive Back (DB) Domination for the [NFL Data Bowl 2021](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021\/overview) and [data provided](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021\/data) on drop-back pass plays for the 2018 Regular Season. See full code solution on Github [here](https:\/\/github.com\/klordi\/lordi_nfl_big_data_bowl_2021). \n","b6728e65":"## 1B. Normalized DB Separation Visualization\nFor input to the Machine Learning XGBoost Trees to classify pass outcome as Complete (0,C) or Incomplete (1,I), I thought that it would be beneficial to normalize the positions defenders and the football to the target receiver at (x,y) = (0,0) to see how these normalized positions change over the course of the play at critical events in the play such as:\n- Ball_Snap \n- Pass_Forward (moment ball leaves the QB's hands)\n- Pass_Arrived (moment ball arrives at Target Receiver)\n- Pass_Outcome (Caught, Touchdown, or Incomplete)\n- Time Intervals after Pass_Outcome_Caught to assess how well DBs stop Receivers gaining yardage after a catch (Future Work)\n- Time Intervals between each \n\nThen, I visualized the positions of DBs relative to the Normalized Target Receiver using a [Hexagonal Bin Plot](https:\/\/datavizproject.com\/data-type\/hexagonal-binning\/#:~:text=Hexagonal%20binning%20plots%20density%2C%20rather,the%20area%20of%20the%20hexagons.&text=There%20are%20many%20reasons%20for,2D%20surface%20as%20a%20plane.). Hexagonal Binning is useful because it shows density of the points, so we can see where more DBs tend to position themselves around the target receiver on Successful Completions (C) VS Incompletions (I). I binned the densities by log base 2 in order to make the color pop.\n\nIn the figures below, the plots show the target receiver in blue at the origin and the densities of how often DBs position themselves on ALL PLAYS IN 2018 around them for Completions (Figure 3) and Incompletions (Figure 4) at distances of 2, 5, and 10 yards away from the target receiver. What we can see from comparing the figures is that for Completions, more DBs are behind target receiver and the direction of the ball. This makes sense since receivers are more likely to make a completion when they're open and don't have a defender in between them and the QB. \n\nQuestions: Can we further query on orientation of defenders? can we label each chart better? I feel like some fancy math can be done to better quantify this. Make it a % so that it is even across data since there are way more completions than incompetions? ","8361db02":"# Next Steps & Future Work\nThere is alot more I could have done and to learn from, which is good!! #gainz Here are few on my mind as I wrapped up my analysis.\n\n### DB Performance Analysis & Strategy\n* Assess the quality of the position of the DB after the catch using statistical and\/or machine learning methods. For example, based on a DBs depth, position, speed, acceleration, etc. following the catch by the receiver, how many yards is the receiver likely to gain? Analyzing this is another beast. \n* Assess certain special skills that successful DBs employ depending on factors such as Game Scenario, Offensive Scheme, and Defensive Coverage. For example, like I said at the start of this notebook, see [this video](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=tcFi07b12jY) to hear former Philadelphia Eagles Safety Malcolm Jenkins break down tactics that make for a successful Safety. Also, see [this video](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=F6kYFFoVOp4) to hear  CB Xavier Rhodes breakdown his technique. \n* So much more it's football. \n\n### Machine Learning Model\n* Investigate classifying defensive coverages (Cover 0-6, Nickel, Dime, Quarters, etc.) using supervised or unsupervised machine learning methods. This can help enhance current XGBoost Model to Classify Pass Outcome. \n* Investigate classifying a play as Man VS Zone as players move around field over time.

TR-DB-Ball Triangle Visualization\n\nIn addition to calculating the distances between the Target Receiver, the Football, and Every Defender of the Field and creating new columns in the Tracking Data containing this information, I created a visualization that displays distances between the target receiver of the pass, the \ud83c\udfc8, and every defender on the field in the form of a triangle that changes size and shape throughout the course of the play.

Before getting to this point, I conducted Research (see Appendix A - Research) and started formatting the data (see Appendix B - Data Formatting for more details and full code on Github [here](https:\/\/github.com\/klordi\/lordi_nfl_big_data_bowl_2021)).

For example, the league and Next Gen Stats can report a metric called *DB Separation Rank* (or rename it something better), a new Next Gen Stat under a new Defensive Stats Category, which assesses and ranks DBs by how well a DB they cover receivers at critical points during play action such as pass_arrived and pass_forward (the moment the QB throws the ball). By creating more in-depth stats beneath this category named *DB Separation Zone Rank* and  *DB Separation Man Rank* for example that query on data such as defensive coverage, target receiver's route, yards to touchdown to quantify the amount of space available to defend on the field, down, etc., one can identify how well certain DBs and teams perform in a variety of:\n* Game Scenarios: Down, # yards to 1st down, # yards to touchdown, type dropback by QB, weather, etc.\n* Offensive Formations and Strategies: Route run by receiver, offensive formation, \n* Defensive Formations and Strategies: Defense Coverage Scheme (ie.
