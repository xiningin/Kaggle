The corresponding filepath is `cancer_b_filepath`.  Use the `\"Id\"` column to label the rows.\n- Load the data file corresponding to **malignant** tumors into a DataFrame called `cancer_m_data`.  The corresponding filepath is `cancer_m_filepath`.  Use the `\"Id\"` column to label the rows.","4c58a51e":"## Step 4: A very useful column\n\n#### Part A\n\nUse the code cell below to create two KDE plots that show the distribution in values for `'Radius (worst)'` for both benign and malignant tumors.

Each dataset has 31 different columns, corresponding to:\n- 1 column (`'Diagnosis'`) that classifies tumors as either benign (which appears in the dataset as **`B`**) or malignant (__`M`__), and\n- 30 columns containing different measurements collected from the images.\n\nUse the first 5 rows of the data (for benign and malignant tumors) to answer the questions below.","c422a72d":"#### Part B\n\nA researcher approaches you for help with identifying how the `'Area (mean)'` column can be used to understand the difference between benign and malignant tumors.  Based on the histograms above, \n- Do malignant tumors have higher or lower values for `'Area (mean)'` (relative to benign tumors), on average?\n- Which tumor type seems to have a larger range of potential values?","763ed782":"## Keep going\n\nReview all that you've learned and explore how to further customize your plots in the **[next tutorial](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/alexisbcook\/choosing-plot-types-and-custom-styles)**!","c1bffcb2":"In this exercise, you will use your new knowledge to propose a solution to a real-world scenario.  To succeed, you will need to import data into Python, answer questions using the data, and generate **histograms** and **density plots** to understand patterns in the data.\n\n## Scenario\n\nYou'll work with a real-world dataset containing information collected from microscopic images of breast cancer tumors, similar to the image below.\n\n![ex4_cancer_image](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/qUESsJe.png)\n\nEach tumor has been labeled as either [**benign**](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Benign_tumor) (_noncancerous_) or **malignant** (_cancerous_).\n\nTo learn more about how this kind of data is used to create intelligent algorithms to classify tumors in medical settings, **watch the short video [at this link](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9Mz84cwVmS0)**!","1c501819":"The questions below will give you feedback on your work.
