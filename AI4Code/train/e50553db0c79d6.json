Addressing climate change involves mitigation (i.e. mitigating greenhouse gas emissions) and adaptation (i.e. preparing for unavoidable consequences). Mitigation of GHG emissions requires changes to electricity systems, transportation, buildings, industry, and land use. <\/p>\n\n<p>According to a report issued by the International Energy Agency (IEA), the lifecycle of buildings from construction to demolition were responsible for 37% of global energy-related and process-related CO2 emissions in 2020. Yet it is possible to drastically reduce the energy consumption of buildings by a combination of easy-to-implement fixes and state-of-the-art strategies. For example, retrofitted buildings can reduce heating and cooling energy requirements by 50-90 percent. Many of these energy efficiency measures also result in overall cost savings and yield other benefits, such as cleaner air for occupants. This potential can be achieved while maintaining the services that buildings provide.<\/p>\n\n<b>Goal: <\/b> <p>\nThe goal of this competition is to predict the energy consumption using building characteristics and climate and weather variables. <\/p>"}}
