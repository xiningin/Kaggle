When the results of the survey were presented in the form of a csv pdf file, data scientists were invited to enter a competition in the form of an Exploratory Data Analysis of the results. Competitors were required to write a story concerning the results of the survey.\n\nThis story could be either on the macro level, where a group of individuals are analysed, or the micro level, where perhaps one small segment of the population is analysed.\n\nIn my EDA I decided to compare male and female data scientists in the UK who are in their sixties. I was subtly surprised to discover the results, and in the paragraphs below I will give a brief overview of my findings. \n\nIn order to analyse the data, I created a dataframe, combi, where I combined the male and female data scientists in the UK who are in their sixties. The dataset is comprised of 23 examples and 369 features.  The first three examples are the women in the UK who are in their sixties. The remaining twenty examples are the men in the UK who are in their sixties.\n\nThree hundred sixty nine columns of data is a lot of information to cover, and the contents of the cells are in the two dataframes at the bottom of this EDA. \n\nIn Kaggle\u2019s 2021 survey there are three women and twenty men in the UK in their sixties who responded to the survey.\n\nOf the highest level of education of the respondent\u2019s of the survey, one of the women had a Master\u2019s degree and at least one of the men had a PhD. \n\nThe men and women who responded to the survey have the given the following job titles:-\n\nWomen: Data Scientist, Student and Other.\n\nMen: Software Engineer, Business Analyst, Database Engineer, Research Scientist, Project Manager, Unemployed, and Other.\n\nThe men and women who responded to the survey have given the following languages they program in:-\n\nWomen: Python, R, SQL\n\nMen: Python, R, SQL, C, C++, Java, Javascript, Bash, Matlab, Julia\n\nThe men and women who responded to the survey have given the following software they prepare code in:-\n\nWomen: R Studio, Visual Studio, Notepad++, Jupyter Notebook, Kaggle Notebook, Colab Notebook\n\nMen: R Studio, Visual Studio, Notepad++, Jupyter Notebook, Kaggle Notebook, Colab Notebook, VIM EMACS, Azure Notebook, Paperspace, IBM Watson Studio\n\nThe men and women who responded to the survey have given the following hardware they code in:-\n\nWomen: Cloud computing, and Laptop\n\nMen: Personal computer, Laptop, Cloud computing, and Deep learning workstation\n\nThe men and women who responded to the survey have indicated that they program using the following libraries:-\n\nWomen: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Shiny, Sklearn, Tensorflow, Catboost, Caret, and Tidymodel\n\nMen: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Gplot, Sklearn, Tensorflow, XGBoost, LightGBM, Prophet, and Tidymodel\n\nThe men and women who responded to the survey have indicated that they use the following estimators:-\n\nWomen: Linear regression, Logistic regression, Decision trees, Random forest, Gradient boosting, Bayesian approaches, DNN\u2019s, CNN\u2019s, and Generative Adversarial\n\nMen: Linear regression, Logistic regression, Decision trees, Random forest, Bayesian approach, DNN\u2019s, CNN\u2019s, Evolutionary approach, and Gradient boosting\n\nThe men and women who responded to the survey have indicated they work in the following sectors:-\n\nWomen: Non-profit, Medical\/pharmaceutical, Other\n\nMen: Medical\/pharmaceutical, Shipping\/transport, Retail\/sales, Academics\/education, Government\/public service, and Accounting\/finance\n\nThe men and women who responded to the survey have indicated that the use the following skills to learn new platforms:-\n\nWomen: Udacity, Udemy, Kaggle learn courses, University courses, Coursera, edX, Udemy\n\nMen: Coursera, Kaggle learn courses, Cloud programs, University courses, edX, Udacity, Udemy, Datacamp\n\nThe men and women who responded to the survey indicated that they use the following tools to stay abreast of data science topics:-\n\nWomen: Email\/newsletters, Kaggle notebooks, YouTube, Blogs, Job publications\n\nMen: Email\/newsletters, Kaggle notebooks, YouTube, Blogs Job publications\n\nThe above responses serve as a summary of the data provided by the respondents and the reader will need to refer to the dataframe at the bottom of this EDA to obtain a more precise view of the answers to the questions posed by Kaggle.\n","7eff7b32":"Append dataframes of men and women","1a5738f2":"Import","36ac3722":"The next part of this EDA is women data scientists in the UK","76986826":"This section of the EDA focuses on women data scientists who are in their 60's.","23327109":"Read","46b1a387":"Highest level of education of male data scientists in the UK","8f281e23":"Countries women data scientists reside in","cbb59987":"Ages of women data scientists in the UK","f0ba6b81":"Ages of male data scientists in the UK","b46f1a42":"Gender","11185e4c":"Transpose combi"}}
