Basic sanitation is the last infrastructure sector that has not been liberalized, unlike segments such as telephony and energy.  \n\nThe text provides for bids for the contracting of water and sewage companies, which opens the way for the entry of private initiative in the sector, which will now compete on equal terms with state-owned companies.\n\nBoth public and private companies will have to meet universalization goals, to be achieved by the end of 2033.

Linear regression is used to provide estimates of the population with handwashing facilities at home, as well as the proportion with handwashing facilities where soap and water were observed.\n\nSeparate estimates are made for urban and rural areas, and national estimates are generated as weighted averages of the two, using population data from the most recent report of the United Nations Population Division. The most recent household survey or census available for most countries was typically conducted two to six years ago. \n\nThe JMP (Joint Monitoring Programme) extrapolates regressions for two years beyond the last available data point. Beyond this point the estimates remain unchanged for up to four years unless coverage is below 0.5 per cent or above 99.5 per cent, in which case the line is extended indefinitely.

Janssens, H. L. Rieder-European Respiratory Journal 2008 32: 1415-1416; DOI: 10.1183\/09031936.00078708 \n\nIn 2006, an estimated 9 million new cases of tuberculosis (TB) emerged worldwide 1. Of these, only 1% occurred in the European Union and North America combined, while Africa and South-East Asia contributed >65 per cent. Among the 22 high-burden countries, 17 were in Africa, 16 of which were in the lowest quartile in terms of per capita gross domestic product (GDP). Since 2001, the fight against poverty has been a major theme in the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) \u201cStop TB\u201d strategy. Indeed, poverty \u201cfuels\u201d TB by facilitating transmission through crowded working and living conditions, it may increase the risk of progression to disease through malnutrition, and imposes barriers to accessing health services.\n\nThe World Bank publishes yearly estimates of per capita GDP per country. Similarly, the WHO provides annual estimates for TB incidence for each country by WHO region. Of the 211 WHO member states and 177 countries with reports by the World Bank, there were 171 pairs with information on both GDP and TB. For uniformity of the denominator, United Nations population estimates for 2004 were used to obtain per capita figures for GDP and TB, respectively.\n\nThe choice of the same denominator permitted a direct regression on the numerators (rather than on rates), using population size as a weight. Linear regression on the logarithm of both TB (2004) and GDP (2005) was chosen as the intuitively simplest model. Both unweighted (not shown) and weighted regression gave similar results.\nhttps:\/\/erj.ersjournals.com\/content\/32\/5\/1415","b5e1cf87":"Das War's, Kaggle Notebook Runner: Mar\u00edlia Prata  @mpwolke "}}
