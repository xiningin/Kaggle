Here's your coding interview problem for today.\n\nThis problem was asked by Microsoft.\n\nCompute the running median of a sequence of numbers. That is, given a stream of numbers, print out the median of the list so far on each new element.\n\nRecall that the median of an even-numbered list is the average of the two middle numbers.\n\nFor example, given the sequence [2, 1, 5, 7, 2, 0, 5], your algorithm should print out:\n\n2\n1.5\n2\n3.5\n2\n2\n2"}}
