clearly wrong, because both groups have cards with new merchant counts being 1. Still, we can clearly see higher new merchant count being a huge factor contributing to nonzero loyalty score. So my guess wasn't completely irrelevant.\n\nFinally let's also try to see the relationship between new merchant count and loyalty score ","5632b676":"Very interesting, it looks like a normal distribution but it's tricky to interpret. It seems to indicate that the loyalty score's variance will reduce as the number of merchants increases (which makes a lot of sense), but the expectation of the score doesn't necessarily increase (even slightly negatively correlated from the way it seems). \n\nOne explanation could be that some people maybe using the payment service a lot, and they discover a lot of underlying problems (but they can't stop using it for some reason, maybe it's too hard to swtich, maybe there's no other alternative, maybe they are lazy, whatever) which cause the loyalty drop. Nonetheless, aggregation of the new\/hist transactions separately and trying to find some difference between the two seem to be a good direction when doing feature engineering.","d911babf":"Now let's see if the assumption is true - that card holders continuously use the service in new merchants should tend to have higher loyalty scores.","7c42d439":"The goal is to see if it's more likely to have a higher loyalty score if the card holder keeps using the payment system in the new transaction files in new merchants, because if they do and intuitively it means they like the service.","ed8449bb":"Now this doesn't make sense - the original expectation is for scores_in_new to be in general > scores_not_in_new, but the mean of scores_in_new is actually smaller. Let's plot the data.","3155dd91":"Now we see an interesting pattern. For the card holders which appear in both hist and new transaction history, there's a gap in \"target=0\", whereas for the other group (card holder not appeared in new transaction history), there's a huge spike in target=0. \n\nLet's understand this more quantitatively.","5f2dfd49":"The difference is really big. 7% in the disppearing group have 0 score, whereas 0.06% in overlap group has 0 score. This leads to my guess that:\n1. loyalty score = 0 is likely a default value, which we assign when there's not enough information for us to determine the loyalty score\n2. And as long as we have **some** information, there loyalty score will very rarely become 0 (it might be very small value but really rarely 0)","23cad10c":"It seems the spliting of train and test are solely based on card id hashing. Both appear 100% in historical transactions and both have some missing entries in the new transaction file meaning they didn't use it in new merchants.","ca5532ed":"It seems we have outliers, let's try removing them","9151f0ab":"I'm also intrigued by where those 117 come from - do we apply some kind of thresholds like, on the number of new merchants being developed in new transaction?"}}
