Instead of assuming that the three classes are evenly distrubuted (i.e., 1\/3,1\/3,1\/3), we can check the prior probability of the three classes in gap_test which we will us as training set. We can then use the validation set to get a realistic idea how this baseline would perform on the test set.\n\nIn addtion, we also perform an analysis of the difference in performance of female and male pronouns.
