we can deduce from the above figure that we have a pretty wide deviation in the neutral sentiment, which is always present in our lyrics, and on average, it represents half of the sentiment of the lyric, i.e., no lyric is mainly negative or positive according to the Vaders lexicon.\nAlso, on average, the number one songs tend to be more positive than negative.","b4f79dbf":"**Observation**: After decomposing both the positive and negative sentiments using a ten-year period, we can see a rising trend in negativity in the rank one lyrics and previous positivity trend that peaked in 1978 and declined from there.","88660483":"To estimate the probability of a song being \"outstanding,\" i.e., be the number one most appeared song in its years and have a significant difference between the second rank, we will use Bayesian inference.\nWe will estimate our prior probability for a sing being \"outstanding,\" using a uniform prior as we do not have any prior knowledge or belief regarding such songs' rate.\nWe define $$\\Theta \\sim Uniform(0,1)$$ to be prior for the P parameter that we will sample.\nThe process of a song being \"outstanding\" can be modeled by using a Bernoulli distribution with a parameter sampled from our uniform prior, i.e., $$Outstanding \\sim Ber(\\Theta)$$\n","f4b135f4":"**Note**: Above the lyrics for the rank one songs were manually added to perform sentiment analysis.","162c59f3":"<a id=\"1\"><\/a>\n\n<h1 style=\"background-color:orange;font-family:newtimeroman;font-size:170%;text-align:center;border-radius: 15px 50px;\">Artist

Analysis<\/h1>\n","30b74807":"**Observation**: It seems that we do not have any significant autocorrelation or partial autocorrelation between any of our lags, with an exception for a single relatively small correlation between the positive sentiment and its lag 1.","1f965fa6":"**Observation**: After looking at the above figure and observing the spikes in the differences between the first rank and the second rank, we defined a song as being outstandingly impactful by asking is it above the average difference plus one standard deviation.\nThe above table shows the rank one song names and the year they held a significant difference from rank two.\nNote that the magnitude of difference between rank one song and rank two songs is significantly larger on average than between rank two and three.\nInterestingly, if we look carefully at the years, we can see that these unique songs are distributed relatively uniformly around our timeline, and there is no particular period where more songs matched our definition. \n","7457f9a8":"<a id=\"1\"><\/a>\n\n<h1 style=\"background-color:orange;font-family:newtimeroman;font-size:250%;text-align:center;border-radius: 15px 50px;\">Libraires

applied to analyze the artists.\nInterestingly, observing outstandingly famous artists in a particular year i.e., having a number of appearances which is above the average plus one standard deviation, is much rarer.\nSo rare that only six artists ever achieved such a position.\nAnother important observation is that those rare artists' years seem to become more frequent as we move towards the present.","92353ecb":"<a id=\"1\"><\/a>\n\n<h1 style=\"background-color:orange;font-family:newtimeroman;font-size:170%;text-align:center;border-radius: 15px 50px;\">Song

sampling from our posterior space using Metropolis MCMC we see that our posterior distribution is quite wide due to the small number of observations, answering our hypothesis with a wide range of possible value of $\\Theta$.\nStill, we can say with high confidence that the probability of a random song from the number one list being \"outstanding\" is between 0.07 to 0.27, centered around 0.17.","b6ed5f3f":"**Observation**: When looking at the number of times a song appeared on the Billboard top 100 list in a particular year, we can deduce that the most impactful and popular song has the largest number of appearances.\nIn the figure above, we can observe two important points; the first is the trend starting roughly around 1985 where the number 1 song, i.e., the one with the most appearances, is becoming more and more obsolete with time, meaning we each year we the listeners prefer a particular song and our preference stays stationary over the list posted through the year.\nAnd the second observation which we will further analyze is the difference between the ranks, i.e., how different are the number 1,2 and 3 places in terms of appearances, a small assumption to we make goes as following; We consider a song to be outstandingly popular and catchy in the case where the difference between the 1 and 2\/3 rank is at its highest.\n","75b22155":"Observation: In the above figure shown the cosine similarity between the lyrics of each consecutive two years.\nOur point of interest is seeing if there are any periods on our timeline in which the song lyrics were significantly different, and we indeed see such behavior.\nThe two periods with the most significant deviation between consecutive years are colored in green and orange in the figure.\n","33911815":"**Observation**: The above cluster map shows the segmentation of the song lyrics into clusters based on the distances between them, and we see that although there is no segmentation into a large cluster, there are many similar songs that arise questions like, how original are the lyrics of the most popular song in the Billboard top 100 and how much did our taste in music changed in 63 years? Is there some formation for the perfect catchy song?","170944ae":"<a id=\"1\"><\/a>\n\n<h1 style=\"background-color:orange;font-family:newtimeroman;font-size:250%;text-align:center;border-radius: 15px 50px;\">Exploratory Data Analysis<\/h1>\n","3bdc1e29":"**Note**: Above is a small segment of our test for sentiment stationarity over our timeline, and it seems that the mean and standard deviation in all three of our partitions has no significant difference, which may point to a non-constant mean\/variance."}}
