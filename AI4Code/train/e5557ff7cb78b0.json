Negative Tweets\n\nWe'll filter out the negative tweets after the sentiment analysis and try to see if this corresponds to a significatly lower closing prices on days where the volume of negative

Result\nSince the chart shows that number the share price of amazon had kept on increasing , inspite of having at least 1 negative tweet per day, there isin't a considerable differnce between opening

The most important factor could be the thoughts of the public. In this task, you are responsible to analyze the effect of public opinion about a company on that company's market values. In this notebook we will try to understand whether negative tweets about companie affect their market prices."}}
