But they\u2019re also some of the brightest objects in the entire known universe. And the reason is, because when you tend to get too close to a black hole, if you\u2019re a planet or a star cloud of gas, you get whipped around into a really fast orbit going nearly the speed of light, heated up to millions of degrees and shining out in bright ultraviolet, X-ray, radio, just really bright, bright sources of light coming from not the black hole itself, but from the effect that it has on anyone who gets too close to it. So that\u2019s why, that\u2019s how we see them. That\u2019s how we study them. For the most part.\"\n\n\"One in 1,000 stars becomes a black hole at the end of its life. And if you think about the fact that we have over 100 billion stars in the Milky Way, you do the math and you end up with over 100 million black holes floating around the Milky Way. And we\u2019ve seen 40 of them. So that leaves 99,999,000 and change that we\u2019ve never even detected, and they\u2019re just going to be sprinkled throughout the, the Milky Way, just like all the stars. And again, do a little bit of math, and the chances are, that there\u2019s a black hole that we\u2019ve never even seen within only, say, 25 light-years of the Earth. I mean, it doesn\u2019t pose any immediate risk.

LIGO  A Gravitational-Wave Interferometer<\/font>\n\n\n\"LIGO scientists have defined four categories of gravitational waves based on what generates them: Continuous, Compact Binary Inspiral, Stochastic, and Burst. Each category of objects generates a unique or characteristic set of signal that LIGO's interferometers can sense, and that researchers can look for in LIGO\u2019s data. \"\n\n<font color=\"#EC7063\">CONTINUOUS GRAVITATIONAL WAVES<\/font>\n\n\n\"Continuous gravitational waves are thought to be produced by a single spinning massive object like a neutron star. Any bumps on or imperfections in the spherical shape of this star will generate gravitational waves as it spins. If the spin-rate of the star stays constant, so too are the gravitational waves it emits. That is, the gravitational wave is continuously the same frequency and amplitude (like a singer holding a single note). That's why these are called \u201cContinuous Gravitational Waves\u201d.\"\n\n\n<font color=\"#EC7063\">COMPACT BINARY INSPIRAL GRAVITATIONAL WAVES<\/font>\n\n\n\"The next class of gravitational waves LIGO is hunting for is Compact Binary Inspiral gravitational waves. So far, all of the objects LIGO has detected fall into this category. Compact binary inspiral gravitational waves are produced by orbiting pairs of massive and dense (\"compact\") objects like white dwarf stars, black holes, and neutron stars. There are three subclasses of \"compact binary\" systems in this category of gravitational-wave generators:\"\n\n\"Binary Neutron Star (BNS);; Binary Black Hole (BBH);; Neutron Star-Black Hole Binary (NSBH).\"\n\n\"Each binary pair creates a unique pattern of gravitational waves, but the mechanism of wave-generation is the same across all three. It is called \"inspiral\".\n\n\"Inspiral occurs over millions of years as pairs of dense compact objects revolve around each other. As they orbit, they emit gravitational waves that carry away some of the system's orbital energy. As a result, over eons, the objects orbit closer and closer together. Unfortunately, moving closer causes them to orbit each other faster, which causes them to emit stronger gravitational waves, which causes them to lose more orbital energy, inch ever closer, orbit faster, lose more energy, move closer, orbit faster\u2026 etc. The objects are doomed, inescapably locked in a runaway accelerating spiraling embrace.\"\n\n\n<font color=\"#EC7063\">STOCHASTIC GRAVITATIONAL WAVES<\/font>\n\n\n\"Astronomers predict that there are so few significant sources of continuous or binary inspiral gravitational waves in the Universe that LIGO doesn't worry about the possibility of more than one passing by Earth at the same time (producing confusing signals in the detectors). However, we do presume that many small gravitational waves are passing by from all over the Universe all the time, and that they are mixed together at random. These small waves from every direction make up what is called a \u201cStochastic Signal\u201d, so called because the word, 'stochastic' means having a random pattern that may be analyzed statistically but not predicted precisely. These will be the smallest and most difficult gravitational waves to detect, but it is possible that at least part of this stochastic signal may originate from the Big Bang. Detecting relic gravitational waves from the Big Bang will allow us to see farther back into the history of the Universe than ever before.\"\n\n<font color=\"#EC7063\">BURST GRAVITATIONAL WAVES<\/font>\n\n\n\"The search for 'burst gravitational waves' is truly a search for the unexpected\u2014both because LIGO has yet to detect them, and because there are still so many unknowns that we really don\u2019t know what to expect! For example, sometimes we don\u2019t know enough about the physics of a system to predict how gravitational waves from that source will appear.\n\nWe also expect to detect gravitational waves from systems we never knew about before. To search for these kinds of gravitational waves, we cannot assume that they will have well-defined properties like those of continuous and compact binary inspiral waves. This means we cannot restrict our analyses to searching only for the signatures of gravitational waves that scientists have predicted.\n\nSearching for burst gravitational waves requires being utterly open-minded. For these kinds of gravitational waves, scientists must recognize a pattern of signals even when such a pattern has not been modeled (what we think a signal may look like) before. If you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re looking for, it\u2019s really hard to find it. While this makes searching for burst gravitational waves difficult, detecting them has the greatest potential to reveal revolutionary information about the Universe.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/www.ligo.caltech.edu\/page\/gw-sources"}}
