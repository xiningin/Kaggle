It explores the hidden relationships between units by taking into account the simultaneous and frequent realization criteria of the units in the database. That is to say, its aim is to identify relations between products or variables in a dataset. The main idea is to find out which products often go together or with what frequency, etc. Association Rules are often preferred in terms of applicability in almost every field such as promotion analysis, market basket analysis, cross-marketing, layout designs, and catalog. Especially, it is often utilized in market basket analysis.\n*     In association rules, the most important event is rule extraction. In the association rules model, there is no initial research problem as in other data mining models. With the help of Minimum Support Value and Minimum Confidence Value, researcher generated the rules from the data, and as a result, valid and reliable rules are tried to be reached. Some association rules algorithms are used for fast and reliable pattern recognition. Apriori algorithm is generally preferred in association rules studies. Agrawal and Srikant developed apriori algorithm, is a level-wise, breadth-first algorithm. In this study, I describe an implementation of the well-known apriori algorithm for the induction of association rules.","db27d9a1":"# Import Some Necessary Libraries","bd0559f2":"![](http:\/\/)![image.png](attachment:image.png)"}}
