Perhaps a taxi transporting some goods or an administration error? The latter seems not the case as the `fare_amount` is also significantly lower.\n\nInstead of looking to the `fare_amount` using the 'fare per mile' also provides some insights.","b3184dbc":"The maximum fare \\$USD\/mile seem to be very high. This could be due to wrong distance or fare data. On the other hand, let's analyse this somewhat further. In general taxi fare is calculate by\n\n$$\ny_{fare} = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1 \\cdot x_{distance} + \\theta_2 \\cdot x_{duration}\n$$\n\nwith $\\theta_0$ the starting tariff, $x_{distance}$ the distance travelled and $x_{duration}$ the duration of the trip. If we rewrite this we get an expression for the fare per distance:\n\n$$\n\\frac{y_{fare}}{x_{distance}} = \\frac{\\theta_0}{x_{distance}} + \\theta_1 + \\theta_2 \\cdot \\frac{x_{duration}}{ x_{distance}}\n$$\n\nLet's further assume for the shorter trips that $x_{distance} = c \\cdot x_{duration}$ with $c$ the average speed, then we get\n\n$$\n\\frac{y_{fare}}{x_{distance}} = \\frac{\\theta_0}{x_{distance}} + \\theta_1 + \\frac{\\theta_2}{c} \\cdot \\frac{x_{duration}}{x_{duration}} = \\frac{\\theta_0}{x_{distance}} + \\theta_1'\n$$\n\nwith $\\theta_1' = \\theta_1 + \\theta_2 \/ c$.\n\nConclusion: the fare per distance is proportional to $1\/\\text{distance_mile}$. Let's plot the data and a graph.\n","0616aec2":"For a baseline model I use a linear regression model.","8c42e675":"So, even for trips with the same length we see the influence of the direction on the fare amount. The notebook of Oliver (https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/ojones3\/feature-engineering-corrected-manhattan-distance) explains the difference in calculating the distance of a trip using Euclidean vs Manhattan distance measure. The distance calculated in this notebook is the direct point-to-point distance. This is not the true distance of the trip. Using the Manhattan distance gives a better approximation *if* the streets are aligned to the vertical and horizontal axis. That is, if we turn the streets 60 degrees. \n\nThis is the reason that the average fare for direction=60 or -120 is the lowest, as the distance at these angles is the true distance (driving down a street without turns). If the direction is different from 60 or -120 degrees, this means that the distance of the trip in reality is larger, so a higher fare amount.","5805a108":"It can be clearly seen that the fare $USD\/mile varies over the years and over the hours. \n\nTo investigate this further I used Google map to calculate the expected duration of two trips:\n\n- Trip 1 : from Museum of the City of New York to Beacon Theatre, 4.5km, not leaving Manhatten\n- Trip 2 : from Times Squared to Maria Hermandez Park, 12km, leaving Times Squared via Queens Midtown Tunnel (Toll road)\n\nBelow are the data and graphs. I do see the same type of graph. So, amount of traffic determines the duration of the trip and thus the fare. While the amount of traffic depends on the hour of the day.","989ff69c":"In the histogram of the `fare_amount` there are some small spikes between \\$40 and \\$60. This could indicate some fixed fare price (e.g. to\/from airport). This will be explored further below.","ecc3f29d":"## Location data\n\nAs we're dealing with location data, I want to plot the coordinates on a map. This gives a better view of the data. For this, I use the following website:\n\n- Easy to use map and GPS tool: https:\/\/www.gps-coordinates.net\/ \n- Calculate distance between locations: https:\/\/www.travelmath.com\/flying-distance\/\n- Open street map to grab using bouding box a map: https:\/\/www.openstreetmap.org\/export#map=8\/52.154\/5.295\n\nNew York city coordinates are (https:\/\/www.travelmath.com\/cities\/New+York,+NY):\n\n- longitude = -74.0063889\n- lattitude = 40.7141667\n\nI define a bounding box of interest by [long_min, long_max, latt_min, latt_max] using the minimum and maximum coordinates from the testset.

This is one aspect I would guess a more advanced model (deep learning NN) would improve upon compared to a linear model.\n\n[30\/07\/2018] An other reason why the spread for smaller distances is larger could be due to slow traffic at rush hours.
