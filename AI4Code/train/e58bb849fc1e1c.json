It supports all common barcode symbologies as well as many obscure ones, is actively maintained, and is available under the MIT license.\n\n2. treepoem stands out by the sheer number of supported symbologies and symbology variants. The way this feat is achieved, however, brings with it a few possible downsides.\n\n3. The Python package treepoem is a wrapper around the Postscript program BWIPP.\n\n4. treepoem invokes Postscript using subprocess.Popen() meaning that Postscript must already be installed and subprocess available. This may be a problem if you are trying to generate barcode images in a shared environment such as a notebook server, to name just one example. In addition, treepoem requires the Pillow package for producing image file format.\n\nIf you are not affected by any of these potential stumbling blocks, then treepoem is refreshingly easy to use.\n\n#### It\u2019s my recommendation for anyone who wants to work with many symbologies to go with treepoem.","33e1ec29":"### Below is the QR Code to my Website:\n\nScan and see the magic!!!"}}
