The values of the j-th feature were permuted among the training data and the out-of-bag error was again computed on this perturbed dataset. The importance score for the j-th feature is computed by averaging the difference in out-of-bag error before and after the permutation over all trees. The score is normalized by the standard deviation of these differences.\n\n\nFeatures which produce large values for this score are ranked as more important than features which produce small values.

Advantages and disadvantages of Random Forest algorithm** <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"3\"><\/a>\n\n[Table of Contents](#0.1)\n\n\nThe advantages of Random forest algorithm are as follows:-\n\n\n1.\tRandom forest algorithm can be used to solve both classification and regression problems.\n2.\tIt is considered as very accurate and robust model because it uses large number of decision-trees to make predictions.\n3.\tRandom forests takes the average of all the predictions made by the decision-trees, which cancels out the biases. So, it does not suffer from the overfitting problem. \n4.\tRandom forest classifier can handle the missing values. There are two ways to handle the missing values. First is to use median values to replace continuous variables and second is to compute the proximity-weighted average of missing values.\n5.\tRandom forest classifier can be used for feature selection. It means selecting the most important features out of the available features from the training dataset.\n\n\nThe disadvantages of Random Forest algorithm are listed below:-\n\n\n1.\tThe biggest disadvantage of random forests is its computational complexity. Random forests is very slow in making predictions because large number of decision-trees are used to make predictions. All the trees in the forest have to make a prediction for the same input and then perform voting on it. So, it is a time-consuming process.\n2.\tThe model is difficult to interpret as compared to a decision-tree, where we can easily make a prediction as compared to a decision-tree.\n","e8a7d85d":"# **20.
