TIn connection with the above two diagrams that separate partner from customers without partner, it can be drawn that this rule is not related to whether the customer has partne. Thus, as long as we increase the TotalCharges of customer, customers will be able to retain customers if they are accustomed to our products. At the same time, when retaining customers, the TotalCharges of customers is higher, so the benefits to the company will double. Therefore, we can launch a strategy of giving customers more preferential services in the early stage service, so as to \"suck\" customers and let customers get used to the products of the company.","eea248dd":"The column chart shows that the customers who pay the \"Electronic check\" in the 7032 customer samples are much more likely to be divorced.

However, as we can see, their probability of disengagement is higher than that of young citizens.\nThe numbers make sense: older people spend more time at home because they are retired or less stressed or relaxed, so they consume more television, which leads to more and more expensive meals.\nTherefore, we can introduce more preferential policies for the elderly residents, because their consumption level is higher, if this strategy works, it will greatly enhance the company's income.","0afd6b8f":"Look at the general distribution of MonthlyCharges."}}
