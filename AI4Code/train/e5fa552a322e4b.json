Exercise\n\n## The Data\n\nWe will be using a subset of the LendingClub DataSet obtained from Kaggle: https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/wordsforthewise\/lending-club\n\nLendingClub is a US peer-to-peer lending company, headquartered in San Francisco, California.[3] It was the first peer-to-peer lender to register its offerings as securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and to offer loan trading on a secondary market. LendingClub is the world's largest peer-to-peer lending platform.\n\n### Our Goal\n\nGiven historical data on loans given out with information on whether or not the borrower defaulted (charge-off), can we build a model thatcan predict wether or nor a borrower will pay back their loan? This way in the future when we get a new potential customer we can assess whether or not they are likely to pay back the loan. Keep in mind classification metrics when evaluating the performance of your model!\n\nThe \"loan_status\" column contains our label.\n\n### Data Overview\n----\n-----\nThere are many LendingClub data sets on Kaggle. Here is the information on this particular data set:\n\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th><\/th>\n      <th>LoanStatNew<\/th>\n      <th>Description<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0<\/th>\n      <td>loan_amnt<\/td>\n      <td>The listed amount of the loan applied for by the borrower.
