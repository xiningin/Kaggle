Majority of the points are clustered at the lower hand left corner grid, so the transfer\n- The slopes of the linear regression lines are steepest in the order of LaLiga, Premier League and Serie A. This shows us that for one increment of market value of a player, it is more expensive to purchase a player from LaLiga than Premier League","729e1b81":"The league that spent the most money, on average, to buy players for the past 13 years or so was Spanish LaLiga and British Premiere League. One unexpected league that was ranked 5th place was the Super League of Greece which is less known to global soccer fans. But it has definitely spent a lot of money bringing expensive players to the league!","54dd049d":"- We can observe the three outliers (the three strands of data whose transfer fee are way higher than the market value and also way up in the graph compared to the cluster of strands below) let's look at which players they are\n- Most strands seem to be clustered around at the bottom with the green(Serie A) and orange(Premier League) having been valued at slightly higher market value and transferred for higher fees than LaLiga players","b4f4c23f":"- Correlation between market value and transfer fee is very high. This means the more expensive the player is evaluated in the market, the more likely it is going to be sold at a expensive price.\n- The correlation value betwen age and transfer free is negative although the strenght of the correlation isn't that strong. This at least suggests that the older the age, the less value it has in the market. Of course, I expect the returns to age is a reversed bell shaped curve because as a player gets older, he gets more experience and hence becomes more valuable as a player. But after a certain threshold, the player is considered to be old and is valued lowly in the market.","af2c3ad4":"Those three outlier players were the big shots!

But Ligue1, the top division of French men's soccer league, is topping the list. However, we can see there were only two trades that happened (as we can see from the \"count\" column with the number 2) but the average of those two trades were significant enough to make Ligue1 rank 1st for this list.
