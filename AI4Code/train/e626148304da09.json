As part of the innate immune defense, the nasal mucosa includes receptors for the identification of pathogenic structures of microorganisms, fungi and viruses. \n\nFurther mechanisms are chemical components such as antimicrobial peptides and cellular components such as neutrophil granulocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells. Although pathogens can be distinguished from non-pathogens, innate immunity is relatively unspecific compared to the adaptive immune response. The recognition of pathogens is achieved by pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) on the mucosal surface, which were first described by Charles Janeway Jr. PRRs can be divided into three large subunits, namely the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), retinoic acid-inducible gene (RIG)-I-like receptors (RLRs) and nucleotide-binding oligomerisation domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs).\n\nNLRs (NOD-like receptors) are intracellular PRRs that induce an immune response after the detection of PAMPs(Pathogen-associated molecular patterns) or damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). The activation of NLRs shows different functions, which can be divided into four main categories: inflammasome formation, signaling transduction, transcription activation, and autophagy. In humans, 22 NLRs are known, and the association malfunction with human diseases reflect their vital role in host defense.https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC6916682\/","d066cc44":"#ACE2 as a receptor for cellular entry\n\nIn symptomatic patients, nasal swabs have yielded higher viral loads than throat swabs. The same distribution was observed in an asymptomatic patient, implicating the nasal epithelium as a portal for initial infection and transmission. Cellular entry of coronaviruses depends on the binding of the spike (S) protein to a specific cellular receptor and subsequent S protein priming by cellular proteases. Similarly to SARS-CoV5,6, SARS-CoV-2 employs ACE2 as a receptor for cellular entry.\n\nThe binding affinity of the S protein and ACE2 was found to be a major determinant of SARS-CoV replication rate and disease severity,.

Typically, claudins have a unique secondary protein structure: four transmembrane (TM) domains, N- and C-terminal domains aligned to the cytosol, two extracellular domains, and a short intracellular loop.\n\nFunctionally, the main task of the claudins is the formation of the paracellular TJ barrier and therefore the key position with regard to the permeability of individual epithelia. In addition, claudins are categorized according to their abilities, ie, formation of paracellular channels (pore-forming) and restriction of paracellular permeability (sealing claudins).\n\nThis emphasizes the different characteristics of the individual claudin family members with regard to their barrier properties. Some claudin subtypes, such as claudin-3, \u22124, \u22125, and \u22128, are mainly detectable in impermeable epithelial cells.\n\nOther claudin species, such as claudin-2, are found in permeable epithelia like the surface epithelium of duodenum, ileum and jejunum.

It is the first barrier against continuously inhaled substances such as pathogens and allergens.\n\nAn important intrinsic defense system is the mucociliary clearance of the nasal cavity. Ciliary beat in a well-orchestrated and coordinated manner, which results in a wave motion leading to a successful elimination of foreign bodies. The respiratory epithelium contains about 200 cilia per cell. These have nine peripheral microtubule pairs that surround a central microtubule pair, which leads to the well-known \u201c9+2\u201d arrangement of microtubules.\n\nChronic inflammation or locally applied medication can have negative effects on epithelium functions, which are associated with the disturbed or missing ciliary activity, epithelial metaplasia leading to an impaired mucociliary clearance. Thus, the integrity of the nasal protective mechanisms may be further compromised.\n\nOther possible etiologic factors for nasal epithelia metaplasia are cigarette smoke, ozone, and heavy metals. Chronic inflammation such as chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) or asthma leads to epithelial damage resulting in increased paracellular permeability, impaired epithelial repair mechanisms and inflammation. \n\nHistologically, the respiratory epithelium changes into a hypersecretory mucus state with increased proliferation rates of goblet cells, hypertrophy of submucosal glands, basement membrane thickening, hypertrophy of smooth muscles, and a thick layer of mucus on the apical surface.https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC6916682\/","4a91c90b":"#Current Understanding of Nasal Epithelial Cell Mis-Differentiation\n\nAuthors: Agmal Scherzad, Rudolf Hagen, and Stephan Hackenberg - J Inflamm Res. 2019; 12: 309\u2013317.\nPublished online 2019 Dec 13. doi: 10.2147\/JIR.S180853\n\nThe functional role of the respiratory epithelium is to generate a physical barrier.

Co-expression in other barrier surface tissues could also suggest further investigation into alternative transmission routes. \n\nFor example, the co-expression in esophagus, ileum and colon could explain viral fecal shedding observed clinically, with implications for potential fecal\u2013oral transmission, whereas the co-expression in superficial conjunctival cells could explain an ocular phenotype observed in a small portion of COVID-19 patients with the potential of spread through the nasolacrimal duct\n\nMoreover, as SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus, its release does not require cell lysis. Thus, the virus might exploit existing secretory pathways in nasal goblet cells sustained at a presymptomatic stage. These discoveries could have translational implications. For example, given that nasal carriage is likely to be a key feature of transmission, drugs\/vaccines administered intranasally could be highly effective in limiting spread.\n.https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41591-020-0868-6#citeas","7dc35e00":"#ACE2 (Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) and TMPRSS2 (Transmembrane protease, serine 2).\n\nACE2 and TMPRSS2 (Transmembrane protease, serine 2) have been detected in both nasal and bronchial epithelium by immunohistochemistry.
