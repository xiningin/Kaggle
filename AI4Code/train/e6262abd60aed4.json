From here on out, we will have to properly encode our data before imputing the missing values.

It is basic, and simple, and probably useless for this particular competition (spoiler: it kind of is). But I think the process taught me a lot, and should be useful in real word datasets!\n\nIn this notebook I plan to analyze the missing data in our dataset. In the real world we typically have very messy data, and this data can be lost when aquiring, or deleted accidentally afterwards. The workflow will be:\n\n1. Check for missing values (are they NaN? are they some other representation for NULL, if so, convert these to null values).\n2. Analyze the amount of missing values, and the type.\n3. Either delete, or impute these values.\n4. Evaluate and compare the performance of each imputed option.\n\nThis notebook will cover the first 2 steps in this process using the missingno python library.  Intuitively, I expect this data to be completely random with regards to missing values, but that is an assumption!\n\nWe will concatenate our training and test sets for now (simply for analysis). And we will drop the target column, assuming our training set is complete.\n","113e5e22":"The heatmap shows no correlations, and a dendrogram can be done as well (but... I think we can see where this is heading). Any closely correlated features will be seen \"close to each other\" on leaves.
