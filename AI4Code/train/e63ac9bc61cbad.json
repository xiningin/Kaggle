the gradient can\u2019t be determined, which is necessary for the model to improve during training)\n\nA quick look at the PyTorch docs that yields the cost function: [cross_entropy](https:\/\/pytorch.org\/docs\/stable\/nn.functional.html#cross-entropy).\n\n- `validation_step` - Because an accuracy metric can\u2019t be used while training the model, doesn\u2019t mean it shouldn\u2019t be implemented! Accuracy in this case would be measured by a threshold, and counted if the difference between the model\u2019s prediction and the actual label is lower than that threshold.\n- `validation_epoch_end` - We want to track the validation losses\/accuracies and train losses after each epoch, and every time we do so we have to make sure the gradient is not being tracked.\n- `epoch_end` - We also want to print validation losses\/accuracies, train losses and learning rate too because we are using learning rate scheduler (which will change the learning rate after every batch of training) after each epoch.\n\nWe also define an `accuracy` function which calculates the overall accuracy of the model on an entire batch of outputs, so that we can use it as a metric in `fit_one_cycle`","18f36984":"#### Visualizing the above information on a graph","c0ad4fb3":"- `DataLoader` is a subclass which comes from `torch.utils.data`.

It is heplful so that batches between epochs do not look alike. Doing so will eventually make our model more robust.\n\n- `num_workers`, denotes the number of processes that generate batches in parallel.

The algorithm takes the first 100 samples (from 1st to 100th) from the training dataset and trains the network.

There are many strategies for varying the learning rate during training, and the one we\u2019ll use is called the *\u201cOne Cycle Learning Rate Policy\u201d*, which involves starting with a low learning rate, gradually increasing it batch-by-batch to a high learning rate for about 30% of epochs, then gradually decreasing it to a very low value for the remaining epochs.\n\n- **Weight Decay**: We also use weight decay, which is a regularization technique which prevents the weights from becoming too large by adding an additional term to the loss function. \n\n- **Gradient Clipping**: Apart from the layer weights and outputs, it also helpful to limit the values of gradients to a small range to prevent undesirable changes in parameters due to large gradient values. This simple yet effective technique is called gradient clipping.\n\nWe'll also record the learning rate used for each batch.","ccfb95a8":"Before we train the model, Let\u2019s define a utility functionan `evaluate` function, which will perform the validation phase, and a `fit_one_cycle` function which will perform the entire training process.
