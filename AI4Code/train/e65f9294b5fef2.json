The severity of the condition is variable. Pneumonia is usually caused by infection with viruses or bacteria and less commonly by other microorganisms, certain medications or conditions such as autoimmune diseases.Risk factors include cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, diabetes, heart failure, a history of smoking, a poor ability to cough such as following a stroke and a weak immune system. Diagnosis is often based on symptoms and physical examination. Chest X-ray, blood tests, and culture of the sputum may help confirm the diagnosis.The disease may be classified by where it was acquired, such as community- or hospital-acquired or healthcare-associated pneumonia.**\n![image.png](attachment:image.png)","83a51dfb":"**Previewing the images of both the classes**","7e329941":"**Some of the Correctly Predicted Classes**","15fb47a6":"# Data Visualization & Preprocessing","7800d7d6":"**The data seems imbalanced .

All chest X-ray imaging was performed as part of patients\u2019 routine clinical care.\nFor the analysis of chest x-ray images, all chest radiographs were initially screened for quality control by removing all low quality or unreadable scans. The diagnoses for the images were then graded by two expert physicians before being cleared for training the AI system. In order to account for any grading errors, the evaluation set was also checked by a third expert.**","bcd0c023":"**Some of the Incorrectly Predicted Classes**","9ac7957f":"# Data Augmentation\n**In order to avoid overfitting problem, we need to expand artificially our dataset. We can make your existing dataset even larger. The idea is to alter the training data with small transformations to reproduce the variations.\nApproaches that alter the training data in ways that change the array representation while keeping the label the same are known as data augmentation techniques. Some popular augmentations people use are grayscales, horizontal flips, vertical flips, random crops, color jitters, translations, rotations, and much more.\nBy applying just a couple of these transformations to our training data, we can easily double or triple the number of training examples and create a very robust model.**","a455c3c8":"# Loading the Dataset","4a574249":"For the data augmentation, i choosed to :\n1.

Randomly shift images vertically by 10% of the height \n5. Randomly flip images horizontally.\nOnce our model is ready, we fit the training dataset."}}
