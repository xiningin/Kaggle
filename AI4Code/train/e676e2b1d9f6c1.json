You do so using the fit_generator method, the equivalent of fit for data generators like this one. It expects as its first argument a Python generator that will yield batches of inputs and targets indefinitely, like this one does. Because the data is being generated endlessly, the Keras model needs to know how many samples to draw from the generator before declaring an epoch over. This is the role of the steps_per_epoch argument: after having drawn steps_per_epoch batches from the generator\u2014that is, after having run for steps_per_epoch gradient descent steps\u2014the fitting process will go to the next epoch. \n\nJust remember it is nothing but the number of batches and batch size is the number of samples in the batches. The relationship actually goes as train_length \/\/ batch_size\n\nIn this case, batches are 20 samples, so it will take 100 batches until you see your target of 2,000 samples.\n\nWhen using fit_generator, you can pass a validation_data argument, much as with the fit method. It\u2019s important to note that this argument is allowed to be a data generator, but it could also be a tuple of Numpy arrays. If you pass a generator as validation_data, then this generator is expected to yield batches of validation data endlessly; thus you should also specify the validation_steps argument, which tells the process how many batches to draw from the validation generator for evaluation. ","59405c50":"Now lets check the length of the dat if they are being properly transferred.","2f887e21":"Okay Now we have the required dataset. Now I will start with the actual chapter. And before doing that I will actual save the version because saving the file commits the file in kaggle\/working.

How ? \nIf you know unix you know how.","8a9a8397":"Now go to console opnce again and then do a 'cd ..'","079a9c04":"# Data preprocessing\n\nAs you know by now, data should be formatted into appropriately preprocessed floatingpoint tensors before being fed into the network. Currently, the data sits on a drive as JPG files, so the steps for getting it into the network are roughly as follows:\n1.  Read the picture files.\n2.  Decode the JPEG content to RGB grids of pixels.\n3.  Convert these into floating-point tensors.\n4.  Rescale the pixel values (between 0 and 255) to the [0, 1] interval (as you know, neural networks prefer to deal with small input values).\n\n\nIt may seem a bit daunting, but fortunately Keras has utilities to take care of these steps automatically. Keras has a module with image-processing helper tools, located at keras.preprocessing.image. In particular, it contains the class ImageDataGenerator, which lets you quickly set up Python generators that can automatically turn image files on disk into batches of preprocessed tensors. This is what you\u2019ll use here. ","9f3b10cf":"These plots are characteristic of overfitting. The training accuracy increases linearly over time, until it reaches nearly 100%, whereas the validation accuracy stalls at 70\u201372%. The validation loss reaches its minimum after only five epochs and then stalls, whereas the training loss keeps decreasing linearly until it reaches nearly 0. Because you have relatively few training samples (2,000), overfitting will be your number-one concern. You already know about a number of techniques that can help mitigate overfitting, such as dropout and weight decay (L2 regularization). We\u2019re now going to work with a new one, specific to computer vision and used almost universally when processing images with deep-learning models: data augmentation. ","0a630c9c":"I guess now we all understand what data augmentation stands for.\n\nNow if we train a new network using this data-augmentation configuration, the network will never see the same input twice. But the inputs it sees are still heavily intercorrelated, because they come from a small number of original images\u2014you can\u2019t produce new information, you can only remix existing information. As such, this may not be enough to completely get rid of overfitting. To further fight overfitting, you\u2019ll also add a Dropout layer to your model, right before the densely connected classifier.\n\nSo come on lets configure a new network again with data augmentation.","31f2e835":"And let\u2019s plot the results again. ","ef95e389":"By using regularization techniques even further, and by tuning the network\u2019s parameters (such as the number of filters per convolution layer, or the number of layers in the network), you may be able to get an even better accuracy, likely up to 86% or 87%. So keep trying, also try using batch normalization, it may prove good in order to reduce the fluctuations in the analysis curve.","e1ce28db":"These are just a few of the options available (for more, see the Keras documentation).\n\n* rotation_range is a value in degrees (0\u2013180), a range within which to randomly rotate pictures.\n* width_shift and height_shift are ranges (as a fraction of total width orheight) within which to randomly translate pictures vertically or horizontally.\n* shear_range is for randomly applying shearing transformations.\n* zoom_range is for randomly zooming inside pictures.\n* horizontal_flip is for randomly flipping half the images horizontally\u2014relevant when there are no assumptions of horizontal asymmetry (for example,real-world pictures).\n* fill_mode is the strategy used for filling in newly created pixels, which canappear after a rotation or a width\/height shift.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the augmented images\n","4f00302b":"Let\u2019s look at the output of one of these generators: it yields batches of 150 \u00d7 150 RGB images (shape (20, 150, 150, 3)) and binary labels (shape (20,)). There are 20 samples in each batch (the batch size). Note that the generator yields these batches indefinitely: it loops endlessly over the images in the target folder. For this reason, you need to break the iteration loop at some point.","e52a575f":"# Using data augmentation\nOverfitting is caused by having too few samples to learn from, rendering you unable to train a model that can generalize to new data. Given infinite data, your mode would be exposed to every possible aspect of the data distribution at hand: you would\nnever overfit. Data augmentation takes the approach of generating more training data from existing training samples, by augmenting the samples via a number of random transformations that yield believable-looking images. The goal is that at training time, your model will never see the exact same picture twice. This helps expose the model to more aspects of the data and generalize better. In Keras, this can be done by configuring a number of random transformations to be performed on the images read by the ImageDataGenerator instance. Let\u2019s get started with an example. ","b2b29590":"# DOG vs CAT classifier using a ConvNet\n\nWe previously built a small ConvNet for MNIST dataset. We wil go ahead with a similar structure for our networkover here too only since we are dealing with a bigger images and a more complex problem , so we will make our network larger than last time by just adding another pair of Conv2D and MaxPooling2D layers. This serves both to augment the capacity of the network and to further reduce the size of the feature maps so they aren\u2019t overly large when you reach the Flatten layer. Here, because you start from inputs of size 150 \u00d7 150 (a somewhat arbitrary choice), you end up with feature maps of size 7 \u00d7 7 just before the Flatten layer. \n\nAlso Note The depth of the feature maps progressively increases in the network(from 32 to 128), whereas the size of the feature maps decreases (from 148 \u00d7 148 to 7 \u00d7 7). This is a pattern you\u2019ll see in almost all convnets.\n\nBecause you\u2019re attacking a binary-classification problem, you\u2019ll end the network with a single unit (a Dense layer of size 1) and a sigmoid activation. This unit will encode the probability that the network is looking at one class or the other.\n\nOkay now lets start with defining the network","65f44124":"For the compilation step, you\u2019ll go with the RMSprop optimizer, as usual.
