For 2 or 4 calls, the price drops to between 150-200 currency. In this case, as the price of the product gets more expensive, people tend to call customer service more. Of course, it would be much more preferable to give customer service a headache instead of losing an order worth 300 dollars.","b4be39fc":"First of all, thank you guys for looking at my notebook. My method of examining the data was primarily to try to answer the curious questions after focusing on the remarkable correlation relations between the numerical data. I tried to visualize the data with as different graphic design as possible and make inferences with a humorous expression so that you do not get bored on the graphics. I wrote down many more questions in the frequently asked questions section, but unfortunately none of them had any striking results, so I gave up adding them to my notebook and had to settle for 4 questions. Designing this notebook taught me a lot. I hope you are satisfied with my project. If you like my work, please upvote and feel free to give me any feedback in the comments section, whatever you see missing or want to add. I wish everyone a good day.","bb1085d1":"According to the chart above, orders were mostly transported by ships. The number of materials transported by road and air is almost the same. The delivery rates of the products to the buyer on time are considered the same in 3 ways. Unfortunately, you will not be able to tell company officials which routa must be used your product to arrive faster.","b449cd69":"As can be seen in the graphic above, the products that received more than 10 US dollars discount did not arrive on time. 10 dollars and less discounted items were more often delivered to the buyer on time. So, if you've ordered a product with a discount of more than 10 dollars, don't expect it to arrive on time.","d6f5d418":"<a id=\"10\"><\/a><br>\n### What is The Number of Times The Products Stored In Each Warehouse Arrive on Time?","2c35d6a0":"<a id=\"7\"><\/a><br>\n### Relation Between Customer Care Calls - Cost of The Product","60fdc4cc":"<a id=\"3\"><\/a><br>\n### Correlation Between Numerical Values\n#### Understanding Correlation\nCorrelation shows the strength of a relationship between two variables and is expressed numerically by the correlation coefficient. The correlation coefficient's values range between -1.0 and 1.0. A perfect positive correlation means that the correlation coefficient is exactly 1. This implies that as one security moves, either up or down, the other security moves in lockstep, in the same direction. A perfect negative correlation (-1.0) means that two assets move in opposite directions, while a zero correlation implies no linear relationship at all.\n\n\nFor example, large-cap mutual funds generally have a high positive correlation to the Standard and Poor's (S&P) 500 Index or nearly one. Small-cap stocks have a positive correlation to the S&P, but it's not as high or approximately 0.8.\n\nHowever, put option prices and their underlying stock prices will tend to have a negative correlation. For review, a put option gives the owner the right, but not the obligation, to sell a specific amount of an underlying security at a pre-determined price within a specified time frame. Put option contracts become more profitable when the underlying stock price decreases. In other words, as the stock price increases, the put option prices go down, which is a direct and high-magnitude negative correlation.\n\nCalculated correlation (r) between two variables value:\n* r<0.20 and values close to zero are not related or indicates a very weak relationship.\n* Weak correlation between 0.20-0.39\n* Moderate correlation between 0.40-0.59\n* A high level of correlation between 0.60-0.79\n* If it is 0.80-1.0, it is interpreted as a very high correlation.","a4eb9108":"<a id=\"9\"><\/a><br>\n### Which Mode of Shipment is Faster Than Others?","cabf919a":"<a id=\"12\"><\/a><br>\n### Which products were the most liked by ways of transportation?","f1f8e007":"<a id=\"11\"><\/a><br>\n### Which Gender is More Satisfied With The Orders?","41a73317":"![g\u00f6rsel](https:\/\/www.marketingturkiye.com.tr\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/eticaret.jpg)\n# Introduction\nOnline marketing is growing day by day thanks to the worldwide spread of the Internet.This industry has grown so much that today the richest person in the world is Jeff Bezos, the former CEO of Amazon, an online shopping company.
