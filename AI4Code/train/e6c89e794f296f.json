This is done through the combined-means of economic, military, technological and cultural strength as well as diplomatic and soft power influence. Traditionally, superpowers are preeminent among the great powers.\nCurrently, only the United States fulfills the criteria to be considered a superpower.\n\nA potential superpower is a state or a political and economic entity that is speculated to be\u2014or to have the potential to soon become\u2014a superpower.\n\n## Emerging Superpowers\nChina on the other hand, has been referred to as an emerging superpower, given that Beijing's power is now beyond the classification of a Great Power. A great power is a sovereign state that is recognized as having the ability and expertise to exert its influence on a global scale. Great powers characteristically possess military and economic strength, as well as diplomatic and soft power influence, which may cause middle or small powers to consider the great powers' opinions before taking actions of their own.\n\n## Potential Superpowers\nThe European Union and the emerging BRIC economies comprising Brazil, Russia, and India are most commonly described as being potential superpowers.\n\n\n![image](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/9\/9e\/Potential_Superpowers.svg\/1920px-Potential_Superpowers.svg.png)\n\n\n<font color='yellow'>United States - Superpower<\/font> \n\n<font color='red'>China - Emerging Superpower<\/font>\n\n<font color='green'>India - Potential Superpower<\/font>\n\n<font color='purple'>Brazil - Potential Superpower<\/font> \n\n<font color='orange'>Russian Federation - Potential Superpower<\/font> \n\n<font color='blue'>European Union - Potential Superpower<\/font> \n\nSource: \n\n* By NuclearVacuum - https:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/w\/index.php?curid=6776645\n* https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Potential_superpowers\n\nUsing WorldBank data for Military Expenditure, Army Strength, GDP, Population and Land Area, I have collated the dataset.
