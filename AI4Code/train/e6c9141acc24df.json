Complete the function below to help her.\n\n(You're encouraged to use the `word_search` function you just wrote when implementing this function. Reusing code in this way makes your programs more robust and readable - and it saves typing!)","c28c58c1":"## 2.\n\nA researcher has gathered thousands of news articles. But she wants to focus her attention on articles including a specific word. Complete the function below to help her filter her list of articles.\n\nYour function should meet the following criteria\n\n- Do not include documents where the keyword string shows up only as a part of a larger word. For example, if she were looking for the keyword \u201cclosed\u201d, you would not include the string \u201cenclosed.\u201d \n- She does not want you to distinguish upper case from lower case letters. So the phrase \u201cClosed the case.\u201d would be included when the keyword is \u201cclosed\u201d\n- Do not let periods or commas affect what is matched. \u201cIt is closed.\u201d would be included when the keyword is \u201cclosed\u201d. But you can assume there are no other types of punctuation.","e4fa9537":"# Exercises","715a21e7":"## 1.\n\nThere is a saying that \"Data scientists spend 80% of their time cleaning data, and 20% of their time complaining about cleaning data.\" Let's see if you can write a function to help clean US zip code data. Given a string, it should return whether or not that string represents a valid zip code. For our purposes, a valid zip code is any string consisting of exactly 5 digits.\n\nHINT: `str` has a method that will be useful here. Use `help(str)` to review a list of string methods.","9f287fca":"These exercises accompany the tutorial on [strings and dictionaries](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/colinmorris\/strings-and-dictionaries).\n\nRun the setup code below before working on the questions (and run it again if you leave this notebook and come back later)."}}
