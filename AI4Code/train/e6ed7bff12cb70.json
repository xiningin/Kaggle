Besides the population at each decade, there is the precent share of the borough's population of NYC's total.\n\nFirst let us see how the precent share of each borough changes over the decades through a 'Precent Stacked barplot', as seen in Olivier Gaudard's example at https:\/\/python-graph-gallery.com\/13-percent-stacked-barplot\/","2c3f0168":"For this project I picked the 'New York City Crimes' dataset from Kaggle.
