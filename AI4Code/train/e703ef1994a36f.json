This is the fifth kernel of the series `Airbus Ship Detection Challenge - A quick overview for computer vision noobs.` This short and trivial kernel creates a 1.0 submission using the data shared by the Challenge organizers in response to the discovery of an important data leak.\n\n\nThe full series consist of the following notebooks:\n1. [Loading and visualizing the images](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/julian3833\/1-loading-and-visualizing-the-images)\n2. [Understanding and plotting rle bounding boxes](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/julian3833\/2-understanding-and-plotting-rle-bounding-boxes) \n3. [Basic exploratory analysis](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/julian3833\/3-basic-exploratory-analysis)\n4.

The organizers [recognized the leak ](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/airbus-ship-detection\/discussion\/64388) very fast and proposed a plan to address the situation. Following that plan, they [released the segmentations for the test set](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/airbus-ship-detection\/discussion\/64702) and will soon provide a new test set and reset the scoreboard.\n\nUntil this reset, we can trivially generate a 1.0 scoring submission just resending the `test_ship_segmentations.csv` file as follows."}}
