The attributes are data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods, accessed via dot notation.[tutorialspoint](https:\/\/www.tutorialspoint.com\/python\/python_classes_objects.htm)\n\n1. **Class variable** \u2212 A variable that is shared by all instances of a class. Class variables are defined within a class but outside any of the class's methods. Class variables are not used as frequently as instance variables are.\n\n1. **Data member** \u2212 A class variable or instance variable that holds data associated with a class and its objects.\n\n1. **Function overloading** \u2212 The assignment of more than one behavior to a particular function. The operation performed varies by the types of objects or arguments involved.\n\n1. **Instance variable** \u2212 A variable that is defined inside a method and belongs only to the current instance of a class.\n\n1. **Inheritance** \u2212 The transfer of the characteristics of a class to other classes that are derived from it.\n\n1. **Instance** \u2212 An individual object of a certain class. An object obj that belongs to a class Circle, for example, is an instance of the class Circle.\n\n1. **Instantiation** \u2212 The creation of an instance of a class.\n\n1. **Method** \u2212 A special kind of function that is defined in a class definition.\n\n1. **Object** \u2212 A unique instance of a data structure that's defined by its class.
