Random Forest being one of the most popular tree based models can learn the underlying rules according to which terms are tagged. It is important that the classifier has proper features fed in to improve the performance. \n<br> <br>\nWe chose Random Forest because of the following reasons - <br>\nFirstly, RF is able to automatically construct correlation paths from the feature space, i.e. decision rules that correspond to the translation rules that we intend to capture. <br>\nSecondly, RF is considered one of the most accurate classifier available.","723b28b0":"The goal of a named entity recognition (NER) system is to identify all textual mentions of the named entities. This can be broken down into two sub-tasks: identifying the boundaries of the NE, and identifying its type. \n<br><br>\nNamed entity recognition is a task that is well-suited to the type of classifier-based approach. In particular, a tagger can be built that labels each word in a sentence using the IOB format, where chunks are labelled by their appropriate type.\n<br><br>\nThe IOB Tagging system contains tags of the form:<br>\n**B** - {CHUNK_TYPE} \u2013 for the word in the Beginning chunk<br>\n**I** - {CHUNK_TYPE} \u2013 for words Inside the chunk<br>\n**O** \u2013 Outside any chunk<br>\n<br>\nThe IOB tags are further classified into the following classes \u2013 \n<br>\n**geo** = Geographical Entity<br>\n**org** = Organization<br>\n**per** = Person<br>\n**gpe** = Geopolitical Entity<br>\n**tim** = Time indicator<br>\n**art** = Artifact<br>\n**eve** = Event<br>\n**nat** = Natural Phenomenon<br>","5cdc3027":"*Although we have a good average score, the model performed quite badly. The precision and recall values of most of the classes were 0. It seems the features which require the model to take proper decisions are missing. The model is basically memorizing words and tags, which will not suffice. The context information behind each word needs to be fed to the model as well so that the predictions are more accurate. <br>\nWe can either work on this model alone by improving the features or ensembling it with a more contextual model, or use a different model altogether.*"}}
