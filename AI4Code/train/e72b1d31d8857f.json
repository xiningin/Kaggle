He has scored over 5000 runs at an average of 45.17 including 13 centuries and 26 half-centuries. However, the tournament where he really caught the eye of the selectors and the fans is the IPL.<br><br>\nVery few people know that Suryakumar had actually made his debut for Mumbai Indians in 2012. He got to play only his debut game and was out for a duck in 4 balls. However, he later went to the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) in 2014 and that\u2019s where his road to success began.","4a4fb09c":"![fewferq.JPG](attachment:fewferq.JPG)","60674adb":"SKY played from 2014-2017 for KKR and batted mostly in the middle and lower middle order. His responsibility was to hit big at the death and try to finish games or innings on a high.","cd04e5a6":"Thus, he has scored more runs for MI playing lesser cricket for them. In 41 innings for KKR, he scored 608 runs for them while he scored over 900 runs for the \u2018Men in Blue\u2019 in just 30 innings!<br><br>\nTo give a perspective of the amount of runs, here is a pie chart of his runs for each team:","1a58fcb3":"He has batted a similar number of innings at positions 1, 3, 4, 6 and 7. However, there is a clear difference at the top as he got the entire innings to bat. At No. 1 and 3, he has scored over 400 runs in less than 15 innings. His average is also commendable at the top of the order which indicates that he can make full use of the powerplay in the first six overs. A strike rate above 130 even after playing 300 balls is scary for any bowler. The only thing he would like to improve is that he has never stayed not out at the end of the innings whenever he has opened.<br><br>\nHis average at No. 5 is commendable adding to the Strike Rate above 150. He could explore that batting position more if he succeeds at that spot. Apart from top and middle order, Suryakumar has performed very well at No. 7 too, meaning he likes to finish games on a high too. At that position, has scored 226 runs at an average of 37.67 and a whopping Strike Rate of 160.28.<br><br>\nSuch a flexibility is rarely found in batsmen and Mumbai Indians are very blessed to have him in their side.<br><br>\n<b>Here is a graph of his runs at every batting position:<\/b>","e7b31f05":"Here is a pie chart of his runs scored at home\/away:","96205de1":"Next, I looked at his stats against each team in the IPL.

However, for KKR, as the first half of IPL 2014 was played outside India, not all games are at the Eden Gardens.<br><br>\nSKY has played 34 innings at home and 37 away from home. There isn\u2019t a lot of discrepancy in both as he has a similar record in both conditions.","38b60da3":"From the table, it is evident that SKY has scored most runs against Chennai Super Kings (CSK), Kings XI Punjab (KXIP) and Rajasthan Royals (RR) in that order. He averages a staggering 90 against Rising Pune Supergiant (RPS) and 55.67 against RR.<br><br>\nHe has scored runs against almost every team at a Strike Rate above 115 except for Pune Warriors India (PWI) and Gujarat Lions (GL) which is a combined total of just 4 matches.<br><br>\nHere are a few graphs of SKY against each team:\n","6800de72":"Till 2018, no uncapped player had even scored 400 runs in a single IPL season and Suryakumar went past the threshold remarkably by scoring 512 runs as he scored 30+ runs in 9 innings out of 14. In 2019, he did perform a little bit lesser than the previous year, but he had met the expectations. Due to his performances in 2019, he even got selected to play for \u2018India A\u2019 in New Zealand.<br><br>\nTaking a deeper look into his IPL performances, he took to batting at the top of the order like fish to water and let the fans wonder why he wasn\u2019t already batting at the top.<br><br>\n<b>Here is his performance at each batting position:<\/b>","5bf898d8":"The number of fours against each team came out to be directly proportional to the number of runs scored by Suryakumar Yadav against each team.

He then moved to Mumbai Indians where they decided to let him bat higher up the order. He was mostly slotted at the opening or No. 4 position. The decision did prove to be effective as his aggressive approach gave Mumbai Indians the start they always wanted.<br><br>\n<b>His numbers for MI are as follows: <\/b>"}}
