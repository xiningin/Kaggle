Access operations","386b2b11":"Note that, with tensors, the elements of the last axis are always numbers. Every other axis will contain n-dimensional arrays. This is what we see in this example, but this idea generalizes.\n\nThe rank of a tensor tells us how many axes a tensor has, and the length of these axes leads us to the very important concept known as the shape of a tensor.","8dbef8a9":"Now, suppose we want to access (refer to) the number 3 in this data structure.

Any time we change a tensor's shape, we are said to be reshaping the tensor.","51f8ddcb":"\nLet\u2019s look at a common use case for squeezing a tensor by building a flatten function.\n\n## Flatten A Tensor\nA flatten operation on a tensor reshapes the tensor to have a shape that is equal to the number of elements contained in the tensor. This is the same thing as a 1d-array of elements.\n\n\n\n```\nFlattening a tensor means to remove all of the dimensions except for one.\n```\n\n","8481a863":"Each element along the second axis, is a number:","4798fbba":"Since the argument t can be any tensor, we pass -1 as the second argument to the reshape() function. In TensorFlow, the -1 tells the reshape() function to figure out what the value should be based on the number of elements contained within the tensor. Remember, the shape must equal the product of the shape's component values. This is how TensorFlow can figure out what the value should be, given a 1 as the first argument.\n\nSince our tensor t has 12 elements, the reshape() function is able to figure out that a 12 is required for the length of the second axis.\n\nAfter squeezing, the first axis (axis-0) is removed, and we obtain our desired result, a 1d-array of length 12.\n\nHere's an example of this in action:","f390066a":"Each element along the first axis, is an array:","85481b9f":"\n####**Indexes:** \n\nIndexes are required to access an element in a Data Structure.\n\n![image name](https:\/\/dphi-courses.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com\/introduction-to-numpy\/index+humans+and+python.png)","cc524084":"# Introduction to Tensors","7465316e":"####**Dimension:** \n\nLet\u2019s take an example of box to explain this.
