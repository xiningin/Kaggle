Here, in this ensemble method, we now aggregate the predictions from all the classifiers. This helps in predicting the class that gets the majority vote. Such way of voting is called 'Hard voting'.  The combined score is less than the accuracy score of LogisticRegression- 97.49% .  To get a better score, we move to 'Soft voting'.","8a28f844":"Surprisingly, this dataset doesn't have missing data. Cool! ","f6867d37":"Next, we explore if and how these features are corrleted to one another. This is done using heatmap (as shown below).

Also, we code Malignant and Benign cases with numbers- 1 and 0 respectively.","839251d4":"### Plots\nNext we make some Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) plots to check the distribution of malignant and benign cases for various features.","26328fc6":"Next, we check the distribution and statistics of data.

We get a high accuracy of 97.5% with a high precision and recall rate of 97.9% and 95.2% respectively.","632718cc":"Next, we move to another most-versatile and easy to interpret and understand algorithm- Decision Trees. The result isn't as great as we have seen for SVC and logistic regression. ","c5f2668b":"Before building model one thing that we must work on is to reduce or select the number of features. For this we will use Principal Component Analysis (PCA). PCA is an approach to obtain a few number of features from a large set. This aids in dimensionality reduction which can otherwise lead to high variance. Before performing PCA, it is crucial to standardize predictors to ensure all features are on the same scale. Otherwise, features that have high variance will influence the outcome of PCA. Here, we first use `StandardScaler` followed by PCA. Instead of arbitrarily choosing the number of dimension, we choose the number of dimensions that can explain most of the variance (usually 95% of the variance). To do that, we plot 'cumulative explained variance' vs 'number of components'. From this it seems that most of the variance can be explained by 10 components. So, we proceed with that number for PCA.","3ef73ef4":"Next, we try KNeighborsClassifier. We obtain a high accuracy of 97.49% . Precision and recall are high as well, 98.5% and 89.7%. respectively. One can also check confusion matrix to check true positive\/negative and false positive\/negative (as shown below). But for rest of the analysis, I focus on the precision and recall score than confusion matrix.","ba34331c":"From Decision Tree we move to their forest -RandomForest.

In this case instead of prediting the class based on majority votes, class probabilities are aggregated and the class is predicted based on the class that gets highest class probability on averaged over all the classifiers. This type of voting usually achieves higher performance than hard voting. An important thing to remember is that soft voting only works with classifiers that can predict probabilities or have predict_proba function. To perform, soft voting we have to turn SVC's probability to True.   Accuracy reduces to 96.73% if we include all the classifiers. But it increases to 98.24% if we only consider LogisticRegression, SVC,RandomForest. FYI-if I use the same 3 classifiers and perform hard voting, accuracy remains 96.98%.
