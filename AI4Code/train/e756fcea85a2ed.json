A temperature anomaly is the difference from an average, or baseline, temperature. A positive anomaly indicates the observed temperature was warmer than the baseline, while a negative anomaly indicates the observed temperature was cooler than the baseline.\n\n![NASA](https:\/\/climate.nasa.gov\/system\/content_pages\/main_images\/203_co2-graph-021116.jpeg)\n\nAccording to NASA, the Earth's climate has changed throughout history. Most of these climate changes are attributed to very small variations in Earth\u2019s orbit that change the amount of solar energy our planet receive. \nThe current warming trend is of particular significance because most of it is extremely likely to be the result of human activity since the mid-20th century and proceeding at a rate that is unprecedented over decades to millennial.[](http:\/\/)"}}
