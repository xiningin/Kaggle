The trend and seasonality components are optional. It is helpful to think of the components as combining either **additively or multiplicatively.**\n\nAn **additive model** suggests that the components are added together as follows:\n\n> **y(t) = Level + Trend + Seasonality + Noise**\n\nAn additive model is linear where changes over time are consistently made by the same amount. A linear seasonality has the same frequency (width of cycles) and amplitude (height of cycles).\n\nA **multiplicative model** suggests that the components are multiplied together as follows:\n\n> **y(t) = Level * Trend * Seasonality * Noise**\n\nA multiplicative model is nonlinear, such as quadratic or exponential. Changes increase or decrease over time. A non-linear seasonality has an increasing or decreasing frequency and\/or amplitude over time.\n\nDecomposition provides a structured way of thinking about a time series forecasting problem, both generally in terms of modeling complexity and specifically in terms of how to best capture each of these components in a given model.\n\nEach of these components are something you may need to think about and address during data preparation, model selection, and model tuning. You may address it explicitly in terms of modeling the trend and subtracting it from your data, or implicitly by providing enough history for an algorithm to model a trend if it may exist.\n\nIn order to implement the naive or classical decomposition method, we use the seasonal_decompose() method provided by the statsmodels library. It requires you to specify whether the model is Additive or Multiplicative.
