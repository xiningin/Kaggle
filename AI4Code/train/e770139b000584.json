A survey of the World Health Organization adapted to the local context was applied. Open-ended questions were included to study people's feelings about COVID-19, and content analysis was subsequently conducted. \n\nIn terms of results, it is revealed that the population surveyed feels uncertainty, fear and anguish, albeit a feeling of responsibility and care in the face of COVID-19 also emerges. \n\nMoreover, positive feelings regarding society stand out as an achievement of social interdependence. The results obtained show that the impact on mental health differs in accordance with gender, educational level, and perceived comfort in the home.\n\nThe study concludes that the emotional and bonding dimensions of people are central to confronting the COVID-19 pandemic. It is recommended that these dimensions, as well as their subjective and differential social impact among the different population groups, should be considered in the planning of policies to address the COVID-19 pandemic.\nhttps:\/\/www.scielo.br\/scielo.php?pid=S1413-81232020006702447&script=sci_abstract","12a93ad7":"The non-acceptance of the disease can be related to \u201cnot feeling vulnerable\u201d.\n\nSignificant differences in beliefs and attitudes regarding gender in the Covid-19 pandemic have already been raised in a Brazilian study that shows that women perceive themselves more vulnerable to the coronavirus, thereby expressing a greater sense of self-care.\n\nIn this sense, the disease framing may reveal significant differences in gender still little explored.\nhttps:\/\/www.scielo.br\/scielo.php?pid=S1413-81232020000903481&script=sci_arttext&tlng=en","15ef9938":"#Coping with your feelings during the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nGuidance by NHS Lanarkshire Psychological Services. Version 4.5, 20 November 2020\n\nFirst and foremost, be kind to yourself\n\nIt is normal to have feelings such as stress, anxiety, sadness and fear in times like these. The coronavirus crisis is unlike anything we\u2019ve experienced before.\n\nOne of the scariest things is the uncertainty. Everything keeps changing: just when it feels like things might be getting better, they seem to get worse again. Human beings hate uncertainty and want guaranteed answers. Because there aren\u2019t any \u2013 and because it sometimes feels like there\u2019s so much different information flying around \u2013 our anxiety is often likely to be high. Again, this is the most normal thing in the world right now.\n\nAnxiety brings with it lots of different physical feelings. This can include a racing heart, chest pain, sweatiness and shortness of breath. Again, all of these are very normal. They aren\u2019t pleasant \u2013 but they are normal.\n\nWhen our lives feel so different and uncertain, that can give rise to very understandable frustration, confusion and worry. We might notice that our mood slumps. Our minds might keep bombarding us with questions: when will things get better? Will there be a second wave? What else might go wrong?\n\nNo matter how hard we try, none of us can actually stop different thoughts and feelings from showing up. What we can do, though, is learn ways of coping with them and responding differently to them.\n\nThe most important thing is to allow yourself to feel what you\u2019re feeling. It\u2019s OK not to feel OK. Our thoughts and feelings might keep on changing very rapidly: that\u2019s totally normal.\n\nDifferent people will feel different things at different times, and that\u2019s OK too. We\u2019re not always going to be on the same page as our family and friends.\n\nRemember: we can\u2019t switch off our thoughts and feelings.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.nhslanarkshire.scot.nhs.uk\/novel-corona-virus-covid-19\/managing-anxiety\/","21a0be63":"![](https:\/\/www.who.int\/images\/default-source\/wpro\/health-topic\/covid-19\/slide5ce5aa04d79004f659a5c91667dece224.jpg)who.int"}}
