They admitted that following the proper steps to validate a psychological test and improving some aspects related to MBTI psychometric metrics, it could eventually become a recognised personality framework.\n\nReference:\\\n[McCrae, R.

It is used in businesses, online, for fun, for research and lots more. A simple google search reveals all of the different ways the test has been used over time. It\u2019s safe to say that this test is still very relevant in the world in terms of its use.\n\nFrom scientific or psychological perspective it is based on the work done on [cognitive functions](http:\/\/www.cognitiveprocesses.com\/Cognitive-Functions\/) by Carl Jung i.e. Jungian Typology. This was a model of 8 distinct functions, thought processes or ways of thinking that were suggested to be present in the mind. Later this work was transformed into several different personality systems to make it more accessible, the most popular of which is of course the MBTI.\n\nI need to add that for the dataset I generated I haven't used the original MBTI test, but a test based on it, [16Personalities](https:\/\/www.16personalities.com\/), which adds a new axis that I omitted for validity reasons.\n\n**Content**\n\nThis dataset contains over 8600 rows of data, on each row is a person\u2019s:\n\n- Type (This persons 4 letter MBTI code\/type)\n- A section of each of the last 50 things they have posted (Each entry separated by '|||' (3 pipe characters))"}}
