This indicates most of the victors have low kill counts relative to the other players. Maybe going out and killing as much as you can isn't the best strategy! Going to drop the columns that provide no correlation with in place percentage.\n\nThe highest correlated features (including negative correlations) are walking distance, kill place, boosts, and weapons acquired. Lets take a look at these more in depth.","5aeb9917":"<h2> First things first<\/h2>\nWe need to load in the data from the csv file into a pandas dataframe and print out the first couple rows to see what we have in terms of data.

A heatmap would be a good start to see what kind of correlations we get. From experience playing the game, I think that features revolving around kills will correlate highly with winPlacePerc. I also believe accuracy would be a great indicator; however, that is not an included feature."}}
