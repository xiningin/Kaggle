The classification task is to determine the edibility given the physical characteristics of the mushrooms.\n\nThis dataset includes descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family Mushroom drawn from The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms (1981). Each species is identified as definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or of unknown edibility and not recommended. This latter class was combined with the poisonous one. The Guide clearly states that there is no simple rule for determining the edibility of a mushroom; no rule like \"leaflets three, let it be'' for Poisonous Oak and Ivy.\n\nThanks to sir @Raven Duran for sharing his thoughs, it helps me to grasp the basic concept of data science workflow on supervised learning.","40811af7":"# IV.
