Perhaps the higher paid people are actually just much, much better at doing the same things using the same tools that the lower paid employees are doing.\n* Perhaps it is based on much more specific information that was not included in the survey like where someone lives or what specific school they went to or what company they work for.  Example: A data scientist at a huge corporation might be a rockstar in terms of pay.\n* Because it's not clear who is a consultant vs who is direct employee, it's possible that the higher paid employees are simply bringing in more money due to the higher rates consultants need to charge.  There is one question 'Select the title most similar to your current role' where people can say they are a consultant, but it might be confusing for people to select between 'consultant' and 'data analyst' when they are both.\n* Perhaps there is something specific about people who join Kaggle and fill out the survey that makes it harder to differentiate them by salary since they are more likely to to have a strong interest in the field.\n\nThe survey included a lot of interesting information and although it didn't yield easy information about salary, there were some interesting things that did come out. (See appendix for additional data and charts.)\n\nSome questions that might be interesting for future surveys:\n\n* Which best describes your employment status? Unemployed, Full-time, Part-time, Self-employed, Retired.\n* What percentage of your work time is spent on data science work? \n* What size company do you work for? Small (1-100), Medium (100-1000), Large (1000+)","1aff7f2d":"<a id='Q34'><\/a>\n\n### During a typical data science project at work or school, approximately what proportion of your time is devoted to the following?\n\nSurprisingly this did not seem to change substantially by salary range.\n","46bdfe87":"<a id='Q16'><\/a>\n\n### What programming languages do you use on a regular basis? \n\nPython, R and SQL are the big ones.
