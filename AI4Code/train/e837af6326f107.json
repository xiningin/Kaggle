Furthermore, having a strong economy should entail that country investing in and having a good health-care system and facilities.

This may not give us the most accurate information, but it may help compliment our previous analysis. \n\nI believe the third measure would be the best to use for our analysis since people being fully vaccinated would be a good measure of an advanced vaccine programme.

This means that for a million people, only 4000 people are getting vaccinated worldwide. This value may be low due to a number of reasons. One reason could be that the worldwide population is generally hesitant to get a vaccination shot. This could be due to a lack of information and awareness of vaccines, how they work and why they are needed (especially during this pandemic). Another reason could be that in alot of countries, vaccines are only available to front-line health workers and people over the age of 60 or 65. Therefore, once the vaccines become available to the general population, these numbers would automatically increase.  ","ee3d6d89":"As shown above, China leads the way with the most number of vaccinations followed by USA, India and the United Kingdom. This result makes sense since the three most used vaccines (on the basis of daily vaccinations) are produced by three  of the four countries mentioned above. Therefore, since these countries produced these vaccines, they would be the first ones to start vaccinating their populations, hence having higher number of overall vaccinations.\n\nBut this result does not take into account the population level of countries. A country having an advanced vaccination programme and making the most progress with regards to getting their population fully vaccinated would entail having higher values of vaccination rate per a population measure. In our dataset, we have four such measure namely:\n\n1) *Total Vaccinations (per hundred)*\n\n2) *People Vaccinated (per hundred)*         \n\n3) *People Fully Vaccinated (per hundred)*  \n\n4) *Daily Vaccinations (per million)*       \n\nBut since the first three measures have a high number of Null values (as shown at the start of the analysis), it would be best to use the fourth measure.","64bd809d":"As demonstrated in the graph above, despite there being peaks and valleys, the general trend of average daily vaccinations is in an upward direction. Since the start of March 2021, there has been a huge increase in the worldwide average daily vaccinations. This could be because of the approval of several different vaccines and the increase in availablilty of these vaccines to countries over the first few months of 2021.
