However, analysing better we realise that there are 94 books which are duplicated in 189 rows, therefore some books are bestsellers across different years.\n- Analysing some features (number of books by author, rating and Price), we decide to compare the whole dataset and remove duplicate books, as a result the frequency decreases but the distriubtion shapes remain quite similar.\n- Regarding the genre feature, the bestsellers contain more non-fictinon than fiction, however when we remove the duplicate books, the number between different genres is quite similar. In addition )looking at [the line graph](#conclusion1) with number of books which are sold over the years, distinguishing genre, all years, non-fiction are more bestseller than fiction, except for 2014 that was inside out. \n- The [correlations](#conclusion2) between numeric variables are not very high. The majority of values are close to 0, so this mean it does not exit a big dependecy neither negative or positive.\n- [Boxplot](#conclusion3) draws data ditribution for the numeric features, which are Price, User rating and Review, over 11 years. Regarding the price feature, the data distribution are quite similar over the years because the books' prices did not change. Regarding User rating, there are some variations in data distribution, for example, the data are concentrated around 5 in 2019. Reviews, at the beging the data distribution are more concentrated and after 2012 there is more dispersion, this means that people start to get used to writing reviews.\n- [Scatter plot](#conclusion4), to see the relationship between variables.
