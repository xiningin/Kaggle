You call a function by placing parentheses to the right of the function name. Some functions allow you to pass **arguments** inside the parentheses (separating multiple arguments with a comma). Internal to the function, these arguments are treated like variables.\n\nPython has several useful built-in functions to help you work with different objects and\/or your environment. Here is a small sample of them:\n\n- **`type(obj)`** to determine the type of an object\n- **`len(container)`** to determine how many items are in a container\n- **`sum(container)`** to compute the sum of a container of numbers\n- **`min(container)`** to determine the smallest item in a container\n- **`max(container)`** to determine the largest item in a container\n- **`abs(number)`** to determine the absolute value of a number\n\n> Complete list of built-in functions: https:\/\/docs.python.org\/3\/library\/functions.html","add70988":"### Basic operators\n\nIn Python, there are different types of **operators** (special symbols) that operate on different values.

Operators with higher precedence are evaluated first (like PEMDAS in math). Operators with the same precedence are evaluated from left to right.\n\n- `()` parentheses, for grouping\n- `**` exponent\n- `*`, `\/` multiplication and division\n- `+`, `-` addition and subtraction\n- `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=` comparisons\n\n> See https:\/\/docs.python.org\/3\/reference\/expressions.html#operator-precedence\n\nExamples:","618079e1":"# Why Python? <a id='intro'><\/a>","243ac6b4":"**Exceptions:**\nExceptions occur during run-time.

The strings, lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries we defined are all **iterable** containers.\n\nThe for loop will go through the specified container, one item at a time, and provide a temporary variable for the current item. You can use this temporary variable like a normal variable.","82cf1749":"### Now lets put it all into a single function that we can call later...","52deb644":"![image.png](attachment:image.png) \n### Cyrille Doux\n - UPenn Physics PostDoc working with Bhuvnesh Jain\n - French\n - Machine Learning Guru - works on ML blending of galaxies.","543a9b28":"**Example:** A `for` loop program which prints each string in a list along with the number of letters in each string.","c056c0d5":"![What%20is%20your%20department%20at%20Penn_.png](attachment:What%20is%20your%20department%20at%20Penn_.png)","27c92b70":"### Python objects, basic types, and variables \n\nEverything in Python is an **object** and every object in Python has a **type**. Some of the basic types include:\n\n- **`int`** (integer; a whole number with no decimal place)\n  - `10`\n  - `-3`\n- **`float`** (float; a number that has a decimal place)\n  - `7.41`\n  - `-0.006`\n- **`str`** (string; a sequence of characters enclosed in single quotes, double quotes, or triple quotes)\n  - `'this is a string using single quotes'`\n  - `\"this is a string using double quotes\"`\n  - `'''this is a triple quoted string using single quotes'''`\n  - `\"\"\"this is a triple quoted string using double quotes\"\"\"`\n- **`bool`** (boolean; a binary value that is either true or false)\n  - `True`\n  - `False`\n- **`NoneType`** (a special type representing the absence of a value)\n  - `None`\n\nIn Python, a **variable** is a name you specify in your code that maps to a particular **object**, object **instance**, or value.\n\nBy defining variables, we can refer to things by names that make sense to us. Names for variables can only contain letters, underscores (`_`), or numbers (no spaces, dashes, or other characters). Variable names must start with a letter or underscore.","1647986d":"## Still want more? lets go through these\nhttps:\/\/www.datacamp.com\/community\/tutorials\/18-most-common-python-list-questions-learn-python","91adf120":"### Dictionary comprehension","8b7c6788":"## Exercise 3:\nWrite a function called exercise3(n) that adds up the numbers 1 through n and prints out the result.
