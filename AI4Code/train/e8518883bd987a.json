Split the dataset into training and testing dataset. The testing dataset is generally smaller than training one as it will help in training the model better.\n 2. Select any algorithm based on the problem (classification or regression) whatever you feel may be good.\n 3. Then pass the training dataset to the algorithm to train it. We use the **.fit()** method\n 4. Then pass the testing data to the trained algorithm to predict the outcome. We use the **.predict()** method.\n 5. We then check the accuracy by **passing the predicted outcome and the actual output** to the model.","70f48d79":"### We used all the features of iris in above models.
