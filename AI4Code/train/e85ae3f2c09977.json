And this process is called **Data Science**. \n\n\n\nLet\u2019s look at a fairly typical example of a data scientist in action. Perhaps a major business, say a cell phone company, wants to know what current customers are more likely to switch services to their competitor. They may hire a data analyst who can look at millions of different data points (or more specifically, create an algorithm to look at millions of data points) related to former customers. They may discover that customers who use a certain amount of bandwidth are more likely to leave, or that customers who are married and between the ages of 35 and 45 are the most likely to switch carriers.

The most popular question upcoming data scientist ask that how to become a data scientist. There are many answers online. But in this kernel, I will try to answer the question **based on the survey data**. ","5edc393b":"![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/91NIQ3t.png)","52ae1242":"# Who are a Data scientist and What is Data Science? \n> According to **Wikipedia**, *Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from data in various forms, both structured and unstructured, similar to data mining.*\n\nIt seems like there are a lot of confusing words used. If I gave you a simple answer that will be, ***\" Applying Science to data to find meaningful information and solve data related problem is called data science and those people who do this is called data scientist\" *** \n\nWell! Let's see what the **data** is telling about who is a data scientist or what is data science? ","6a3d82dd":"##  1. Gathering Data\n> Firstly you need data to **work** or practise. For most of the data science work, the **first step** is to collect **right and elegant** data. What do I mean by right and elegant data? Well, let's imagine a scenario, you work for a game company. Suddenly one of the popular game of your company starts **losing players**. You have to find the solutions for that problem The first step is to collect data. So if you have to collect the right data like which levels players are dropping and **which region** the most players the game losing and find pattern into it. And this is called collecting **right dataset**. \n\nSometimes you have to find data online. In this case, you have to find data through an online platform. There are many platforms available. How do you choose? Well, it depends. Let's see what's our **data is telling about. **","4957f4f3":"![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/JniFNxl.png)","9815a0bd":"# Skills needed for Data Science\n> In order to become a data scientist you need a lot of skills in your tool box. Let's see a summarized version of skills set a data scientist need in this picture .. \n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/3x1o3Vl.png)\n","36f986bd":"# Data description\n> This year, Kaggle set out to conduct an industry-wide survey that presents a truly comprehensive view of the state of data science and machine learning. The survey was live for one week in October. After the survey, the data was cleaned by Kaggle and uploaded to Kaggle datasets. I will use this dataset to answer the question 'How to become a Data Scientist'\n\n> **Overview** of the dataset according to Kaggle: \n>> There are three CSV file in this dataset. **a) freeFromResponse, b) multipleChoiceResponse, c) SurveySchema ** \n\n>> 1. **multipleChoiceResponse**: The 2018 Kaggle Machine Learning & Data Science Survey dataset. It is the main file I will be working with. This file contains multiple choice answers to survey questions. \n\n>> 2. **freeFromResponse**: When survey respondents selected the \"Other\" category, an option was given for a text response. These text responses were separated and shuffled to protect user privacy. I will not use this dataset in this kernel. \n\n>> 3. **SurveySchema**: How many respondents answered each question?\n","d7702e9e":"We can see the most popular task of Data Scientist in this plot. Let's see how to build each of this skills to become a data scientist. ","0a21361c":"The number on cloud computing service is **EC2** by Amazon. It is the most popular cloud computing service around the world. It means elastic computing. It means it can **grow** as you wish and **decrease** as you wish. Meaning you can increase or decrease your virtual computer configuration easily. For this reason, it became so popular. \n\n**We are seeing that there are many people who don't use cloud computing service. Is it not necessary? It is absolutely necessary. The industry is looking for this skills. If you want to stand out from the crowd then this is the must skill you master. **","60363eff":"# 2. Cleaning data\n> We have seen from the above plot that this step is the most popular task where data scientist spent time. Because real-world data is **messy**. It comes in all sort of form. You have to clean the data. Here clean means is the way of **organizing data** so that it's **easy** to use and **meaningful**. Let's see the previous scenario we are talking about. So you collect information about losing players. But you are seeing that there is some missing information. And sometimes some values are unexpected. That's called an outlier. **An outlier** is a great disaster for data analysis. It can give the wrong answer to your problem. So you have to clean this. That's why data cleaning is so **important**. \n\n**Python** - Well then how should you clean your data. In every programming language for data science have some sort dataset handling library. Like python has **Pandas**. Pandas is a wonderful library for data handling. You can clean and manage data using pandas.  If you become a data scientist that uses Python, pandas will quickly become one of your main tools! It is personally my favourite Python library! \n\n**R**\u200a\u2014\u200aFor the most part R already comes with a lot of data analysis features **built-in**, such as Dataframes! But the R community has also created a lot of useful packages for helping deal with data in an even more efficient manner! These packages are known as the \u201ctidy verse\u201d, and its a collection of useful packages for data science, all designed with a similar philosophy of working with data, meaning that they all work very well **together**.","2a7edbc4":"# Popular online platform \n> There are many online learning platforms available. Some platforms are good for some area of specialization. It can be frustrating to find the right one for yourself. Because you want to be a data scientist, let's see what is the most popular online learning platforms for the data scientist. "}}
