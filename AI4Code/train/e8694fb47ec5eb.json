Now is the time to find the similarity between movies.\n\nWe will use the correlation between the ratings of a movie as the similarity metric.

We will then display the first five movies along with their average rating using the head() method. Look at the the following script:","50e9b71f":"### Data Visualization and Preprocessing\n\nThe first step in every data science problem is to visualize and preprocess the data.

Furthermore, it is evident that the data has a weak normal distribution with the mean of around 3.5. There are a few outliers in the data.\n\nEarlier, we said that movies with a higher number of ratings usually have a high average rating as well since a good movie is normally well-known and a well-known movie is watched by a large number of people, and thus usually has a higher rating. Let's see if this is also the case with the movies in our dataset. We will plot average ratings against the number of ratings:\n","3752072d":"Now you can see some really good movies at the top. The above list supports our point that good movies normally receive higher ratings. Now we know that both the average rating per movie and the number of ratings per movie are important attributes.

We need a dataset that contains the userId, movie title, and its ratings. We have this information in two different dataframe objects: \"ratings_data\" and \"movie_names\". To get our desired information in a single dataframe, we can merge the two dataframes objects on the movieId column since it is common between the two dataframes.\n\nWe can do this using merge() function from the Pandas library, as shown below:","d4bb629b":"From the output you can see that the movies that have high correlation with \"Forrest Gump (1994)\" are not very well known. This shows that correlation alone is not a good metric for similarity because there can be a user who watched '\"Forest Gump (1994)\" and only one other movie and rated both of them as 5.\n\nA solution to this problem is to retrieve only those correlated movies that have at least more than 50 ratings. To do so, will add the rating_counts column from the rating_mean_count dataframe to our corr_forrest_gump dataframe. Execute the following script to do so:","b6091142":"Now you can see from the output the movies that are highly correlated with \"Forrest Gump (1994)\".

It is important to mention that the recommender system we created is very simple. Real-life recommender systems use very complex algorithms and will be discussed in a later.","71c25f84":"## Introduction\n\nHave you ever wondered how Netflix suggests movies to you based on the movies you have already watched? Or how does an e-commerce websites display options such as \"Frequently Bought Together\"? They may look relatively simple options but behind the scenes, a complex statistical algorithm executes in order to predict these recommendations. Such systems are called Recommender Systems, Recommendation Systems, or Recommendation Engines. A Recommender System is one of the most famous applications of data science and machine learning.\n\nA Recommender System employs a statistical algorithm that seeks to predict users' ratings for a particular entity, based on the similarity between the entities or similarity between the users that previously rated those entities. The intuition is that similar types of users are likely to have similar ratings for a set of entities.\n\nCurrently, many of the big tech companies out there use a Recommender System in one way or another. You can find them anywhere from Amazon (product recommendations) to YouTube (video recommendations) to Facebook (friend recommendations). The ability to recommend relevant products or services to users can be a huge boost for a company, which is why it's so common to find this technique employed in so many sites.\n\nIn this Kernel, we will see how we can build a simple recommender system in Python.\n\n\n## Types of Recommender Systems\n\nThere are two major approaches to build recommender systems: Content-Based Filtering and Collaborative Filtering:\n\n### Content-Based Filtering\n\nIn content-based filtering, the similarity between different products is calculated on the basis of the attributes of the products. For instance, in a content-based movie recommender system, the similarity between the movies is calculated on the basis of genres, the actors in the movie, the director of the movie, etc.\n\n### Collaborative Filtering\n\nCollaborative filtering leverages the power of the crowd. The intuition behind collaborative filtering is that if a user A likes products X and Y, and if another user B likes product X, there is a fair bit of chance that he will like the product Y as well.\n\nTake the example of a movie recommender system. Suppose a huge number of users have assigned the same ratings to movies X and Y. A new user comes who has assigned the same rating to movie X but hasn't watched movie Y yet. Collaborative filtering system will recommend him the movie Y.\n\n","cfe0f8c9":"The movies have now been sorted according to the ascending order of their ratings. However, there is a problem. A movie can make it to the top of the above list even if only a single user has given it five stars. Therefore, the above stats can be misleading. Normally, a movie which is really a good one gets a higher rating by a large number of users.\n\nLet's now plot the total number of ratings for a movie:","ac82ae76":"You can see that the movie 'burbs, The (1989)', which has the highest correlation has only 17 ratings. This means that only 17 users gave same ratings to \"Forest Gump (1994)\", \"'burbs, The (1989)\". However, we can deduce that a movie cannot be declared similar to the another movie based on just 17 ratings. This is why we added \"rating_counts\" column. Let's now filter movies correlated to \"Forest Gump (1994)\", that have more than 50 ratings. The following code will do that:\n\n","6e50beb5":"Let's sort the movies in descending order of correlation to see highly correlated movies at the top. Execute the following script:"}}
