The fate of Dr. Semmelweis\nAll in all, it would seem that Semmelweis had solid evidence that handwashing was a simple but highly effective procedure \nthat could save many lives.\n\nThe tragedy is that, despite the evidence,\nSemmelweis' theory \u2014 that childbed fever was caused by some \"substance\" (what we today know as bacteria)\nfrom autopsy room corpses \u2014 was ridiculed by contemporary scientists.\nThe medical community largely rejected his discovery and in 1849 he was forced to leave the Vienna General Hospital for good.\n\nOne reason for this was that statistics and statistical arguments were uncommon in medical science in the 1800s. \nSemmelweis only published his data as long tables of raw data, but he didn't show any graphs nor confidence intervals. \nIf he would have had access to the analysis we've just put together he might have been more successful\nin getting the Viennese doctors to wash their hands.","d3d0d7fc":"### 2. The alarming number of deaths\nThe table above shows the number of women giving birth at the two clinics at the Vienna General Hospital for the years 1841\nto 1846. You'll notice that giving birth was very dangerous; an alarming number of women died as the result of childbirth,\nmost of them from childbed fever.\n\nWe see this more clearly if we look at the proportion of deaths out of the number of women giving birth.\nLet's zoom in on the proportion of deaths at `Clinic 1`.","523e11dc":"### 3. Death at the clinics\nIf we now plot the proportion of deaths at both `clinic 1` and `clinic 2` we'll see a curious pattern...","eb06a151":"In 1847, the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis makes a breakthough discovery: He discovers handwashing.\nContaminated hands was a major cause of childbed fever and by enforcing handwashing at his hospital he saved hundreds of lives.\n\nIn this python project we will reanalyze the medical data Semmelweis collected\n\n\nDr. Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian physician born in 1818 and active at the Vienna General Hospital.\nIf Dr. Semmelweis looks troubled it's probably because he's thinking about childbed fever:\nA deadly disease affecting women that just have given birth.\nHe is thinking about it because in the early 1840s at the Vienna General Hospital as many as 10% of the women giving birth die \nfrom it. He is thinking about it because he knows the cause of childbed fever: \nIt's the contaminated hands of the doctors delivering the babies. And they won't listen to him and wash their hands!\n\nIn this notebook, we're going to reanalyze the data that made Semmelweis discover the importance of handwashing.\nLet's start by looking at the data that made Semmelweis realize that something was wrong with the procedures\nat Vienna General Hospital.","0e402a4f":"### 6. The effect of handwashing highlighted\nStarting from the summer of 1847 the proportion of deaths is drastically reduced and, \nyes, this was when Semmelweis made handwashing obligatory.\n\nThe effect of handwashing is made even more clear if we highlight this in the graph.","98004716":"### 4. The handwashing begins\u00b6\nWhy is the proportion of deaths constantly so much higher in `Clinic 1`? \nSemmelweis saw the same pattern and was puzzled and distressed. \nThe only difference between the clinics was that many medical students served at `Clinic 1`, \nwhile mostly midwife students served at `Clinic 2`. While the midwives only tended to the women giving birth,\nthe medical students also spent time in the autopsy rooms examining corpses.\n\nSemmelweis started to suspect that something on the corpses, spread from the hands of the medical students, \ncaused childbed fever. So in a desperate attempt to stop the high mortality rates, he decreed: Wash your hands!\n    This was an unorthodox and controversial request, nobody in Vienna knew about bacteria at this point in time.\n\nLet's load in monthly data from `Clinic 1` to see if the handwashing had any effect.","b912eea0":"### 7. More handwashing, fewer deaths?\nAgain, the graph shows that handwashing had a huge effect.\nHow much did it reduce the monthly proportion of deaths on average?","64d0dce2":"### 5. The effect of handwashing\nWith the data loaded we can now look at the proportion of deaths over time.\nIn the plot below we haven't marked where obligatory handwashing started, \nbut it reduced the proportion of deaths to such a degree that you should be able to spot it!"}}
