I would assume this is due to the liberal government which was elected in 2015. \n#### Finally, we surprisingly found that Hungary is second on the top ten countries even though it is a European Union country with no armed conflicts. China is first, but the rejection rate for these two countries is very high. In the other hand countries like Syria and Iraq has a very high total positive outcome which make sense as the people of two countries are leaving due to the civil war and political unrest. \n","63a83a8a":"### The dataset has incomplete data for 2018, and some rows where the country is blank.

Positive:  \n                        * Positive: The  claimant is either a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.\n                        * Negative: The claimant is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection. \n                        * Other: A non-merit or administrative decision to close the case was made.
