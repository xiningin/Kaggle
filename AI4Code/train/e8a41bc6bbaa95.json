For example, it is often used in technical analysis of financial data, like stock prices, returns or trading volumes. \n[Source: Wikipedia](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Moving_average)\n\n\nBollinger Bands are a technical analysis tool developed by John Bollinger for generating oversold or overbought signals. \nThere are three lines that compose Bollinger Bands: A simple moving average (middle band) and an upper and lower band.\nFinancial traders employ these charts as a methodical tool to inform trading decisions, control automated trading systems, or as a component of technical analysis. Bollinger Bands display a graphical band (the envelope maximum and minimum of moving averages, similar to Keltner or Donchian channels) and volatility (expressed by the width of the envelope) in one two-dimensional chart.\n[Source: Wikipedia](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bollinger_Bands)","969a8e7a":"Lots of rows have NaN value. lets delete those","ad44f73e":"# Bollinger Bands\n\nIts an extension to the moving average of stock data and adding Bollinger Bands.","4456bbbe":"# Read the file"}}
