It is a part of Genome Assembly which you can read about at this post.\n\nThe similarity of the two given sequence may result of structural or evolutionary or functionality similarity.\n\n## How does a Genome Look?\nI will be using nucleotide sequencing of Coronavirus and try to compare it with a common existing virus like Human Rhinovirus A1.\n\nBelow is the example of Coronavirus Nucleotide:\n\n> cacgcagtat aattaataac taattactgt cgttgacagg acacgagtaa ctcgtctatc\n\nHere, cytosine (c) is followed by adenine (a) which is followed by a cytosine (c), which in turn is followed by a guanine (g), and so on.

For example, the similarity between sequences can used be in evolutionary analysis to find out what organisms share a common ancestor. Alternatively, the similarity between amino acid sequences can be used to predict the structure and functions of protein domains. Another use of pairwise sequence analysis is in genome sequencing assembly, where matches are used to find overlaps in the shorter pieces of DNA sequenced.
