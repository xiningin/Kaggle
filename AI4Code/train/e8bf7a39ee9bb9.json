For example, suppose that since this dataset was published, reviewer Kerin O'Keefe has changed her Twitter handle from `@kerinokeefe` to `@kerino`. One way to reflect this in the dataset is using the `replace` method:","4ea558d9":"A `DataFrame` or `Series` index has its own `dtype`, too:","ffbf3e16":"## Data types\n\nThe data type for a column in a `DataFrame` or a `Series` is known as the `dtype`.\n\nYou can use the `dtype` property to grab the type of a specific column:","34b027f7":"## Missing data\n\nEntries missing values are given the value `NaN`, short for \"Not a Number\".
