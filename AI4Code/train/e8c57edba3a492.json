These are the schools which require immediate help, as they are going to appear for SHSAT exam in the coming year, practising for the test might be more helpful to the students.\n\n* Similarly, for schools where students of Grade 5 & 6 who perform good (based on MATH and ELA) and have high percentage of minority students we have mapped these schools to centers of PASSNYC offering **after school** programs. The after school programs might help the students to clear the basic concepts and make them ready for SHSAT. \n\nIf worked on these schools and the minority students, we claim that this will increase the number of registrations for SHSAT, as they have higher percentage of minority students performing well and in turn will also increase the probablity of their selection, ultimately leading to the admissions which serves the purpose of increasing the diversity in the elite high schools.","6084cd00":"<h3><a id=\"6\">Analysing and mapping Schools based on School Performance Index<\/a><\/h3>\n\n![School Performance Indicator](https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/InFoCusp\/kaggle_images\/master\/School%20%20Performance%20%20Indicator.png)\n\n\nNext, we explore the 6 fields in the dataset which are indicative of the overall standing of the school.

The education space is full of non-profits like ours with limited resources. So the research question is, given limited resources, where (at which schools) can you target your intervention efforts to make an impact on those participation numbers. The hypothesis is that using what we know about students\/schools who do take the test, we can find similar students\/schools and rank them on their likelihood\/opportunity of converting into test-takers.\n\n<div style=\"text-align: right\">  Max B, Dataset Creator <\/div>\n\n\n\n*Submissions for the Main Prize Track will be judged based on the following general criteria:*\n* Performance - How well does the solution match schools and the needs of students to PASSNYC services? PASSNYC will not be able to live test every submission, so a strong entry will clearly articulate why it is effective at tackling the problem.\n* Influential - The PASSNYC team wants to put the winning submissions to work quickly. Therefore a good entry will be easy to understand and will enable PASSNYC to convince stakeholders where services are needed the most.\n* Shareable - PASSNYC works with over 60 partner organizations to offer services such as test preparation, tutoring, mentoring, extracurricular programs, educational consultants, community and student groups, trade associations, and more.

However, we have registrations\/offers data for 2017-18. So, the grade 6-7 students in the school dataset would be reflected in grade 7-8 of the registrations dataset. We searched for the 2016-17 registrations\/offers data in order to do the analysis in sync with the 2016 school dataset. However, we were unable to find any such dataset online. So, we moved forward with the data at hand. The schools dataset, if availale for current years, can be updated in the analysis. \n\nBelow, we present the summary of our findings: \n\n1. **Recommendations for Schools with high performing students** [schools with (low number of registrations + high minority students + high minority students performing well (based on ELA and MATH 4s))] - which should be targetted for SHSAT preparations\/ increasing number of registrations.\nWe also present proof that if these schools are targetted, it would lead to increase in the number of offers, thus increasing diversity of students enrolled in the elite schools.\n\n2. **Mapping of the above schools to PASSNYC help centers.**\n    \n   The help centers are categorized into 4 major categories : \n        Test preparation centers\n        After School centers\n        Economic help centers\n        Employment assistance centers (Also prevent students from engaging in criminal activities)\n\n    As the students of grade 8 & 9 are eligible for the exam, we have mapped the schools with high percentage of minority students whose performance is good (based on MATH and ELA in Grade 7 & 8) to test preparation centers of PASSNYC partners.  \n\n    Similarly, for schools where students of Grade 5 & 6 who perform well and have high percentage of minority students are mapped to PASSNYC offering after school program centers. \n    \n3. **Recommendations for Low performing schools on the basis of SPI - a combination of school performance parameters and Economic Need Index (ENI)**. <br>\nThese schools should be targetted an overall performance improvement over a longer run. If these schools are targetted, their performance could be improved which will result into increased number of registrations for SHSAT. PASSNYC should also setup SHSAT awareness programs in order to motivate the students and school in general, which definitely leads to increase in registrations. We have not mapped these schools with the 28 economic help centers of PASSNYC because financial aid can be provided from anywhere.\n\n4. **Mapping of the PASSNYC help centers has been done in two ways **: \n    \n    We mapped schools in need of PASSNYC services to the closest PASSNYC resource center and made clusters (based on colors as seen above). Using this technique, they can reach out to majority of schools quickly and with less burden. The goal was to reach out to majority of schools with minimum resources.\n\n    During EDA, we had found ideal locations for centrally located help centers which could serve multiple schools. However, we came across the already present help centers of PASSNYC partners and found that most of them were overlapping with our suggested locations. One additional location has been suggested by us, which can be setup as per the requirements of PASSNYC contributors.","2c647d52":"We can observe two things from the above analysis. \n*  One is that, the schools which have higher number of students not taking the test are located very near to the elite schools. \n* The second one being, that the students from the schools having 90% black \/ hispanic population on an average are the ones that are not taking the test.

Hence, we recommend that :\n\n* PASSNYC could help the school students by setting up centrally located resource centers which are common across schools. \n* In order to serve maximum schools using least resources, we have clustered the schools based on low SPI and high ENI.","0b53c7ef":"**Elite Eight Schools**  <br>\n\n**Now, let's understand why we were focusing on the black \/ hispanic people and why passnyc needs to look into schools with high black \/ hispanic ratio. <br><br>\n**First of all, <br>\nLet's load the data for the eight elite schools which gives admission on the basis of SHSAT and look at the geograhics of these schools.
