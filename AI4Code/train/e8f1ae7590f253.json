Mainstream, midage and young singles and couples are also more likely to pay more per packet of chips. This is indicative of impulse buying behaviour.\n\nWe\u2019ve also found that Mainstream young singles and couples are 23% more likely to purchase Tyrrells chips\ncompared to the rest of the population.\nThe Category Manager may want to increase the category\u2019s performance by off-locating some Tyrrells and smaller packs of chips in discretionary space near segmentswhere young singles and couples frequent more often to increase visibilty and impulse behaviour.\n\nQuantium can help the Category Manager with recommendations of where these segments are and further help them with measuring the impact of the changed placement. \n","ec84e3b4":"As part of Quantium\u2019s retail analytics team; your client, the Category Manager for Chips, who wants to better understand the types of customers who purchase Chips and their purchasing behaviour within the region.\nThe insights from your analysis will feed into the supermarket\u2019s strategic plan for the chip category in the next half year.","3753c849":"Transactions over time is plotted.
