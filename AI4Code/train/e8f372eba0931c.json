In the lungs, ACE2 is highly abundant on type 2 pneumocytes, an important cell type present in chambers within the lung called alveoli, where oxygen is absorbed and waste carbon dioxide is released.\n\nACE2 is a vital element in a biochemical pathway that is critical to regulating processes such as blood pressure, wound healing and inflammation, called the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) pathway.\n\nACE2 helps modulate the many activities of a protein called angiotensin II (ANG II) that increases blood pressure and inflammation.\n\nOf greatest relevance to COVID-19, ANG II can increase inflammation and the death of cells in the alveoli which are critical for bringing oxygen into the body. https:\/\/theconversation.com\/what-is-the-ace2-receptor-how-is-it-connected-to-coronavirus-and-why-might-it-be-key-to-treating-covid-19-the-experts-explain-136928","e9046013":"#Codes from Nitin Datta  https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/nitindatta\/finance-data-analysis","1cf1a37f":"#What is the ACE2 receptor, how is it connected to coronavirus and why might it be key to treating COVID-19?\n\nAuthors: Krishna Sriram: Postdoctoral Fellow, University of California San Diego \nPaul Insel: Professor of Pharmacology and Medicine, University of California San Diego \nRohit Loomba: Professor of Medicine, University of California San Diego \n\nIn the search for treatments for COVID-19, many researchers are focusing their attention on a specific protein that allows the virus to infect human cells. Called the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, or ACE2 \u201creceptor,\u201d the protein provides the entry point for the coronavirus to hook into and infect a wide range of human cells.\n\nACE2 is a protein on the surface of many cell types. It is an enzyme that generates small proteins \u2013 by cutting up the larger protein angiotensinogen \u2013 that then go on to regulate functions in the cell.\n\nUsing the spike-like protein on its surface, the SARS-CoV-2 virus binds to ACE2 \u2013 like a key being inserted into a lock \u2013 prior to entry and infection of cells. Hence, ACE2 acts as a cellular doorway \u2013 a receptor \u2013 for the virus that causes COVID-19. https:\/\/theconversation.com\/what-is-the-ace2-receptor-how-is-it-connected-to-coronavirus-and-why-might-it-be-key-to-treating-covid-19-the-experts-explain-136928","467bbcab":"Kaggle Notebook Runner: Mar\u00edlia Prata   @mpwolke","fd55b110":"#Codes from rossinEndrew https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/endrewrossin\/fast-initial-lightgbm-model-to-detect-exam-result\/comments","be8b2bc7":"#High expression of ACE2 receptor of 2019-nCoV on the epithelial cells of oral mucosa\n\nCitation: Xu, H., Zhong, L., Deng, J. et al.

Those findings have explained the basic mechanism that the oral cavity is a potentially high risk for 2019-nCoV infectious susceptibility and provided a piece of evidence for the future `prevention strategy in dental clinical practice` as well as daily life.\n\nThe expression and distribution of the ACE2 in human body may indicate the potential infection routes of 2019-nCoV. Through the developed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) technique and single-cell transcriptomes based on the public database, researchers analyzed the ACE2 RNA expression profile at single-cell resolution.\n\nHigh ACE2 expression was identified in type II alveolar cells (AT2) of lung, and many others. These findings indicated that those organs with high ACE2-expressing cells should be considered as potential high risk for 2019-nCoV infection.\n\nThe ACE2 could be expressed in the oral cavity, and was highly enriched in epithelial cells. Moreover, among different oral sites, ACE2 expression was higher in tongue than buccal and gingival tissues.

Drugs that inhibit the actions of ACE1 are called ACE inhibitors.\n\nExamples of these drugs are ramipril, lisinopril, and enalapril. These drugs block the actions of ACE1 but not ACE2. ACE1 drives the production of ANG II. In effect, ACE1 and ACE2 have a \u201cyin-yang\u201d relationship; ACE1 increases the amount of ANG II, whereas ACE2 reduces ANG II. \n\nBy inhibiting ACE1, ACE inhibitors reduce the levels of ANG II and its ability to increase blood pressure and tissue injury. ACE inhibitors are commonly prescribed for patients with hypertension, heart failure and kidney disease. \n\nA multidisciplinary group of investigators, has initiated a multicenter (randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled) clinical trial to examine the efficacy of ramipril - an ACE inhibitor - compared to a placebo in reducing mortality, ICU admission or need for mechanical ventilation in patients with COVID-19.https:\/\/theconversation.com\/what-is-the-ace2-receptor-how-is-it-connected-to-coronavirus-and-why-might-it-be-key-to-treating-covid-19-the-experts-explain-136928","d7c33ea0":"When the SARS-CoV-2 virus binds to ACE2, it prevents ACE2 from performing its normal function to regulate ANG II signaling. Thus, ACE2 action is \u201cinhibited,\u201d removing the brakes from ANG II signaling and making more ANG II available to injure tissues. This \u201cdecreased braking\u201d likely contributes to injury, especially to the lungs and heart, in COVID-19 patients. \n\nACE2 is present in all people but the quantity can vary among individuals and in different tissues and cells. Some evidence suggests that ACE2 may be higher in patients with hypertension, diabetes and coronary heart disease.\n\nA lack of ACE2 is associated with severe tissue injury in the heart, lungs and other tissue types. \n\nThe SARS-CoV-2 virus requires ACE2 to infect cells but the precise relationship between ACE2 levels, viral infectivity and severity of infection are not well understood.https:\/\/theconversation.com\/what-is-the-ace2-receptor-how-is-it-connected-to-coronavirus-and-why-might-it-be-key-to-treating-covid-19-the-experts-explain-136928","03e83019":"When the amount of ACE2 is reduced because the virus is occupying the receptor, individuals may be more susceptible to severe illness from COVID-19. That is because enough ACE2 is available to facilitate viral entry but the decrease in available ACE2 contributes to more ANG II-mediated injury. In particular, reducing ACE2 will increase susceptibility to inflammation, cell death and organ failure, especially in the heart and the lung.\n\nThe lungs are the primary site of injury by SARS-CoV-2 infection, which causes COVID-19. The virus reaches the lungs after entry in the nose or mouth.\n\nThe virus also impacts other tissues that express ACE2, including the heart, where damage and inflammation (myocarditis) can occur. The kidneys, liver and digestive tract can also be injured. Blood vessels may also be a site for damage. \n\nAbnormally high ANG II activity can be a key factor that determines severity of damage in patients with COVID-19.\nhttps:\/\/theconversation.com\/what-is-the-ace2-receptor-how-is-it-connected-to-coronavirus-and-why-might-it-be-key-to-treating-covid-19-the-experts-explain-136928"}}
