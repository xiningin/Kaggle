outliers\n- The 75 percentile of survivers fall below 50th percentile of dead people.","5caef2b9":"From the above picture\n- More number of people died in the age group of 45 to early 50's.\n- Majority of the patients are aged 40 to 60 andespecially the density is higher from 50 to around 54 hence more number of people are present in this age group followed by mid 40's to late 50's and so on.\n","8cf6e6ed":"We can note that\n- People with 0 nodes lived more than 5 years.\n- While the number of nodes increased the survival rate decreased and fatality rate increased.The more the nodes the less the chance of survival.\n- We can clearly tell that the fewer the nodes the more chance of survival.","b6e9a8df":"It can be infered that \n- About around 85% of people who have nodes < 5 survived.As number of nodes increases the chance of survial decreased.Death is iminent to the people having nodes >35.\n- We can also see that 96% of people have nodes <= 20.\n- 55% probability those have nodes<5 have survived less than 5 years.\n- About 85% of the people died within 5 years of the surgery with  5<nodes<20.","4165d4b9":"From the above we can say that \n- The minimum age of patient is 30 and maximum age is 83\n- The minimum number of nodes is 0 where as maximum number of nodes are 52\n- The time of recording this data was from 1958 to 1969","59fe472a":"- There is lot of densiy vesting at nodes 0 and less than 5 hence it can be concludes that majority of survived class peple have nodes leass than 5.","7ffa64cc":"From the above figure\n- People in their early 30's tends to survive more.\n- While those in their 40's,50's,60's and 70's have more death rate within 5 years of the surgery.\n- And as drawn an insight from the first scatter plot, people with age above ~75 did not survive.\n- There is a moajor overlap of the data which indicates that age does not carry enough data to conclude.","34fa1bf1":"Here we can observe that \n- A large number of people have nodes less than 10.\n- People with age from 30 to 40 have significantly low mortality rate when compared with other age groups and people above 80 cannot survive the cancer.\n- The age from 40 to 70 tends to more fatal (ofcourse there are also survivals) as more deaths are recorded within 5 years of surgery\n- There are very few cases recorded above 70 and as per the data and people above 80 died within 5 years of the surgery (there is only one recoding)\n- There are more people with age 40 to 60.\n- Very few patients have nodes greater than 20.","716dfb96":"### Conclusion:\n\n- The given data is not linearly seperable as it have overlaping of data points.\n- Upon the analysis we can conclude that number of nodes is the most determining factor for the survival rate regard less of the year operated.Age in assosiation can also be used but only with more valid data.","19a0f189":"From the pair plot we can observe that \n- age,nodes looks like determinig factors","fef4f6c6":"We can notice that\n- The operations made at initial years (~195 record more mortality than survival than later years.There are more failed operations resulting in deaths from around 1961 to 1963.From 1966 to 1967 there is again an increase in deaths.\n- Majority of the data is being overlapped.","ff103a91":"- The 50th percentiles or medians of both survived and dead looks like very close.\n- 50 percentile of the dead people are those who got operaqted from '56 to around '63.\n","a4949cd1":"### As the classes cannot be seperated easily because of overlapping I am seperating survived and dead classes seperatly.\n","cb7016fa":"From boxplot we can observe that\n- The majority of the people who survived lies with in age group of around 43 and 60.\n- The majority of people who were scumbed to death lies in age group of arount 46 to 61.\n","ac7882bc":"From the above violin charts we can observe that\n- The deaths peaked for people in their mid 40's and 50's.\n- People who got operated during '59 and '60 have survived more while those who got operated during mid of 1962 to 1965 have seen an exponential rise in deaths.\n- The operations done from mid of 1957 to around 1958 tends to have raise in number of deaths and then the death rate raised again from mid of 1962 to around 1964\n- A majority of people with 0 and 1 node have survived while few of them died with in 5 years despite undergoing a surgery.\n- A mojor portion of the people are in age group mid 40's to their 60's.\n- With the increase in no:of nodes the survival rate decreased significantly while few people survived even with more number of nodes.\n- I think it is almost impossible to set a treshold for age,year with survival as most of the data overlaps with each other.","41563044":"Here we can observe that \n- A large number of people have nodes less than 10.\n- People with age from 30 to 40 have low mortality rate when compared with other age groups and people above 80 cannot survive the cancer.\n- The age from 40 to 70 tends to more fatal (ofcourse there are also survivals) as more deaths are recorded within 5 years of surgery\n- There are very few cases recorded above 70 and as per the data people above 80 died within 5 years of the surgery (there is only one recoding)\n- It's not clear as most of the opints are overlapping.\nLets explore more","ff0406c7":"What we can observe from above plot is that \n- There are more number of surviours than deaths.","bc626bf5":"We can see that \n- Majority portion of the people belongs to 40's and 50's.\n- There are very few people in their 70's"}}
