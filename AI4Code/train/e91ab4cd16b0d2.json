The [Resnets paper](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1512.03385) states that CIFAR-10(20 layered) has a better accuracy than CIFAR-10(56 layered) which is absurd since our 56 layered is deeper, so will Resnet18 will work better than Resnet34?\n\nDo deeper neural networks produce better results?\nCheck out the other the other notebook I coded about this model using Resnet34.\n\nAnyway, so lets train the data:","cafe6c75":"Well, I did try and here we are with an accuracy of 97.3%, and a couple of correct prediction from amongst some hundreds of classes.\n\n* Concluding: \nFastAI makes everything super easy and you should checkout the Library.\n\n* Shameless SelfPromotion:\nDo upvote if you found this helpful and felt motivated! :D","586a5f16":"Lets finally predict:","d70c357e":"> Welcome to my notebook where I solely use FastAI library which is built on top of Pytorch to showcase how to get things done with a few lines of code."}}
