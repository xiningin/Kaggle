One possible reason for this is that the learning rate might be too high. It's possible that the model's paramaters are \"bouncing\" around the optimal set of parameters that have the lowest loss. You can try reducing the learning rate and training for a few more epochs to see if it helps.\n\nThe more likely reason that **the model just isn't powerful enough**. If you remember our initial hypothesis, we have assumed that the output (in this case the class probabilities) is a **linear function** of the input (pixel intensities), obtained by perfoming a matrix multiplication with the weights matrix and adding the bias. This is a fairly weak assumption, as there may not actually exist a linear relationship between the pixel intensities in an image and the digit it represents. While it works reasonably well for a simple dataset like MNIST (getting us to 85% accuracy), we need more sophisticated models that can capture non-linear relationships between image pixels and labels for complex tasks like recognizing everyday objects, animals etc. \n","bd3598cd":"Now we'll define an `evaluate` function, which will perform the validation phase, and a `fit` function which will peform the entire training process.","ba894cfe":"A commonly used loss function for classification problems is the **cross entropy**, which has the following formula:\n\n![cross-entropy](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/VDRDl1D.png)\n\nWhile it looks complicated, it's actually quite simple:\n\n* For each output row, pick the predicted probability for the correct label. E.g. if the predicted probabilities for an image are `[0.1, 0.3, 0.2, ...]` and the correct label is `1`, we pick the corresponding element `0.3` and ignore the rest.\n\n* Then, take the [logarithm](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Logarithm) of the picked probability. If the probability is high i.e. close to 1, then its logarithm is a very small negative value, close to 0. And if the probability is low (close to 0), then the logarithm is a very large negative value. We also multiply the result by -1, which results is a large postive value of the loss for poor predictions.\n\n* Finally, take the average of the cross entropy across all the output rows to get the overall loss for a batch of data.\n\nUnlike accuracy, cross-entropy is a continuous and differentiable function that also provides good feedback for incremental improvements in the model (a slightly higher probability for the correct label leads to a lower loss). This makes it a good choice for the loss function. \n\nAs you might expect, PyTorch provides an efficient and tensor-friendly implementation of cross entropy as part of the `torch.nn.functional` package. Moreover, it also performs softmax internally, so we can directly pass in the outputs of the model without converting them into probabilities.","330ce0db":"While the accuracy does continue to increase as we train for more epochs, the improvements get smaller with every epoch. This is easier to see using a line graph.","8509e177":"Inside the `__init__` constructor method, we instantiate the weights and biases using `nn.Linear`. And inside the `forward` method, which is invoked when we pass a batch of inputs to the model, we flatten out the input tensor, and then pass it into `self.linear`.\n\n`x.reshape(-1, 28*28)` indicates to PyTorch that we want a *view* of the `x` tensor with two dimensions, where the length along the 2nd dimension is 28\\*28 (i.e. 784). One argument to `.reshape` can be set to `-1` (in this case the first dimension), to let PyTorch figure it out automatically based on the shape of the original tensor.\n\nNote that the model no longer has `.weight` and `.bias` attributes (as they are now inside the `.linear` attribute), but it does have a `.parameters` method which returns a list containing the weights and bias, and can be used by a PyTorch optimizer.","41643f81":"The initial accuracy for one epoch or one iteration is around 10%, which is what one might expect from a randomly intialized model (since it has a 1 in 10 chance of getting a label right by guessing randomly). \n\nWe are now ready to train the model.
