World stock markets were down substantially. This is probably why this day has the largest overall trading volume. BAC and AAPL were the two most traded stocks of the day.**\n\n**2. Volume tends to be highest on Fridays and lowest on Mondays. Monday is the first day of the week so factors such as investors' moods being gloomy on going back to work and due to the large amounts of bad news released in the weekends cause people to trade less on this day.**\n\n**3. Amazon saw the most volatility on 2017-06-09. It was a Friday and as it was the last day of the week, people might have sold more shares than purchased, so price fell substantially. We can tell this as the lowest price that day was much lower than lowest price of previous day whereas highest price was quite the same.**\n\n**4. NVIDIA's closing price on 1\/2\/2014 was only 15.86 and it's closing price on 12\/29\/2017 was 193.5. I am unsure if these prices are really accurate but according to the dataset, in about 6 years, the percentage gain was colossal (1120%). Also, NVIDIA is one of the largest GPU creators in the world. So if anyone had the ability to go back in time, they should really consider investing in this stock.**","9e9bb8ea":"# Data Visualization and Analysis","c717909f":"**2017-06-09 was the date AMZN had the highest volatility (highest difference between high and low price).**","fec69587":"**Question 2: On which day of the week does volume tend to be highest?
