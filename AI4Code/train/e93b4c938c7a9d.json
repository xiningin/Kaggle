explored using a different methods of Regression. For each method,\nan algorithm was developped to predict the meter readings, representing energy output, using characteristics of the building, use, location, and weather.\nTo begin with, a linear regression model was applied and achieved a low accuracy score of less than 0.01%, and R2 score of less than 0.01%. This suggested that a linear regression model was an extremely poor model for predicting energy usage.\n\nThen a decision tree was applied at different depths. At a depth of 2, the R2 value increased to almost 15%, but at a depth of 5, the R2 jumped to over 82%. At the mean time, the accuracy score was changed from 0.147 to 0.723 as the treee depth increased from 2 to 5. This suggested a strong fit for our \u201cDecision Tree Regression\u201d model. However, a closer look at the data showed that the results were skewed towards high square feet, which only represented a small percentage of overall data.\n\nOn the basis of results from decision tree, a Random Forest regression was applied, which gave an accuracy score of 96%, which was higher than previous models. This can be explained by the theory that random forest was serveal combinations of decision tree. In Random forest tree model, there were more trees and depth for modeling and splitting.\n\nUltimately a model was implemented that had a high accuracy rate of predicting the energy use using a Random Forest Regression model. The more important variables accounted for the seasonality (month), site location (air_temperature), and characteristics of the building itself (square feet and meter).\n\nOur conclusion is that a random forest model is a strong model to predict energy readings, and more exploration needs to be done on the variables that were considered more important in this model.\n\nIf anyone interested in visualization of decision tree, let me know as the code did not work here due to separate package needed to be installed.\n\n","66bd60df":"The connection between building_meta and train dataset is building_id while building_meta dataset can merge with weather_train dataset on site_id.\n\nSo basically building_id was the primary key and site_id was the foreign key for the building_meta table\n\nbuilding_id was primary key for train dataset while site_id was primary key for weather_train dataset.","fb7b2d84":"Data attributes summary\n\nQuick view of the data attributes statistics presented in the Table 2.

The goal is to develop models from ASHRAE\u2019s 2016 data in order to better understand metered building energy usage in the following areas: chilled water, electric, hot water, and steam meters. The data comes from over 1,000 buildings over a one-year timeframe. The method chosen to solve the problem is Linear Regression.\n    \n\n### Introduction:\nAs the impact of climate change is being felt more increasingly, organizations are looking for ways to lower their energy footprint. Our organization (Greentech Inc) has developed technology to provide highly efficient heating and cooling systems that operate at much lower energy consumption.\n\nWe have partnered with governments across the world to retrofit the highest energy users with significant subsidies from our government partners. Highest energy users are defined as those with the highest energy consumption as determined by their energy meter readings.\n\nBy starting with the highest energy consumption users, we can prioritize our resources to provide the greatest impact, ultimately resulting in reduced energy consumption and a more environmentally friendly solution.\n\n    \n    \n### Background:\nThe four dataset presented in (Kaggle ASHRAE Energy Predictor III dataset) are related to ASHRAE -  Energy  Predictor III.\n\nAs a specific purpose of lab assignment, we are looking at Linear Regression problem using ASHRAE -Energy Predictor III dataset.

The weight given to \u201cmeter\u2019 is understandable, as it was shown in a box plot earlier that the \u201cmeter\u201d type influenced the \u2018meter readings\u2019, specifically for higher values.\n\nBecause of the high skew towards larger \u2018Square feet\u2019 values, we don\u2019t believe that the Decision tree model is an accurate model to use, despite the higher R2 value.\n","6de697f4":"From desicion tree, square feet under 333282.5, meter is electricity, month from January to June, air temperature under 4.488 result in 81 samples point showing 276450653 and 63 samples showing 68649752 for meter reading.","7cfcfc56":"\nHere column 'primaty_use' was treated by get_dummies function","71037ff5":"Checking unique elements in primary use column within building_meta table.","252dbff1":"For depth 2 desicion tree modeling, R2 was obtained at 0.147","752f1676":"We wanted to take a bit more of a look at \"sea level pressure\", \"cloud coverage\", \"air temperature\", \"wind speed\" and \"precip_depth_1hr\" to get a better idea of how the values are spread out.
