Scikit-learn uses plain Ordinary Least Squares method to solve this problem.\n\n#### Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)\nOLS is a method for estimating the unknown parameters in a linear regression model. OLS chooses the parameters of a linear function of a set of explanatory variables by minimizing the sum of the squares of the differences between the target dependent variable and those predicted by the linear function. In other words, it tries to minimizes the sum of squared errors (SSE) or mean squared error (MSE) between the target variable (y) and our predicted output ($\\hat{y}$) over all samples in the dataset.\n\nOLS can find the best parameters using of the following methods:\n    - Solving the model parameters analytically using closed-form equations\n    - Using an optimization algorithm (Gradient Descent, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Newton\u2019s Method, etc.)","8de2f4e1":"Lets select some features that we want to use for regression.","6ce766cd":"__Did you know?__ When it comes to Machine Learning, you will likely be working with large datasets.
