Although we would prefer to have as many features as we can in the hope of getting a reasonably accurate model, it is often the case that the variance in target is better explained by only a subset of the features. I will perform feature selection of catgorical features based on mutual information between the features and target to see if it leads to any improvement in model performance over using all the features. ","6b98bf8e":"# Problem description\n\nIn this challenge, we have to predict a binary target using a number of continuous and categorical features.

It is important to minimize or eliminate multicollinearity as it undermines the statistical power of the model. \n\nTo identify the degree of multi-collinearity in the data, I will use Variance Inflation Factor. VIF is equal to the ratio of the overall model variance to the variance of a model that includes only a single independent variable. This ratio is calculated for each independent variable. A high VIF indicates that the associated independent variable is highly collinear with the other variables in the model. A VIF of 1 indicates that the two variables are not correlated, 5 indicates moderate collinearity and 10 indicates high collinearity. I would try to achieve a VIF score below 10 for the remaining features after removing some highly correlated features.","fba060b1":"# CatBoostClassifier","17d6cca5":"# Continuous features\n\nThere are 11 continous features.

Let's see how the results may vary when we use only 14 features instead of the initial 30 features."}}
