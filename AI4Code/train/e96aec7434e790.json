Split the dataset into training and testing dataset. The testing dataset is generally smaller than training one as it will help in training the model better.\n 2.

We use the **.fit()** method\n 4. Then pass the testing data to the trained algorithm to predict the outcome. We use the **.predict()** method.\n 5. We then check the accuracy by **passing the predicted outcome and the actual output** to the model.","c5830dab":"As we can see that the Petal Features are giving a better cluster division compared to the Sepal features.

In the following dataset, the attributes are the petal and sepal length and width. It is also known as **Features**.\n\n**Target variable**, in the machine learning context is the variable that is or should be the output.

","c7024462":"### Now the given problem is a classification problem.. Thus we will be using the classification algorithms to build a model.\n**Classification**: samples belong to two or more classes and we want to learn from already labeled data how to predict the class of unlabeled data\n\n**Regression**: if the desired output consists of one or more continuous variables, then the task is called regression. An example of a regression problem would be the prediction of the length of a salmon as a function of its age and weight.","ab8e4f30":"Now, when we train any algorithm, the number of features and their correlation plays an important role.
