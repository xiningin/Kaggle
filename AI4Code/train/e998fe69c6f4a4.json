Lien status is determined by reference to the best information readily available to the lender at the time final action is taken and to the lender's own procedures. Lien status aids in the interpretation of price data. For more information on lien status, see the HMDA Price Data Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) section of the following link: http:\/\/www.federalreserve.gov\/newsevents\/press\/bcreg\/20060403a.htm","b7f880d3":"**Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA)**\n\n\nThe Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) was enacted by Congress in 1975 and was implemented by the Federal Reserve Board's Regulation C. On July 21, 2011, the rule-writing authority of Regulation C was transferred to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). Regulation C, requires lending institutions to report public loan data. In this section of the website, you can find out more about the regulation and its interpretation.\n\nThe primary purposes of the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and Regulation C are to monitor the geographic targets of mortgage lenders, provide an identification mechanism for any predatory lending practices and to provide reporting statistics on the mortgage market to the government. The HMDA helps to support the community investment initiatives sponsored by government programs, with HMDA contributing to the oversight of the initiatives through statistical reporting. HMDA also helps government officials to identify any predatory lending practices which may be affecting mortgage loan issuance. HMDA submissions also provide a means for analyzing government resource allocations and ensuring that resources are appropriately allocated to fund community initiatives.(from -Investopedia)"}}
