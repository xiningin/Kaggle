If not, we will drop them. Also, 'Man of the Match' depends, as per data, on goal scored. A player from good team should be capable enough to score high. So, team branding turns out to be an important factor. In our data, there is no way to identify each team brand value.\n- I believe 'Round' should also not have any impact on 'Man of the Match' because, a player performance should be consistent over all matches to become man of the match than just in a particular round.

In R use the corr function and in python this can by accomplished by using numpy's corrcoef function.\n    \n    Multicolinearity on the other hand is more troublesome to detect because it emerges when three or more variables, which are highly correlated, are included within a model. To make matters worst multicolinearity can emerge even when isolated pairs of variables are not colinear. Multi-collinearity is an important pipeline steps fpr \n\n- Steps for Implementing VIF\n    - Run a multiple regression.\n    - Calculate the VIF factors.\n    - Inspect the factors for each predictor variable, if the VIF is between 5-10, multicolinearity is likely present and you should consider dropping the variable.","b4f6c68e":"***If you found the content informative to any extend, kindly encourge me by upvoting. :)***","48561b47":"- These features have least or no correlation with 'Man of the Match'\n    - ['Blocked', 'OffSides', 'Saves','Distance Covered (Kms)', 'Yellow & Red', '1st Goal', 'Goals in PSO']\n    - These features will not have impact on aur analysis and thus, holding them or retaining them is our choice\n    - We will see what to do with these later","d034225d":"## Load Libraries","8a8d0553":"- 'Man of the Match' is highly correlated with 'Goal Scored', 'On-Target', 'Corners', 'Attempts', 'free Kicks', 'Yellow Card', 'red', 'Fouls Committed', 'Own goal Time'\n- OWn goal time is twins of 'Ball possession %', and Passes, pass Accuracy\n- Pass HCW Pass Accuracy %\n- passes SCW 'Ball possession %\n- Passes HCW 'Attempts'\n- Goals in PSO SCW DIstance Covered (Kms)\n\n- Correlated columns needs to be removed to avoid multicollinearity.
