employee attrition rate i.e. preventing the reduction of staff(voluntary resigning or laid off by the company). If the HR dept is unable to do so,\n\n- The former employees\u2019 projects get delayed, which makes it difficult to meet timelines, resulting in a reputation loss among consumers and partners\n\n- A sizeable department has to be maintained, for the purposes of recruiting new talent\n\n- More often than not, the new employees have to be trained for the job and\/or given time to acclimatise themselves to the company\n\nA large company named XYZ, employs, at any given point of time, around 4000 employees. However, every year, around 15% of its employees leave the company and need to be replaced with the talent pool available in the job market.\n\nThe management of the company has contracted an HR analytics firm to understand what factors they should focus on, in order to curb attrition. In other words, they want to know what changes they should make to their workplace, in order to get most of their employees to stay. Also, they want to know which of these variables is most important and needs to be addressed right away.\n\nPlaying the role of a Lead Data Analyst in the firm, this project has been assigned to me.\nJoin me as I tread on this journey of exploration and attempt to figure out the main causes behind the attrition rate of company XYZ.\n\n\n\n","e4c058c1":"Often every now and then, under the esteemed columns of our newspapers, we get to read about how millenials are picky about minute aspects of the company and shuffle around alot.\n\nIt would only make sense for us to look into this claim and see how Exposure to other work culture of other companies influences the retention of a Employee at XYZ","9144bf36":"The attrition rate of the company XYZ (<b><i>17.78%<\/i><\/b>) is very high considering the ideal attrition rate is <b><i>10%<\/i><\/b> and it is also significantly higher than the global average of <b><i>11.2%<\/i><\/b>.
