I filtered the measurements for the lowest wind speed days in order to calculate the emissions factor for the power plants.  However, this approach excludes a large proportion of the available data.  A pollution transport simulation model which can trace the movement of pollutants back to original sources would be useful for quantifying the total pollutants emitted by a power plant.  This type of model could also be used to evaluate the residence time of $NO_2$ in a grid cell.  This would be particularly useful for calculating higher temporal resolution, months or weeks, emissions factors. I used a much higher wind speed threshold to calculate the monthly emissions factors because the coverage area was too low using a low wind speed threshold. \n\n\n$NO_{2_{Sentinel}} = NO_{2_{powerplants}} + NO_{2_{vehicles}} + NO_{2_{silage}}$ - $NO_{2_{wind}}$\n\n\nOzone is generated when $NO_2$ reacts with VOCs on hot sunny days.

I will regrid the data to 0.01 degree latitude by 0.01 degree longitude grid cells for Puerto Rico which is approximately 1 km x 1 km.  Grid cells will be divided based on primary sources of $NO_2$.  Grid cells with agriculture will be excluded from analyses in order exclude the potential effects of $NO_2$ from silage which is outside the scope of the objectives.  Grid cells without power plants or agriculture will be used to build a predictive model for $NO_2$ emissions from motor vehicles in a grid cell.  Then the predictive model will be used to predict the $NO_2$ emissions from motor vehicles in grid cells with power plants.  The $NO_2$ emissions from motor vehicles can then be subtracted from the total $NO_2$ emissions measured by the satellite to get the $NO_2$ emissions produced by the power plant.  These $NO_2$ emissions can then be used to calculate the emissions factor.  \n\nThere are many assumptions with this method.  \n\nThere is an assumption that all $NO_2$ emissions in grid cells without power plants and agriculture comes from motor vehicles. \n\nThere is an assumption that there is little advection of $NO_2$ from the grid cells near power plants.  I filter the data for the days with the lowest wind speeds but there is still advection. \n\nThere is an assumption that the residence time for $NO_2$ is approximately 1 day. However, the residence time of $NO_2$ varies over time depending on local environmental conditions.  If the residence time is less than 1 day, the emissions will be under estimated. Whereas, if the residence time is more than 1 day , the emissions will be over estimated.

The $NO_{2}$ data from the sensors on the Sentinel 5P OFFL satellite are a combination of emissions from all of these sources. In mathematical terms:  \n\n$NO_{2_{Sentinel}} = NO_{2_{powerplants}} + NO_{2_{vehicles}} + NO_{2_{silage}}$ \n\nThe objective is to calculate an emissions factor for power plants.  In order to achieve this objective, the fraction of emissions measured by the sensor must be attributed to power plants. Power plant emissions are difficult to attribute because of the variability in the characteristics of power plants, which use different types of fuels, have different pollution scrubbers, and have fluctuating emissions depending on demand. \n\n$NO_{2}$ emissions from motor vehicles are less impacted by the emissions from any individual vehicle. Therefore, the collective emissions across many vehicles can be generalized as long as there are no contributions from power plants or silage. \n\n$NO_{2_{vehicles}} = NO_{2_{Sentinel}}$ \n\nwhere $NO_{2_{powerplants}} = 0$ and $NO_{2_{silage}} = 0$\n\nSilage describes the process of fermenting green foliage crops to be used for animal feed.  $NO_{2}$ emissions from silage occur in agricultural areas and have a seasonal component depending on the harvesting patterns of a geographic area.  For the purposes of this analysis, I will make the assumption that grid cells with power plants do not have large agricultural operations.    \n\nTherefore, $NO_2$ from powerplants would be calculated as: \n\n$NO_{2_{powerplants}} = NO_{2_{Sentinel}} - NO_{2_{vehicles}}$\n\nwhere $NO_{2_{silage}} = 0$\n\nReference:   \n<sup>1<\/sup>https:\/\/toxtown.nlm.nih.gov\/chemicals-and-contaminants\/nitrogen-oxides","54f08b13":"**It is possible to calculate marginal emissions factors.

I calculated the percentage of the estimated_generation_gwh for the coal power plant relative to the total generation for Puerto Rico and found that coal is estimated to generate 92% of the power for Puerto Rico. Therefore, I would expect $NO_2$ emissions for coal to be much higher. I also estimated the fraction of coal compared to the total capacity and found it to be 7% of the total capacity.

As more data are collected by the satellite sensor over time, additional analyses can be done to analyze seasonal patterns and trends in $NO_2$ emissions over longer periods of time.  Marginal emissions factors were also calculated but were highly variable and need further investigation.\n\nThe benefit of using a satellite sensor to calculate emissions factors is that data are collected over large geographic areas making it possible to calculate emissions factors over spatial and temporal scales that otherwise would not be possible.  The drawback is that there are many sources of $NO_2$ and attributing the emissions to power plants will have measurement errors that vary with local environmental conditions.   \n\n**All these calculations of emissions factors need validation.** \n","c7c67b28":"I also calculated monthly averages but the threshold filter for wind speed had to be considerably higher to get adequate geographic coverage for a month.

The Global Power Plant Database includes power generation for invdividual power plants when it is available.  \n\nPuerto Rico is an island so there are some unique challenges with measuring emissions in coastal areas where many power plants are located along the land-sea margin.  For example, gldas data are only available for land and did not cover all the areas with power plants in Puerto Rico without extending the data set to surrounding grid cells. Coastal areas also tend to experience daily wind events which advect $NO_2$ emissions away from source grid cells. Therefore, calculating emissions for a region that is not influenced by coastal weather patterns would also be beneficial for evaluating the methodology.
