The following quick hack works quite well: replace the J-coupled atoms based on this dictionary: `{\"H\":\"He\",\"C\":\"Be\",\"N\":\"B\"}`. This tricks the visualizer into substituting differently colored spheres for the atoms in question. There must be a better way for this but this is the best I've got.\n\n**Don't attempt this with actual molecules in the lab because, at best, it won't work. In the worst case, you may hurt yourself. And wear protective goggles at all times if you do still want to try this despite my warning.**","22eadc05":"Below is the function that visualizes a molecule and colors the two atoms (optional). It uses row index from train dataframe to get molecule name and the J-coupled atom locations.","84c93426":"Here comes my quick and dirty hack to color two atoms that are J-coupled. J-coupled atoms are replaced based on the dictionary: `{\"H\":\"He\",\"C\":\"Be\",\"N\":\"B\"}`. This is chemically absurd but it happens to work for this visualization. Compare this visualization with the above molecule to see the new color scheme for J-coupled atoms in question: 'H' ='light blue', 'C' = 'light green', 'N' = 'pinkish tan'. The replaced atoms are of slightly different sizes: 'H' is slightly undersized, 'C' and 'N' are slightly oversized. This does not pose any obvious problems and, in any case, I did not find better size replacements.","c5f3e559":"Finally, let's put everything into something that **ase** can process.
