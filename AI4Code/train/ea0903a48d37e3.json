There are two possible values for this field: 'numerical' or 'categorical'. By 'numerical' we mean variables for which the values are numbers, and by 'categorical' we mean variables for which the values are categories\n\nCategory - Identification of the variables category . We can define three possible segments: building, space or location. When we say 'building', we mean a variable that relates to the physical characteristics of the building (e.g. 'OverallQual'). When we say 'space', we mean a variable that reports space properties of the house (e.g. 'TotalBsmtSF'). Finally, when we say a 'location', we mean a variable that gives information about the place where the house is located (e.g. 'Neighborhood')\n\nExpected Effect on Sale Price - Our expectation about the variable influence in 'SalePrice'. We can use a categorical scale with 'High', 'Medium' and 'Low' as possible values. We can look at each variable and try to understand their meaning and relevance\n\nCorrelation Coefficient - Consist of correlation cofficient value for numerical variable\n\nConclusion - Our conclusions about the importance of the variable, after we give a quick look at the data and cofficenent\n\nNote - Any general comments realted to variables","0cc417bb":"For 'TotalBsmtSF' only one outlier was there which was at index '1298' and same got deleted with 'GrLivArea'.\n\nNow For 'GarageCars' on looking at graph we can say when 'GarageCars' value is 4 then sale price is dropped and does not follow the trend , so we will drop the rows where Garage car value is 4","ea6e3e26":"With these plots we can see that out of three categorical variables only 'OverallQual' is having linear relationship with 'SalePrice'(When Quality increase Sales Price also increase) and other two variables i.e. 'Neighborhood' and 'ExtCond' does not show any linear relationship.

I tried to explain everything as simple and straightforward to my best wisdom.\n\nI have tried different model and submitted score based of all models , in this way we can see different models\/approach and how to fine tune them. With the latest model score is **0.16303**\n\nPlease provide comment if you have any kind of suggestions ao that I can improve this kernel and if you like in someway then please upvote the kernel.\n\n**Note** : *This is Work In Progress Notebook , will be updating on regular basis till the time will get good model and satisfactory scores.*","0b299fd1":"# About the Kernel","303d22c8":"# 8.

It means there is a scope of remodelling here.\nLet's get some statistics related to this model","02d87b71":"Mean Accuracy is coming close to 76% and standard Devaition is also not that much (~8.4%) , but our score with this model is ~ 0.50 we need to improve this\nWe need to try another mode  , let's try with Random Forest Regression Model","b6475b80":"Now we can see there is no missing value in test data set , let's deal with outliers now.","76626fb3":"# 8.

But due to high correlation cofficent numbers let's consider them now , and these variables are\n'FullBath','1stFlrSF',\n'YearRemodAdd','GarageCars','GarageArea'\n\nOn checking data description and correlation coffecient it looks like that 'YearRemodAdd'\/\/'YearBuilt' , 'TotalBsmtSF' \/\/'1stFlrSF' ,'GarageCars'\/\/'GarageArea' variables are kind of identical variables only .If we practially think about these variables, we can conclude that they give almost the same information so multicollinearity can occurs\nSo we can consider only 'FullBath','GarageCars' in new list and ignore the remaining of them","90b3be4b":"Let's import the data and check columns data type and total records"}}
