After finding them, it checks their classification -whether they are let say man or women, good or bad, normal or abnormal- and our point's classification will be the dominant one. (For example: There are 3 woman points and 1 man points close to our input point. (3+1) = 4 is our neighbour value. Our point's classification will be no doubt \"woman\", since it is the dominant one). ","d28972a3":"**INTRODUCTION**\n* In this kernel, I've demonstrated the KNN Classification to a biomechanical dataset. As you can see, I didn't go into details; so just some visualizations, dataset normalization and finally the KNN Classification.\n* There are 2 csv files in our dataset, but I've just used one of them. \n* Each dataset contains 6 columns which are represeting patients' biomechanical features.","b032cc41":"**1) Deal With Data**\n* In this part, I've manipulated the data set, so that make things clear.
