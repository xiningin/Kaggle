The model looks to answer the question of how the total points of an NBA game depends on the total number of steals and assists (assists - turnovers). Real NBA box scores data was pulled from Kaggle (https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/pablote\/nba-enhanced-stats). ","d64d8374":"Next I wanted to implement a better model by implementing the numbers of shots in a game (shots attempted (FGA) - shots made (FGM))."}}
