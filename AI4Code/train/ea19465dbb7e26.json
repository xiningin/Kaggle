In the late 1980s, Hindi cinema experienced a period of stagnation due to increasing violence, decline in musical melodic quality, and rise in video piracy, leading to middle-class family audiences abandoning theatres.\n\nThe turning point came with the musical romance Chandni (1989). It was instrumental in ending the era of violent action films in Indian Cinema and rejuvenating the romantic musical genre. It also set a new template for Bollywood musical romance films that defined Hindi cinema in the coming years.\n\nReference: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cinema_of_India#New_Bollywood_(1990s%E2%80%93present)\n\nStarting from the 2000 it is growing with a much higher rate. Partly, it could be connected to the growing population of India.\nhttp:\/\/statisticstimes.com\/demographics\/population-of-india.php\n\nDigital age has probably also had its effect on the movie production speed.","d9e2ced2":"The most common words used in the plot column for Indian movies are:\n\n* father\n* mother\n* friend\n* son\n* family\n* house\n* love\n* kill\n* life\n* find\n\nFrom this quick analysis it seems like family is an important value in India (which is a common knowledge about Indian culture). So it is logical that movies are filmed around this topic. Important words include also \"kill\", \"life\" and \"find\". From that we can conclude that genres like \"detective\", \"thriller\", \"crime\", \"drama\" are going to be the most popular among Indian audience.\n\nNow let's see in reality which genres are the most popular in this dataset. We will perform this analysis for the 2 leaders - The US and India - to be able to compare the results with our predictions drawn from the word clouds. As there are 2265 genres in the dataset, first we will identify 20 most common ones.","01ca2632":"The most frequent genre is \"unknown\", probably due to some data collection issues. Unfortunately, this subset of the dataframe is not very useful for our purpose, so we can disregard it for now. However, in case of creating a machine learning algorithm that predicts the genre of a movie, this data can be used to test the final working model on some real data.\n\nNow, let's make a heatmap that shows which movie genre of the top 20 genres is the most popular in different countries.\n\np.s. As the genre data is quite messy, before creating a ML model it should be cleaned\/preprocessed in a way that we identify all the existing genre categories and label each row of the dataset with these categories.","7cc98f94":"We can see that all the 4 leaders have started producing moves much earlier than most of other countries. This partly explains such a big difference in the numbers.\n\n# The US\n\nIf we look at **the US numbers**, we see that the movie industry was developping progressivly until the 1960-s. During the next 20 years there was a decline and then it started to grow again.\nThis decline is explained in this article: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/New_Hollywood\n\nIn short, the advent of television and the much changed audience demographics (yonger generation) have put an end to the \"Old Hollywood\" and \"The New Hollywood\" was only starting to develop.\n\nAnother reason for a much faster growth of the American movie industry in the past 20 years could be the beginning of the digital age that made making movies cheaper and much faster.\n\nNow let's take a closer look at the Indian movie industry.","67a78ec6":"As we can see, most of the data is categorical, so we will need to take that into consideration when deciding on the plots to choose for this datset.\n\nNow let's get the basic information about this dataset.","7aaf730c":"### Top directors","19078b98":"As we can see, in **the US the most popular genres** are \"drama\", \"comedy\", \"horror\", \"western\" and \"adventure\". Except for the genre of \"comedy\" (which I guess is hard to predict from just a wordcloud), our prediction is in line with the reality.\n\nFor **the Indian data**, most information about the genres is missing, so it is much more difficult to see the real picture but we see that \"drama\" and \"comedy\" also prevail. Same situation we can observe in the British movie data.\n\n# Top directors and cast\nIn the end, let's see who is the most efficient director that produced most movies, and the most popular cast choice.\n\nWe will remove the \"Unknown\" director and null cast values to make the analysis clearer.\nAlso, while analizing the Cast data, we noticed a few small issues. First, the same cast character was named in 2 different ways: \"Three Stooges\" and \"The Three Stooges\". It influenced the data reflexion, so we fixed it merging the two. Second, while removing the null cast values, we noticed there are not only null values but also non-breaking spaces in some rows of the data, so we removed them as well.","b7b403ae":"# Visualize the data\n### Movie ndustry trend\n\nFirst, let's see the overall trend in the movie production industry over a century.","4f5c8263":"This way it is much easier to analyse the data as there are fewer categories.\n\nNow we can see that the second place belongs to **India**, producing twice as less movies in total over the century than the US.\nIt is followed by **the Great Britain** and **Japan**, having much lower movie production than the 2 leaders.","dd2a8e6d":"# Conclusion\n\n* In this analysis we've discovered that the Wikipedia Movie Plots dataset contains massive data (~35k movies). It could be an advantage when considering to create a Genre prediction model or a Recommendation system.\n* The overall tendency of the world movie production industry is near exponential growth which is lead by the US and India, followed by the Great Britain and Japan.\n* We've looked more closely into the reasons of such growth in the US and India.\n* We've explored the most popular movie genres of this dataset and tried to predict most frequent genres for the US and India based on the word clouds.\n* Lastly, we've identified top directors and cast of this dataframe, both American. The Three Stooges is the most popular cast choice and Michael Curtiz is the top director based on the number of movies produced.\n\nFurther work on this dataset would include developping a Genre prediction algorithm or\/and a Recommendation system.","a4757aa0":"Out of the 24 origins represented in the dataframe, **the US** is an unconditional leader.\n\nInteresting to note, that there are quite a few ethnicities belonging to India. To make the further analysis easier, let's add a new column to this dataframe containing countries to which these ethnicities refer to.","f02008e6":"# Wikipedia Movie Plots EDA\n\nIn this kernel we are performing an exploratory data analysis based on the Wikipedia Movie Plots dataset https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/jrobischon\/wikipedia-movie-plots\n\nFirst step is to import all the necessary libraries.

Best known for its 161 theatrical short films by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the series centers on a rivalry between the title characters Tom, a cat, and Jerry, a mouse.

Let's see who is driving this growth.\n\n# World leaders","34549d06":"The difference between directors in this case seems less visible but if we take into consideration that filming even 1 movie might mean years of work, it changes the perception of the data.\n\nThe top director based on the number of movies produced is **Michael Curtiz**, a Hungarian-born American film director. The Wikipedia article about Michael Curtiz confirms that he is recognized as one of the most prolific directors in history. He was nominated five times for an Oscar and won twice, once for Best Short Subject for \"Sons of Liberty\" and once as Best Director for \"Casablanca\". \nhttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Michael_Curtiz\n\n**Hanna-Barbera** has the second place and it is not surprizing since these 2 directors (William Hanna and Joseph Barbera) have produced the \"Tom and Jerry\" cartoon which has the second place in the most frequent cast of this dataframe! ","14abdc53":"The most common words used in the plot column for American movies are:\n\n* find\n* leave\n* return\n* father\n* friend\n* house\n* kill\n* meet\n* help\n\nThis indicates such genres like \"mystery\", \"drama\", \"thriller\", maybe some \"romance\" and \"melodrama\" tend to be the most frequent ones.\n\n### India","706acab7":"# Movie genres\n\nIt would be interesting to compare what kinds of genres are the most popular in different countries.\n\nFirst, let's visualize the data of the \"Plot\" column using the word clouds for the 2 leaders - the US and India.\n\n### The US"}}
