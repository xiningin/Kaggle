The smallest absmax is choosen as the noise level. When looking at the waveform of the audio, this can intuitively be though of as the maximum amplitude of a small chunk where there is just noise.\n\nThen we go through the audio signal in longer and overlapping segments, if a segment has an absmax that is significantly larger than the noise level, we keep that segment."}}
