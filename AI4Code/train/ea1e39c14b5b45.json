It is scientifically represented as Hs or Hsig, is an important parameter for the statistical distribution of ocean waves. The most common waves are lower in height than Hs. This implies that encountering the significant wave is not too frequent. However, statistically, it is possible to encounter a wave that is much higher than the significant wave. \n\n\nTo predict the significant wave height, I  will analyze measured data collected by oceanographic wave measuring buoys anchored at Mooloolaba. Coverage period: 30 months collected at periods of 30 min intervals.\nThe data comes from Queensland Government Data - https:\/\/data.qld.gov.au\/dataset. I will use ARIMA method to predict the Hs values useing walk forward validation with a sliding window of 3000 time steps.","425309d5":"## Conclusion\nMy model is simple. I use data from last two months to predict (Hs) for the next step. I use walk forward\nvalidation with a sliding window of 3000 time steps (62.5 days). The model is tested for successive 200 time steps (10 hours). On average the difference between the predicted and actual data is about 31cm. The predictions and the actual data are also tested with a linear regression and found R value of 0.94. The results are very promising and could be enhanced further by optimizing the training window size.\n","6509dad0":"finding d","9289b506":"The series is stationary after one differencing, thus d=1","80fa8ed5":"We begin the analysis by importing the needed libraries and the data set.","2aa37c92":"Now you're ready to read in the data and use the plotting functions to visualize the data.","bf29f6bd":"We found a value of q=2.","c7e69d42":"A value of p=5 should be fine."}}
