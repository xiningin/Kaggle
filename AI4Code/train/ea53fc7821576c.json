Anyone who has watched the movie Titanic would remember that women and children were given preference to lifeboats (as they were in real life). You would also remember the vast class disparity of the passengers.\n\nThis indicates that Age, Sex, and PClass may be good predictors of survival. We'll start by exploring Sex and Pclass by visualizing the data."}}
