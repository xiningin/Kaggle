We want to encourage our model to find parts of the weight space that are both accurate and stable. Therefore, from time to time we increase the learning rate (this is the 'restarts' in 'SGDR'), which will force the model to jump to a different part of the weight space if the current area is \"spikey\".

For this case the loss should be small because our model is predicting a label $1$ with high probability.\n\n`loss = -log(0.9) = 0.10`\n\nNow suppose x has label 0 but our model is predicting 0.9. In this case our loss should be much larger.\n\nloss = -log(1-0.9) = 2.30\n\n- Exercise: look at the other cases and convince yourself that this make sense.\n- Exercise: how would you rewrite `binary_loss` using `if` instead of `*` and `+`?\n\nWhy not just maximize accuracy?

In this path we will also store temporary data and final results. `ImageClassifierData.from_names_and_array` takes in the names of the image files as well as an array of ground-truth labels and creates a dataset ready for training.","8b026fdc":"Another trick we've used here is adding the `cycle_mult` parameter. Take a look at the following chart, and see if you can figure out what the parameter is doing:"}}
