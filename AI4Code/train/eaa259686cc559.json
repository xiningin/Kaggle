We should always have in mind that the **model performance will degrade overtime** as car values decrease more more, some strategy should be used to account this (the simplest of them is to scrape new data periodically and to retrain a new model, some advanced strategy that let us retain old data is to create a deflation model or to add a column of the period the data was scraped on and let machine learning understand the pattern).","844cc979":"The big difference between them is that the model tends to get wrong cars with big prices as they are usually outliers.

This **can also be useful to generate some features if the car is near the 40 years date (could increase in price as after that you are tax-exempt)**\n\nThe high-cardinality of model is a not a big warning for us, rather than that we shouldn't use one-hot encoding for it in our predictive models","e8411b5d":"We can see that dropping duplicates didn't change much, so our analysis is still valid (but in case we want to increase model accuracy even more in the future we can always go back and explore more)","94a4a929":"The algorithm we will use is Random Forest as it usually performs very well for regression problems.\nDepending on the task sometimes we don't need a model beast, something that works and has good accuracy is just enough to test an idea, you can think of more complex architecture later (for example using multiple algorithms of different types and using some kind of weighted average to get an optimal price estimation)\n\nAn alternative could also be that to throw the data to an Auto-ML library or cloud service and use that model and then later thin of complex feature engineering and improvements.","3fe4ebc5":"We can clearly see we have less data for hyudai skoda and toyota but nonetheless it is still succifient to create predictive models in machine learning.\nOne possibility to explore is that to use the same number of entries for each of the manufacturers","b980fff0":"This is just a simple notebook that aims to to basic analysis and model creation for the dataset at hand.
