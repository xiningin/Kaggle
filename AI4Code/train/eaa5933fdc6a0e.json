Since the cost of photovoltaic panels has decreased over the years and with more countries pushing for sustainability, we are intending to look for a potential building to implement our solar panels within the site of **Robin**. Using the dataset from the BDG Project 2, we will analyse the energy usage patterns of all the **educational buildings** in Robin in order to identify a potential building which could be a site for our solar panels.\n\nAn analysis and evaluation of the energy consumption and usage patterns will be conducted using various visualization techniques. This will then be compared to the weather data in particular the temperature data of each days to ascertain the peak periods of energy consumption and to see whether temperature affects the total energy consumptions.\n\n\nWe will also be analysing another site called **Bobcat**, where we have implemented our solar panels previously. The total energy consumption will be looked into in order to assess the viability of implementing the same system in Robin to reduce the energy consumption during peak periods and reaped savings.\n\nSubsequently, with the data that we have gathered, we hope to recommend the implementation of our solar panels as a solution that can address the peak periods of energy consumption of educational buildings in Robin.","2217a1a7":"# 3.

Since we are only implementing solar panels on just one potential building, we will focus on Margarito. Although both have high energy consumption, Margarito's energy consumption is slightly higher especially during the summer periods which we wish to address. Implementing solar panels could aid in energy reduction and savings in addition to lowering the building's carbon footprint. In the third section, we will be taking a look at the energy consumption of buildings in Bobcat where we previously installed our solar panels. We will then be analysing if the solar panels in Bobcat reaps benefits and aids in the reduction of energy consumption.","9559c44c":"### Analysis \n<hr>\nOver the course of 2 years, the highest temperature ranging from 32 all the way to the highest at 34 Degree Celcius took place around July which falls under the Summer season. This explains why our chosen building Margarito has a higher energy usage level during this period as it was the summer season where extra cooling would be needed to bring down the temperature to the most comfortable level. ","dbd98112":"### Analysis \n<hr>\nFrom the above data, we will extract one particular building from each site and compare them accordingly. For Robin, we will zero in on Margarito, which is the potential site we have decided to focus on. For Bobcat, we choose Whitney as it is a building with the highest energy consumption on the site.","efff9745":"### Analysis of Daily Data\n<hr>\nLooking at the daily data of the educational buildings in Robin, all the data seems to have very varied behaviour from each other. For instance, So and Derrick seems to have a pretty consistent energy consumption trend for the rest of the year. Buildings such as Terrance and Jasper share a close similarity in energy usage patterns with both having 5 major dips (excluding the one at the end of 2016) and relatively high energy consumption especially in 2016. The occasional dips in between peaks for most of the educational buildings could be due to the weekends where classes are not being held and hence lesser energy is utilised to run the  building.

These buildings could have special purposes that does not require year-round electricity.","7ff65446":"### Plotting Line Charts\n<hr>\nThe extracted data from the Robin educational buildlings would then be plotted into line charts to have a clearer understanding of the energy consumption pattern of each respective building as well as the shape and frequency.

Today, the use of data is becoming more widespread and has significantly gain importance as more companies recognize the value of having data to aid in decision-making. With data, we can create visualizations and gain insights that will eneable us to make better informed decisions. A survey commissioned by Deloitte noted that 49% of respondents mentioned that analytics has enabled them to make better decisions. In the real estate sector, for example, property companies may have large datasets on various land and buildings which may help them to understand the value of these properties and how to market them better. On the other hand, in the construction sector, the use of big data from Building Information Modelling (BIM) can present generative design, performance prediction and a more optimized use of resources.\n\nReferences:\n1.

Although the general temperature for the site of Bobcat is higher than Robin, as we previously determined, a comparison of two buildings with the most energy usage shows us that Bobcat does indeed use less energy. It can be inferred from this that in the long-run, using solar energy could improve energy efficiency and achieve savings. Therefore, it is viable to install our solar panels in Margarito, Robin.\n\nWith this data analysis, we can then propose to Margarito on the implementation of our solar panels which will help to justify our business case. \n\n","4780fea6":"# Table of contents\n***\n\n* [1.
