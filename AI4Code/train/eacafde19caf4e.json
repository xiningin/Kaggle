It depends only on the user previous choices, making this method robust to avoid the *cold-start* problem.\nFor textual items, like articles, news and books, it is simple to use the raw text to build item profiles and user profiles.  \nHere we are using a very popular technique in information retrieval (search engines) named [TF-IDF](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tf%E2%80%93idf). This technique converts unstructured text into a vector structure, where each word is represented by a position in the vector, and the value measures how relevant a given word is for an article.

Here are some tips:\n- In this example, we've completely ignored the time, considering that all articles were available to be recommended to users at any time. A better approach would be to filter only articles that were available for users at a given time.\n- You could leverage the available contextual information to model users preferences across time (period of day, day of week, month), location (country and state\/district) and devices (browser, mobile native app).  \nThis contextual information can be easily incorporated in [Learn-to-Rank](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Learning_to_rank) models (like XGBoost Gradient Boosting Decision Trees with ranking objective) or Logistic models (with categorical features [One-Hot encoded](http:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/generated\/sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder.html) or [Feature Hashed](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Feature_hashing)).

All evaluation metrics reported here are computed using the **test set**.\n\nPs. A more robust evaluation approach could be to split train and test sets by a reference date, where the train set is composed by all interactions before that date, and the test set are interactions after that date.

The objective of a RecSys is to recommend relevant items for users, based on their preference. Preference and relevance are subjective, and they are generally inferred by items users have consumed previously.  \nThe main RecSys techniques are:  \n- [**Collaborative Filtering**](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Collaborative_filtering): This method makes automatic predictions (filtering) about the interests of a user by collecting preferences or taste information from many users (collaborating). The underlying assumption of the collaborative filtering approach is that if a person A has the same opinion as a person B on a set of items, A is more likely to have B's opinion for a given item than that of a randomly chosen person.   \n- [**Content-Based Filtering**](http:\/\/recommender-systems.org\/content-based-filtering\/): This method uses only information about the description and attributes of the items users has previously consumed to model user's preferences. In other words, these algorithms try to recommend items that are similar to those that a user liked in the past (or is examining in the present). In particular, various candidate items are compared with items previously rated by the user and the best-matching items are recommended.  \n- **Hybrid methods**:  Recent research has demonstrated that a hybrid approach, combining collaborative filtering and content-based filtering could be more effective than pure approaches in some cases. These methods can also be used to overcome some of the common problems in recommender systems such as cold start and the sparsity problem.","7dab4275":"Collaborative Filtering (CF) has two main implementation strategies:  \n- **Memory-based**: This approach uses the memory of previous users interactions to compute users similarities based on items they've interacted (user-based approach) or compute items similarities based on the users that have interacted with them (item-based approach).  \nA typical example of this approach is User Neighbourhood-based CF, in which the top-N similar users (usually computed using Pearson correlation) for a user are selected and used to recommend items those similar users liked, but the current user have not interacted yet. This approach is very simple to implement, but usually do not scale well for many users. A nice Python implementation of this approach in available in [Crab](http:\/\/muricoca.github.io\/crab\/).\n- **Model-based**: This approach, models are developed using different machine learning algorithms to recommend items to users. There are many model-based CF algorithms, like neural networks, bayesian networks, clustering models, and latent factor models such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and, probabilistic latent semantic analysis.","52825904":"Let's test the best model (Hybrid) for my user.","9c85bcd0":"# Content-Based Filtering model","95a60890":"Recommender systems have a problem known as ***user cold-start***, in which is hard do provide personalized recommendations for users with none or a very few number of consumed items, due to the lack of information to model their preferences.  \nFor this reason, we are keeping in the dataset only users with at leas 5 interactions.","b1ae4e85":"# Popularity model","a9980d97":"# Recommender Systems in Python 101","ce85e421":"An important decision is the number of factors to factor the user-item matrix.
