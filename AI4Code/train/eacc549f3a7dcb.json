What is nice about Folium is that it was developed for the sole purpose of visualizing geospatial data. While other libraries are available to visualize geospatial data, such as plotly, they might have a cap on how many API calls you can make within a defined time frame. Folium, on the other hand, is completely free.","a4586884":"Example of **Stamen Toner** Tiles.\nTo display the World Map of India along with:\nlocating Ahmedabad and Surat with CircleMarker","573d5174":"To display the World Map Centerd around **India**","548cbe83":"By default tiles is **OpenStreetMap**.

It enables both the binding of data to a map for choropleth visualizations as well as passing Vincent\/Vega   visualizations as markers on the map.\n\n* The library has a number of built-in tilesets from OpenStreetMap, Mapbox, and Stamen, and supports custom tilesets with Mapbox or Cloudmade API keys.
