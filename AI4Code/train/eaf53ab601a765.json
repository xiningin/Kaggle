As a vaccination scheme, they started using Pfizer\/BioNTech, the first vaccination scheme that was issued. In the next weeks, two more vaccination schemes were added, Moderna and Oxford\/AstraZeneca (limited to people unde 55 years old). From May, also Johnson&Johnson was added to the vaccinations options.\n\nVaccination is scheduled in Romania in 3 main steps, as following:\n- 1st wave, for all medical staff (doctors, nurses, ambulance workers ...);  for them Pfizer\/BioNTech vaccines were used; most of them already had the rapel administred (21 days after the first shot); \n- 2nd wave, people over 65 years old, with chronical medical conditions (that increase the likelihood of severe illness if infected with COVID-19) and from essential activities (key government positions, industries essential for fighting the pandemics ...); they also were administred primarly Pfizer\/BioNTech, but now they are also getting Moderna and Oxford\/AstraZeneca.\n- 3rd wave, for general population; this wave is as well divided in two contingents, III-A, with mostly staff from private business areas considered to have priority, due to exposure to public or dependence of other economic areas on them (extractive and manufacturing industries, hairdressing and personal care services, bank clerks and supermarket staff); for them it is reserved Oxford\/AstraZeneca; the group III-B represents the general population and them are not yet scheduled.\nUpdate: Currently, based on registering on waiting lists at various vaccination centers, everybody is programmed automatically, without being asked to opt for a certain vaccine, with either Pfizer, Moderna or Oxford\/AstraZeneca. Update: Johnson&Johnson is also an option.\n\nAfter mid-April, vaccination programme became more diverse, including:\n- Vaccination marathons over weekend, first one being held in Timisoara, one of the large cities in W of Romania;\n- Vaccination drive-through in several large cities, including the Capital city, Bucharest;\n- Vaccination without reservation (first arrived get a jab) in several large cities.\n\nThe most difficult problem for the authorities will be to reach to the small communities, in the countryside and small towns, where more than 40% of the Romanian population is still living.\n\nPopulation acceptance is also an important factor. Romanian President was the first person to be vaccinated in 2nd wave and the procedure was performed in from of television cameras.\n\nNote June 22: In recent weeks, the dynamic of vaccination slowed down.\n\n<center><img src=\"https:\/\/s.iw.ro\/gateway\/g\/ZmlsZVNvdXJjZT1odHRwJTNBJTJGJTJG\/c3RvcmFnZTA3dHJhbnNjb2Rlci5yY3Mt\/cmRzLnJvJTJGc3RvcmFnZSUyRjIwMjEl\/MkYwMSUyRjE1JTJGMTI3NjE2NV8xMjc2\/MTY1X211c2NoaWktbHVpLWlvaGFubmlz\/LmpwZyZ3PTEyMDAmaD02MzAmemM9MSZo\/YXNoPWQ3ZjMzNTc2ZWM1NWY2M2VhMjJlMzVjZjlmZTVhODlj.thumb.jpg\" width=600><\/img><\/center>\n\n\nWe show here the vaccination progress.
