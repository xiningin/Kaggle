and outpatients, also with overall","952622b8":"1 person works, but mostly group consists from unemployeed patients","8d2c97a4":"It does not mean that mostly people suffer from depression in this range, but our 55 patients are in this range","d881b7f3":"Now, let's check correlation between affect type and number of days observed","c6862d19":"How files condition and control files look like:","7c82a00f":"### Inpatient","fe6d100c":"### Days observed: Let's look in generall how many days patients were observed","ace84ab7":"I thought that, they may work, and it will put an extra effort to them which may cause depression in their state. But no, one of them not working","47d40586":"We have here, patient who worked at same time and still managed to show improvements! Huge respect, nothing else","64f94655":"We can see the patients who's condition get worsen with red area ","9175dd5e":"Now, I have set for which I should predict their disease types (Control group) and condition group.

Because, depression in not a joke, and serious disease which won't let people live as everything is ok.","65b4930a":"Big oof. As we noticed women mostly are not showing good improvements. I am not a doctor but obviously men and women express and feel differently due to links in brain which may react differently on same treatment","a7dafa36":"This set is not normally distributed. Mostly from depression suffer people in 40-54 age interval","213060be":"The purpose of this notebook is to observe how different types of diseases affect to patient's activity.","cad24968":"I tried gain insight out of this two patients characteristics, but they look absolute standard patients in whole dataset. May be I will understand this patients special cases when I will observe each patient separately","feb700ed":"Not so easy to understand this graph, now let's visualize it in another way","12290125":"We see that mostly they were observed in standard range, every patient","dc492ecf":"Let's create also simple pie charts for: marriage status and affect type","3757a415":"Scores will be our base point from which I will group patients (e.g. by affect type or inpatient status, e.t.c.)","8a9d8c85":"I think it will be better to create new column for afftype with their string type","e48d8841":"We can see from this numbers that in condition group there Males are dominating in numbers and in Control group female are dominant","b9f46f6c":"This one is reversed from previos count plot and left skewed. May be, older you are harder to treated?","5fecf360":"Age for inpatient","08aa72bc":"We can see here only one person from has melancholia from condition group and I think i should drop this attribute","1e711c77":"I assume that gender do not affect to inpatient column","052a089a":"Let's check distribution by sex with the help of boxplot","f285708c":"Let's look at whole range","2130872a":"Let's check employeed people who have depression ","818daf05":"Exploring scores dataset","c43def99":"Next, I would like to create age distribution count plot for groups","fac18dab":"Are they working?","ac1d211c":"We can there only one patient with bipolar first disorder, 7 with bipolar second and 15 with unipolar depressive. Meaning that most people from condition group are used to have low activity level by time.","d8aa447a":"What we can see here: obviously they were treated out of hospital; 2 males and 1 female. Both of men have Unipolar depressive disease and feamle has Bipolar second type","bb7d7b61":"1 with melancholia, 2 without","54cb992d":"I expected to see other result, but it may show this result cause most of our patients are in age range between 30 and 54","014e47f1":"What are their disease type?","022b0b84":"What we can see here is in general most of data lies between 10 and 15 days and Unipolar type has outliers. Instead of saving every observed days I can create new one observed_level which will take 1 if days are few, 2 if it is in standard range and 3 if days are too many","3fca2f1a":"I want to start with smallest, yet I think important group for this work, patients who's condition got worsen in time of treatment","fc1e305f":"Not so easy to understand","9a9bb52c":"Again, as most of patients overall, they were treated out of hospital.","81b6c6c9":"Yep, as many of our data this one is also Right skewed","d4251757":"Output: for control group, we don't have that much variance as we have in condition group. Number of days itself, I think will not describe a lot of insights. But in combination with other attributes it will help us to normalize our hypothesis","cb7c2b3e":"Also some interesting fact: All people who were treated in hospital are not working and mostly single. I think these two are decision making factors.","efdedf82":"Yep, for this group functions look bit strange, but when I will try them for more populated groups it will do what it should","e9e5af8c":"Well, I've grouped them and now, let's observe their characteristics","68689d97":"Condition and Control groups are not obeyed by same distribution.","b128d485":"Remark: list of patients who's condition did not change, will also include patients who's score changed only by few points.","64c06b75":"Output: Most of the patients were observed from 8 days up to 16. Most popular is 13 days.","f4e5327b":"Output: as there only 55 patients we can't deploy this hypothesises to all people. But, at the early age patients number is high, also from 20-25 mosly suffer men and then till 40 women","6c71eba8":"From observation group, we have 6 people who were treated in hospital and 18 outpatient","a67502c0":"Wow, this one looks bit different from general, most of patients who showed good progress were single","29901dfe":"### Age","aeb2df6e":"### Patients that got better after treatment","d09c53f5":"### Sex","3ac11307":"In general, mostly they were observed in standard range between 10 and 16 days, but we can see that some of them made huge progress just in one week","1d5230ab":"At the end based on how patient's condition flew I will try to find his type of disease, final MARDS score ","63bf8b1e":"Also, let's check  how different gender seperated by age ranges","782d59b3":"It looks more understandable now","3165aa70":"It may also be that group that showed good improvements are single and jobless which help to focus on treatment.","8140a9e8":"They were observed in standard range of days","6d07ea10":"I believed that treating in hospital, highly effects to progress, but there is still patients with stable MADRS scores","d3f990c1":"After observing mean values, i decided to built visuualize data in ranges to see how many of them are inpatient and outpatient","7f657746":"Days oberved with affect type","6518caf7":"Yeah work here is done. Next step would be analyzing each patient's condition by each minimute on their own files.","265c44e3":"### Education","ad14ab3a":"What we already can notice is all of them have Unipolar depressive type meaning that it may flow harder than bipolar diseases, but we should also not forget that most of people in this set suffering from Unipolar","3b9b70f1":"### Finally, patients whose final result is not so far from starting point","49dd5874":"They both have Unipolar depressive type, which is most popular type in this dataset.","2ffac003":"Yep, both of them are not single","13675304":"Little bit about this test. Next to the HAM-D17, the MADRS is the most commonly used outcome measure in antidepressant efficacy trials and has been used with increasing frequency during the past decade. The main purpose of this scale is to assess depressive symptomology, particularly change in patients treated with antidepressants. While the HAM-D17 includes items that address somatic symptoms, the MADRS focuses on the psychological symptoms of depression (e.g., sadness, tension, and pessimistic thoughts). This scale is clinician-rated and consists of 10 items; each item is rated on a 0-6 scale, resulting in a maximum total score of 60 points, with higher scores indicative of greater depressive symptomology. The MADRS scoring instructions indicate that a total score ranging from 0 to 6 indicates that the patient is in the normal range (no depression), a score ranging from 7 to 19 indicates \u201cmild depression,\u201d 20 to 34 indicates \u201cmoderate depression,\u201d a score of 35 and greater indicates \u201csevere depression,\u201d and a total score of 60 or greater indicates \u201cvery severe depression.\u201d There is evidence that an improvement of two points or more on the MADRS is considered clinically relevant.","3929c9d3":"Hello, this is notebook for Depression observation.
