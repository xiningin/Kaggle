We ask four main questions: Is Big Data very new or very old? How well can we now predict individual and aggregate well-being with Big Data, and to what extent do\nnovel measurement tools complement surveybased measures? Is Big Data responsible for the rising interest in well-being or a threat to it?<br>\nWhat are the economic and societal consequences of Big Data, and is there a point to government regulation of ownership, access, and consent?<br>\n\nAcademic articles and books on these developments are now plentiful. The term used to describe this data explosion and its\nBig Brother type uses, \u201cBig Data\u201d, was cited 40,000 times in 2017 in Google Scholar, about as often as \u201chappiness\u201d! This data explosion was accompanied by the rise of statistical techniques coming from the field of computer science, in particular machine learning. The later provided methods to analyse and exploit these large datasets for prediction purposes, justifying the accumulation of increasingly large and detailed data.The term Big Data in this chapter will refer to large datasets that contain multiple observations\nof individuals.4 Of particular interest is the data gathered on individuals without their \u201cconsidered consent\u201d. This will include all forms of data that one could gather, if determined, about others without their knowledge, such as visual information\nand basic demographic and behavioural characteristics. Other examples are Twitter, public Facebook posts, the luminescence of\nhomes, property, etc.Is this information used to say something about well-being, ie Life Satisfaction? How could it be used to affect well-being? And how should it be used? These question concerning Big Data and Well-being - where are we, where could we go, and where should we go - will be explored in this chapter.<br>","011dbd1f":"**About The Columns**\n\n**Country** Name of the country.<br>\n**Region** Region the country belongs to.<br>\n**Happiness Rank** Rank of the country based on the Happiness Score.<br>\n**Happiness Score** A metric measured in 2015 by asking the sampled people the question: \"How would you rate your happiness on a scale of 0 to 10 where 10 is the happiest.\"<br>\n**Standard Error** The standard error of the happiness score.<br>\n**Economy** (GDP per Capita)The extent to which GDP contributes to the calculation of the Happiness Score.<br>\n**Family** The extent to which Family contributes to the calculation of the Happiness Score<br>\n**Health (Life Expectancy)** The extent to which Life expectancy contributed to the calculation of the Happiness Score<br>\n**Freedom** The extent to which Freedom contributed to the calculation of the Happiness Score.<br>\n**Trust** (Government Corruption)The extent to which Perception of Corruption contributes to Happiness Score.<br>\n**Generosity** The extent to which Generosity contributed to the calculation of the Happiness Score.<br>\n**Dystopia Residual** The extent to which Dystopia Residual contributed to the calculation of the Happiness Score.<br>","5f448a0d":"In short, adolescents who spend more time on electronic devices are less happy, and adolescents who spend more time on most other activities are happier. This creates the possibility that iGen adolescents are less happy because their increased\ntime on digital media has displaced time that previous generations spent on non-screen activities linked to happiness. In other words,\ndigital media may have an indirect effect on happiness as it displaces time that could be otherwise spent on more beneficial activities.<br>\n\n","43d8d6de":"**About The Dataset**\n\nThe happiness scores and rankings use data from the Gallup World Poll. The scores are based on answers to the main life evaluation question asked in the poll. This question, known as the Cantril ladder, asks respondents to think of a ladder with the best possible life for them being a 10 and the worst possible life being a 0 and to rate their own current lives on that scale. The scores are from nationally representative samples for the years 2013-2016 and use the Gallup weights to make the estimates representative. The columns following the happiness score estimate the extent to which each of six factors \u2013 economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity \u2013 contribute to making life evaluations higher in each country than they are in Dystopia, a hypothetical country that has values equal to the world\u2019s lowest national averages for each of the six factors. They have no impact on the total score reported for each country, but they do explain why some countries rank higher than others.<br>\n\n","7192a243":"**What do the columns succeeding the Happiness Score(like Family, Generosity, etc.) describe?**\n\nThe following columns: GDP per Capita, Family, Life Expectancy, Freedom, Generosity, Trust Government Corruption describe the extent to which these factors contribute in evaluating the happiness in each country. The Dystopia Residual metric actually is the Dystopia Happiness Score(1.85) + the Residual value or the unexplained value for each country as stated in the previous answer.\n\nIf you add all these factors up, you get the happiness score so it might be un-reliable to model them to predict Happiness Scores."}}
