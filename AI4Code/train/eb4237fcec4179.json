Furthermore, variables such as ARF, Dep, Road Tax are calculated fields from OMV, COE month left, engine capacity. They are similar across similar models and make. All except mileage is the only difference which no two cars shares the same. \n\nMileage and price have a moderate co-relationship, suggesting price may be affected by milege of a car. However in singapore, each car has a lifespan of 10 years due to certificate or entitlement. Unlike other countries which has no limit on the years you can use a car, mileage pose a important factor for used car as it determines how frequently the car has been used. Higher mileage would suggest more usage and repair cost for one might likely to be higher.

But usually cars of older age lesser than 3 years will have a higher depreciation due to its affordability. As lower cash outlay is usually required, thus the high depreciation on average.\n\nHere we conclude that in a case of singapore used car market, mileage affects pricing in car in different car age segment. It may be applicable to newer cars or some specific higher end models. For bread and butter cars, the difference is rather insignificant.\n\nOr that the mileage in the list may not be true due human error.

Growth rate are determined by a ratio of car population vs road built. The growth rate is controlled by a quota system where only certain amount of cars can be registered in a month. The system is called the Certificate of Entitlement, also known as COE in short, a paper licence to legally own a car in Singapore. It is only valid for ten years after which one may choose to renew this licence for a 5 years or 10 years to keep ownership. Otherwise, the vehicle will need to be scrapped or exported to make way for a new car to be registered by other owners.\n\nBesides the COE, there are also other taxes to discourage car ownership. To put in context, a popular sedan such as a new Toyota Corolla may cost 28,000 (in singapore dollars) to 40,000 elsewhere in the world, but will cost 80,000 to 120,000 depending on quota available on the certificates, which its price mark is a variable that fluctuates along supply and demand. \n\nMore information can be found at https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Driving_in_Singapore\n\nFor this data analysis, we would like to find out more about Singapore used car market. While new car price fluctuates with the quota of COEs, used car price too are affected when new car price changes.
