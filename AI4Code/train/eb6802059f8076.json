To be honest I can't run this fully on Kaggle due to memory constraints. But don't worry, i'll upload the resulting output on the next part of this series. Rather, you can try running this code on your local machine (of course, you have to download all needed input files for this kernel)\n\nWithout further adeu, let's get into the code","bf9a142b":"And that's it.

I commented out the code that converts the images directly. THe problem is Kaggle can't handle the output that's created. You can however still run this notebook into your machine.
