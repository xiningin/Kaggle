Extra, extra! Extract the news headlines\n<p>As we saw above, the interesting data inside each table row (<code>&lt;tr&gt;<\/code>) is in the text inside the <code>&lt;td&gt;<\/code> and <code>&lt;a&gt;<\/code> tags. Let's now actually parse the data for <strong>all<\/strong> tables in a comfortable data structure.<\/p>","b3efbd90":"## 4. Make NLTK think like a financial journalist\n<p>Sentiment analysis is very sensitive to context. As an example, saying <em>\"This is so addictive!\"<\/em> often means something positive if the context is a video game you are enjoying with your friends, but it very often means something negative when we are talking about opioids. Remember that the reason we chose headlines is so we can try to extract sentiment from financial journalists, who like most professionals, have their own lingo. Let's now make NLTK think like a financial journalist by adding some new words and sentiment values to our lexicon.<\/p>","c0750d1a":"## 7. Weekends and duplicates\n<p>What happened to Tesla on November 22nd? Since we happen to have the headlines inside our <code>DataFrame<\/code>, a quick peek reveals that there are a few problems with that particular day: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>There are only 5 headlines for that day.<\/li>\n<li>Two headlines are verbatim the same as another but from another news outlet.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Let's clean up the dataset a bit, but not too much! While some headlines are the same news piece from different sources, the fact that they are written differently could provide different perspectives on the same story. Plus, when one piece of news is more important, it tends to get more headlines from multiple sources. What we want to get rid of is verbatim copied headlines, as these are very likely coming from the same journalist and are just being \"forwarded\" around, so to speak.<\/p>","9a675ed0":"## 9.

Searching for gold inside HTML files\n<p>It used to take days for financial news to spread via radio, newspapers, and word of mouth. Now, in the age of the internet, it takes seconds.

Hedge funds and independent traders are using data science to process this wealth of information in the quest for profit.<\/p>\n<p>In this notebook, we will generate investing insight by applying <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sentiment_analysis\">sentiment analysis<\/a> on financial news headlines from <a href=\"https:\/\/finviz.com\">FINVIZ.com<\/a>.
