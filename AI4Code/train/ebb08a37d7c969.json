Different types of vaccines work in different ways to offer protection, but with all types of vaccines, the body is left with a supply of \u201cmemory\u201d T-lymphocytes as well as B-lymphocytes that will remember how to fight that virus in the future.\n\nIt typically takes a few weeks for the body to produce T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes after vaccination. Therefore, it is possible that a person could be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 just before or just after vaccination and then get sick because the vaccine did not have enough time to provide protection.\n\nSometimes after vaccination, the process of building immunity can cause symptoms, such as fever. These symptoms are normal and are a sign that the body is building immunity.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/vaccines\/different-vaccines\/how-they-work.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fvaccines%2Fabout-vaccines%2Fhow-they-work.html","a594707d":"There is no sentiment analysis.

The UK has 40m doses of this vaccine on order.\n\nThe Pfizer\/BioNTech Covid jab is an mRNA vaccine \u2013 a cutting-edge technology. The vaccine works by introducing into the body genetic material, called mRNA, that contains the instructions to make the so-called \u201cspike\u201d protein of the coronavirus.\n\nIn response to these proteins, the body\u2019s immune pathways are activated \u2013 a response that offers protection should we encounter the virus itself.\n\n<font color=\"#2ECC71\">How is it going to be stored and transported?<\/font>\n\nThe Pfizer\/BioNTech vaccine, while exciting, brings logistical challenges. Among them, the vaccine must be stored and transported at about -70C.\n\nTo keep the vaccine at the required ultra-low temperature, the doses will be packaged with solid carbon dioxide and placed in reusable containers that resemble pizza boxes for shipping. Pfizer said that, unopened, these boxes keep the vaccine at the correct temperature for 10 days.\n\n<font color=\"#2ECC71\">Dry ice allows vaccine to be stored for up to 30 days. Vaccine monitored.<\/font>\n\nOnce in the UK, the vaccine will be transported to vaccination centres \u2013 there they can be stored in regular medical refrigerators at 2C-8C for up to five days, or the shipping boxes can be topped up with dry ice every five days allowing the vaccine to be stored for up to 30 days.\n\nThe temperature of the vaccine will be carefully monitored at each stage of transport to ensure the doses do not become unstable and ineffective. However Pfizer has said the vaccine will be shipped on a \u201cjust in time\u201d basis, meaning frozen doses are rapidly delivered to vaccination centres as needed.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2020\/dec\/02\/how-does-the-pfizerbiontech-covid-vaccine-work-and-who-will-get-it","5230f595":"<font color=\"#EC7063\">Most COVID-19 Vaccines Require More Than One Shot<\/font>\n\nAll but one of the COVID-19 vaccines that are currently in Phase 3 clinical trials in the United States use two shots. The first shot starts building protection. A second shot a few weeks later is needed to get the most protection the vaccine has to offer. One vaccine in Phase 3 clinical trials only needs one shot.\n\nGetting vaccinated is one of many steps you can take to protect yourself and others from COVID-19.  Protection from COVID-19 is critically important because for some people, it can cause severe illness or death.\n\nStopping a pandemic requires using all the tools available. Vaccines work with your immune system so your body will be ready to fight the virus if you are exposed. Other steps, like masks and social distancing, help reduce your chance of being exposed to the virus or spreading it to others. Together, COVID-19 vaccination and following recommendations to protect yourself and others will offer the best protection from COVID-19.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/vaccines\/different-vaccines\/how-they-work.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fvaccines%2Fabout-vaccines%2Fhow-they-work.html","baf0107b":"Applying processPost function for preprocessing","ff9a51d6":"Preprocess data","d62ea89a":"<font color=\"#EC7063\">Types of Vaccines<\/font>\n\n\nCurrently, there are three main types of COVID-19 vaccines that are or soon will be undergoing large-scale (Phase 3) clinical trials in the United States. Below is a description of how each type of vaccine prompts our bodies to recognize and protect us from the virus that causes COVID-19. None of these vaccines can give you COVID-19.\n\n<font color=\"#2ECC71\">mRNA vaccines<\/font>\n\nmRNA vaccines contain material from the virus that causes COVID-19 that gives our cells instructions for how to make a harmless protein that is unique to the virus. After our cells make copies of the protein, they destroy the genetic material from the vaccine. Our bodies recognize that the protein should not be there and build T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes that will remember how to fight the virus that causes COVID-19 if we are infected in the future.\n\n<font color=\"#2ECC71\">Protein subunit vaccines<\/font>\n\nProtein subunit vaccines include harmless pieces (proteins) of the virus that cause COVID-19 instead of the entire germ. Once vaccinated, our immune system recognizes that the proteins don\u2019t belong in the body and begins making T-lymphocytes and antibodies. If we are ever infected in the future, memory cells will recognize and fight the virus.\n\n<font color=\"#2ECC71\">Vector vaccines<\/font>\n\nVector vaccines contain a weakened version of a live virus\u2014a different virus than the one that causes COVID-19\u2014that has genetic material from the virus that causes COVID-19 inserted in it (this is called a viral vector). Once the viral vector is inside our cells, the genetic material gives cells instructions to make a protein that is unique to the virus that causes COVID-19. Using these instructions, our cells make copies of the protein. This prompts our bodies to build T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes that will remember how to fight that virus if we are infected in the future.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/vaccines\/different-vaccines\/how-they-work.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fvaccines%2Fabout-vaccines%2Fhow-they-work.html","eb8302c2":"<font color=\"#EC7063\">Taking a trial shot of Russia's Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine<\/font>\n\n![](https:\/\/static.dw.com\/image\/55809011_401.jpg)https:\/\/www.dw.com\/en\/taking-a-trial-shot-of-russias-sputnik-v-covid-19-vaccine\/a-55817820\n\nIts name alone speaks of Russia's ambition: Sputnik V, the country's leading vaccine against Covid-19, is meant to be a world-beater just like its cosmic namesake.\n\nBack in August, it was the first to be registered for emergency use although it had only been tested on a few dozen people.\n\nNow doctors, teachers and social workers are being offered Sputnik V in a mass inoculation campaign ordered by President Vladimir Putin. Its timing, just ahead of a similar launch in the UK, is unlikely to be a coincidence.\n\nBut Sputnik V is still in the midst of trials to check that it's safe and actually works, making some Russians wary of receiving it yet.\n\nAnd despite a fanfare over the vaccine's grand rollout, there are still problems scaling up production.\n\nIn a sense, this is no \"launch\" at all. Russian health workers have been getting vaccinated in tandem with the official trials for several months.

That means the candidate vaccines are tested in animal experiments, for example, rather than with human patients.\n\nWhen those tests are deemed successful, candidate vaccines can move into clinical trial phases. That's when they are tested with humans. There are three clinical trial phases for efficacy and safety before a vaccine can be approved for use by humans. The phases differ from each other, most significantly in their scale:\n\nIn Phase I, a vaccine is tested on small patient groups.\n\nIn Phase II, a vaccine is tested on larger groups of at least 100 patients; researchers can also test their candidate vaccine in specific subgroups, such as people with preexisting conditions, or patients with particular demographic characteristics, such as a higher age group.\n\nIn Phase III, a vaccine candidate is tested on at least 1,000 patients.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.dw.com\/en\/covid-19-vaccine-tracker-whats-the-progress\/a-55648707","7eadb368":"<font color=\"#EC7063\">What about the other Covid vaccines?<\/font>\n\n\nBoth the Moderna mRNA vaccine, and the Oxford University\/AstraZeneca vaccine (which uses a harmless chimp cold virus to deliver genetic information from the coronavirus to human cells) have released phase 3 clinical trial results and are under review by the MHRA.\n\n<font color=\"#2ECC71\">Moderna and Oxford University\/AstraZeneca Vaccines<\/font>\n\nThese jabs are also part of the UK government\u2019s portfolio of potential Covid vaccine candidates, with 7m doses of the Moderna vaccine and 100m doses of the Oxford University\/AstraZeneca vaccine already secured.\n\nThese vaccines have a key advantage over the Pfizer\/BioNTech jab \u2013 they do not need to be kept at -70C. Indeed the Moderna vaccine can be stored at -20C and is stable for up to 30 days at temperatures between 2C and 8C, while the Oxford University\/AstraZeneca vaccine can be stored between 2C and 8C for at least six months.
