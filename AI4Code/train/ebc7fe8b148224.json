Conclusion\n<p>The demand for blood fluctuates throughout the year. As one <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kjrh.com\/news\/local-news\/red-cross-in-blood-donation-crisis\">prominent<\/a> example, blood donations slow down during busy holiday seasons. An accurate forecast for the future supply of blood allows for an appropriate action to be taken ahead of time and therefore saving more lives.<\/p>\n<p>In this notebook, we explored automatic model selection using TPOT and AUC score we got was 0.7850. This is better than simply choosing <code>0<\/code> all the time (the target incidence suggests that such a model would have 76% success rate). We then log normalized our training data and improved the AUC score by 0.5%. In the field of machine learning, even small improvements in accuracy can be important, depending on the purpose.<\/p>\n<p>Another benefit of using logistic regression model is that it is interpretable. We can analyze how much of the variance in the response variable (<code>target<\/code>) can be explained by other variables in our dataset.<\/p>","02f66aab":"## 1.

Ensuring that there's enough blood in supply whenever needed is a serious challenge for the health professionals.
