I then used a compound interest formula on this future value and took the sum of the earnings a grad from a top-ranked school would have after t years, and set these equations equal to each other, solving for t.

In this scenario, the grad from a top-ranked school would not be investing any money during their time at university, whereas the state-school grad would be.\n\nThe amount of money the state-school grad invests per year of university is the difference between the average state-school tuition of [$9,687](https:\/\/www.topuniversities.com\/student-info\/student-finance\/how-much-does-it-cost-study-us) and each repspective private school's tuition.","4f109781":"To begin, I loaded the relevant datasets needed to complete this analysis, as well as the necessary python libraries.","b16d3f8d":"Now, to see what each dataset looks like.","83e2fdaa":"For degrees_df, I wanted to make sure that all the columns with numbers in the rows were actually floats and not strings, so I converted each number into floats.","f0c831e3":"After getting the top-ten schools with the highest-paid grads, and after confirming that all the data was changed to float values and that the indexing was properly reset, I wanted to add a column for each school's tuition.
