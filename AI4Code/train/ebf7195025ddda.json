Reading is an essential skill for academic success. When students have access to engaging passages offering the right level of challenge, they naturally develop reading skills.\n\nCurrently, most educational texts are matched to readers using traditional readability methods or commercially available formulas. However, each has its issues. Tools like Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level are based on weak proxies of text decoding (i.e., characters or syllables per word) and syntactic complexity (i.e., number or words per sentence). As a result, they lack construct and theoretical validity. At the same time, commercially available formulas, such as Lexile, can be cost-prohibitive, lack suitable validation studies, and suffer from transparency issues when the formula's features aren't publicly available.\n\nCommonLit, Inc., is a nonprofit education technology organization serving over 20 million teachers and students with free digital reading and writing lessons for grades 3-12. Together with Georgia State University, an R1 public research university in Atlanta, they are challenging Kagglers to improve readability rating methods.\n\nIn this competition, you\u2019ll build algorithms to rate the complexity of reading passages for grade 3-12 classroom use. To accomplish this, you'll pair your machine learning skills with a dataset that includes readers from a wide variety of age groups and a large collection of texts taken from various domains. Winning models will be sure to incorporate text cohesion and semantics.\n\nIf successful, you'll aid administrators, teachers, and students. Literacy curriculum developers and teachers who choose passages will be able to quickly and accurately evaluate works for their classrooms. Plus, these formulas will become more accessible for all. Perhaps most importantly, students will benefit from feedback on the complexity and readability of their work, making it far easier to improve essential reading skills. \n\n# Evaluation\n\nSubmissions are scored on the root mean squared error. RMSE is defined as:\n# $ RMSE = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \\widehat{y_i})^2} $\nwhere is the predicted value,   is the original value, and   is the number of rows in the test data.","33a80fc8":"# Hi, kagglers!","a46dfa63":"It is my work for CLRP Competition!

Obviously, the set $X$ is countable, cause we able to use all operations to create new features by olds. So we have $n$ estimators of our excerpts. (We assume that all assessors used their own model and participated in each assessment)\nFinally, $D = \\{ d_1, d_2, ..., d_k \\}$, where $d_i$ is amount of using $x_i$, $ i\\in N$, $i\\in [1, k]$, and $f: X\\leftrightarrow D$ \n\n*Example:* Let $n=2$, and $ M_1(x_1, x_2, x_4)$ & $ M_2(x_1, x_4, x_5)$ - models of estimators 1 & 2, $x_1(t_i), x_2(t_i), x_3(t_i), x_4(t_i), x_5(t_i)$ - features applied to the text $t_i$. We also guess, that $x$ features transformed to some kind that: $M_1 = x_1 + x_2 + x_4$, $M_2 = x_1 + x_4 + x_5$. If we think that final model is: $M = \\frac{M_1 + M_2}{2}$, we have $d_1 = 2$, $d_2 = 1$, $d_3 = 0$, $d_4 = 2$, $d_5 = 1$ \n\nWe get: $y_j = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{k}d_ix_i(t_j)$, where: $d_i\\in Z$, $d_i\\in [0, n]$\nOr: $y_j = \\sum_{i=1}^{k}p_ix_i(t_j)$, where: $p_i\\in [0, 1]$, $p_i$ is frequency or probability of using $x_i$, $p_i=1$ - everyone used, and, accordingly, $p_i=0$ - no one.\n\nThis would be a good model using probabilities as weights, but the idea is too simple to be true.
