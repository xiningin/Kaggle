We remove this column as it provides no use to us. We also change some Pandas options. This is intended so that whenever we call 'head', we can see all the features and column names without truncation.\n\nWe then replace the diagnoses with 1 for malignant (original represented as an 'M') and 0 for benign (originally represented as a 'B').
