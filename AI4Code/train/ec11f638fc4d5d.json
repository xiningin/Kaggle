This only shows up if you have written an output file (like we did in the Prepare Submission File step).","6f5fa374":"**Last Steps**\nClick on the Output button. This will bring you to a screen with an option to Submit to Competition. Hit that and you will see how your model performed.\n\nIf you want to go back to improve your model, click the Edit button, which re-opens the kernel. You'll need to re-run all the cells when you re-open the kernel.","773387e7":"In addition to your training data, there will be test data. This is frequently stored in a file with the title test.csv.

Here is sample code to do that.","dd265252":"**Example**\nWe're doing very minimal data set up here so we can focus on how to submit modeling results to competitions. Other tutorials will teach you how build great models. So the model in this example will be fairly simple.

Congrats.\n(Don't forget to submit it from the Output tab)\n\nIf you are ready to keep improving your model (and your skills), \nKeep improving on:\n    your feature selections\n    data cleaning\n    and tuning hyperparameter (c and epsilon)\n    etc..\n    \nIt is very possible that you can get a better score than me :)\n\n\/\/Adisak\n\n","86603f56":"**Prepare Submission File**\nWe make submissions in CSV files. Your submissions usually have two columns: an ID column and a prediction column. The ID field comes from the test data (keeping whatever name the ID field had in that data, which for the housing data is the string 'Id'). The prediction column will use the name of the target field.\n\nWe will create a DataFrame with this data, and then use the dataframe's to_csv method to write our submission file. Explicitly include the argument index=False to prevent pandas from adding another column in our csv file."}}
