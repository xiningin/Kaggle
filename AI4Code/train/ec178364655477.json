solutions in this notebook are primarily based on ratios, correlations, and trends over time. The data sources are all trustworthy and have citations. For ventilator need I am assuming that areas of high morbidity are going to have the greatest need, and that likewise, if there are common features in these high risk areas we can find new areas of higher potential risk.\n\n2. **Scientific model\/strategy:**\n<br \/>Ratios, correlations, and trends over time.\n\n3. **Unique and novel insight:**\n<br \/>There are some interesting correlations noted in the county level data section which may not be previously discovered. There is an interesting find in the subsection on cancer which I will need to do further research on before I could speak on its potential impact.\n\n4. **Market Translation and Applicability:**\n<br \/>There are some insights based on current ventilator needs of certain regions. The method for determining such methods should be easily applicable to other locations. Some of the discovered correlations might also be useful for determining public policy.\n\n5. **Speed to market:**\n<br \/>The approach of this notebook should be easy to compare to current methods for ventilator allocation. This being a supply chain issue you can compare this method to current methods and evaluate which has the greatest idle inventory and supply shortage.\n\n6. **Longevity of solution in market:**\n<br \/>The method for determining ventilator need shouldn't change over time, it primarily applies to change over time and ratios.\n\n7. **Ability of user to collaborate and contribute to other solutions within the Kaggle community:**\n<br \/> This notebook has been forked 9 times as of 6\/2, more than any other notebook in its catagory. This notebook also outputs two datasets, which are the two merged datasets used for correlations and plots.","761ed717":"###  NIH's National Cancer Institutes State Cancer Profiles\n\nDataset added by Zac Dannelly https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/dannellyz contains county level information on cancer rates of occurance.","7ba48e81":"<a id=\"conclusion\"><\/a>\n# Conclusion:\nAbove is the list of counties currently in need of ventilators and PPE. The steps used to generate this list can be useful for determining current need so long as one can get at least one weeks worth of valid data for a locale (which isn't exactly effortless). I suspect there may be some useful insights to be gained from the data on cancer occurrences in populations, I will continue to look into this and hopefully add more to the notebook in the coming week.\n\n# Final thoughts\n\nThere are more answers in the data that I didn't manage to find. There were opportunities to view the data from a county level but I chose to keep it higher level so that I could make a final dataframe that was intelligible when viewed all at once. If one were to view the information at a county level then they might also find the county health rankings dataset useful, one could have aggregated the county level information to get state level answers as well.\n\n\nThis year I've challenged myself to complete one task on Kaggle per week, in order to develop a larger Data Science portfolio.

Not having access to testing centers can result in underreporting. Puerto Rico isn't a state and The District of Columbia is part of the state of Maryland, so they might have testing centers not including the ones listed here.\n\nIn spite of having few testing centers Delaware and Rhode Island have a moderate infection rate. If there is an issue with capturing and reporting cases in these locations, it would indicate that they probably have a higher invisible population of infected.","0db39579":"The following table shows the states where hospital beds as a total is fewer than the total population which is infected. The minority of cases require hospitalization so this is not immediately a crisis as less than half of all covid cases require hospitalization.","2d2d79c6":"### Johns Hopkins University Center Datasets\n\nThese datasets contain the rate of infection, number of infected, and mortality rate. As one positive note, there is a substantial lag for incrementing the recovered total, so there is likely a bit of inflation the total infected cases (due to recoveries not being removed at the time of occurance). \n\nFor this part of the dataset, we are extracting the total deaths and confirmed cases by state for the master data frame which is named: ```risk``` . We are also extracting some time series data for the US to visualize how cases are progressing.","1f31b2b3":"<a id=\"part-three\"><\/a>\n# Part Three: County Level Observations\n\nBelow we have the Pearson correlation coefficients for morbidity, infection rate, confirmed cases and deaths. A score close to one would mean that two variables are closely and positively related (as one increases so does the other), a score close to negative one indicates a strong negative relationship (as one value increases the other decreases), and a score close to zero indicates that there is not a strong relationship. The dataset below is blended from several other datasets, infection rate is a ratio of the current total divided by the the total from one week prior (so that exponential growth would be more visible). Morbidity rate is the number of deaths currently, divided by the number of infected from one week prior.  The visible table below contains correlations from a long list of factors I wished to explore, I chose not to include race specific columns from the dataset as it can sometimes be challenging to separate correlations from race from correlations due to socioeconomic status. There are a pair of hidden tables below with the unabridged data.\n\nAlso worth noting: the data used to make these correlations was all gathered pre-Covid, so there isn't any guarantee that changing one particular variable now will impact the disease in this area.\n\n### Notable correlations:\n\nThere have been some interesting shifts since the first time these correlation tables were generated. The variation of the results is most likely the result of having more observed cases. There are now a lot of correlations one could mention I've plotted a few notable ones below these tables.\n\nResults from table 4\/5\/20:\n> \n>There are significant positive correlations between traffic density, and median household income with the morbidity rate for a county. Motor vehicle mortality rate and percent rural had a significant negative impact. Rate of change for infections didn't seem to have a >strong linear relationship with anything I selected. HIV prevalence had a positive relationship with the total amount of confirmed cases and fatalities. Driving to work alone had a significant negative correlation with the total amount of confirmed cases and fatalities.\n> \n>I had hoped to catch something a bit more actionable. So far the county level info just indicates that counties which are more rural, have longer commutes, low median household incomes are less at risk right now, but see as fast of a spread.\n","f9e5159e":"### Datasets\nBelow I have created two new csv files which have the datasets used for the county and state level observations.

To avoid being bombarded with too many numbers at once, I would advise only looking at what you're curious about in the table below and I'll show you some more specific details further in.
