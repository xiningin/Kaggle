And typically, hosts, such as desktops, shouldn't expect connections to a lot of its ports, especially those ports that are not used.\n\nAnd for ports that are scanned, a lot of them may not be open, so we shouldn't expect legitimate traffic to try to connect to unused ports unless there is some misconfiguration misconfiguration. So for unused ports, we would only expect traffic from the scanner and no one else.

If we assume that the callback occurs every _N seconds\/minutes\/hours_ with the same message (which is either something like \"I'm alive!\" or \"What are my commands?\"). Then we can look at 2 aspects\n- The time difference between callbacks would be consistent\n- The size (bytes) and duration of the connection would be consistent\n\nIt may also be that the callbacks that the botnet uses is some uncommon port, we can revisit the outbound ports used and _look at the long tail_.\n\nSince this is a botnet that is contacting the C&C server, the time difference may not be as reliable, however, the size of the connections might be consistent. \n\nIf we look for the the destinations that recieve consistent, connections sizes then we see that the hosts we identified earlier have 0 variance connection sizes. We see that callbacks are consistently `1337 bytes` large.

What port does it use?*","871870f8":"This problem is pretty straightforward as well, since the question directly asks for _the largest clique_. There are methods to get the largest clique however due to the size of the graphs that we would end up constructing, these approaches may not be reasonable.  \n\nTo get the exact answer, then we can [enumerate all cliques](https:\/\/networkx.github.io\/documentation\/networkx-1.10\/reference\/generated\/networkx.algorithms.clique.find_cliques.html) and find the largest one. However this does not scale well. \n\nInstead, we can use an approximate method [max_clique(G)](https:\/\/networkx.github.io\/documentation\/networkx-1.9\/reference\/generated\/networkx.algorithms.approximation.clique.max_clique.html). However, we opt to use the even faster [large_clique_size(G)](https:\/\/networkx.github.io\/documentation\/latest\/reference\/algorithms\/generated\/networkx.algorithms.approximation.clique.large_clique_size.html), which gives reasonable sizes in practice.
