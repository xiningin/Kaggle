Right off the bat, there are a few columns that contain null values ('director', 'cast', 'country', 'date_added', 'rating').","e2bdc51c":"In terms of genres, international movies takes the cake surprisingly followed by dramas and comedies. Even though the United States has the most content available, it looks like Netflix has decided to release a ton of international movies. The reason for this could be that most Netflix subscribers aren't actually in the United States, but rather the majority of viewers are actually international subscribers.","4a29ccb9":"Based on the above timeline, we can see that the popular streaming platform started gaining traction after 2014. Since then, the amount of content added has been tremendous. I decided to exclude content added during 2020 since the data does not include a full years worth of data. We can see that there has been a consistent growth in the number of movies on Netflix compared to shows.","889b4bc4":"# Analysis on Netflix Movies & TV Shows\nNetflix is a popular service that people across the world use for entertainment. In this EDA, I will explore the netflix-shows dataset through visualizations and graphs using matplotlib and seaborn.","78390d22":"Now we will look into the duration of Netflix films. Since movies are measured in time and shows are measured by seasons, we need to split the dataset between movies and TV shows. Above on the left, we can see that the duration for Netflix movies closely resembles a normal distribution with the average viewing time spanning about 90 minutes which seems to make sense. Netflix TV shows on the other hand seems to be heavily skewed to the right where the majority of shows only have 1 season.","292ef03c":"### Who are the top 10 actors on Netflix based on number of titles?","dad50e63":"# Asking and Answering Questions","a72f8166":"Above in the heatmap and table, we can see that there are quite a few null values in the dataset. There are a total of 3,036 null values across the entire dataset with 1,969 missing points under 'director', 570 under 'cast', 476 under 'country', 11 under 'date_added', and 10 under 'rating'. We will have to handle all null data points before we can dive into EDA and modeling.","098b568f":"### Splitting the Dataset\nSince the dataset can either contain movies or shows, it'd be nice to have datasets for both so we can take a deep dive into just Netflix movies or Netflix TV shows so we will create two new datasets. One for movies and the other one for shows.","76f05fc9":"### Netflix Film Ratings\nNow, we will explore the ratings which are based on the film rating system. The ordering of the ratings will be based on the age of the respective audience from youngest to oldest. We will not include the ratings 'NR' and 'UR' in the visuals since they stand for unrated and non-rated content.","5654c122":"### How does the timeline look like for the addition of International Movies compared to International TV Shows?","30b016c0":"In this list, we can see that the most popular actors on Netflix based on the number of titles are all international as well. This reinforces the sentiment that the majority of Netflix subscribers are international.","2dd0574f":"As stated previously regarding the top genres, it's no surprise that the most popular directors on Netflix with the most titles are mainly international as well.","7e761999":"Overall, there is much more content for a more mature audience. For the mature audience, there is much more movie content than there are TV shows. However, for the younger audience (under the age of 17), it is the opposite, there are slightly more TV shows than there are movies.","0e5dc5d9":"### Handling Null Values\nWe can see that for each of the columns, there are alot different unique values for some of them. It makes sense that show_id is large since it is a unique key used to identify a movie\/show. Title, director, cast, country, date_added, listed_in, and description contain many unique values as well.","94688520":"### Netflix Film Duration","6bb15db4":"### Loading the Dataset\nNow we are ready to load the dataset. We will do this using the standard read_csv command from Pandas. Let's take a glimpse at how the data looks like.","66ffe6c2":"# Inferences and Conclusion\nIt's clear that Netflix has grown over the years. We can see it from the data that the company took certain approaches in their marketing strategy to break into new markets around the world. Based on an article from Business Insider, Netflix had about 158 million subscribers worldwide with 60 million from the US and almost 98 million internationally. Netflix's original subscriber base was based solely in the United States following its IPO. A large part of its success was due to the decision to expand to international markets. The popular markets prioritizes what content the company will release. In this case, we can see that a good amount of international movies and TV shows were added over the years as part of Netflix's global expansion.","5d986a12":"# Exploratory Analysis and Visualization","dbb7c586":"Based on the timeline, we can see that there are far more international movie releases than there are international tv show releases. However, near 2018, the growth of international movies started to decline while international tv shows constantly showed significant growth in the past few years.","10e111d8":"So there are roughly 4,000+ movies and almost 2,000 shows with movies being the majority. This makes sense since shows are always an ongoing thing and have episodes. If we were to do a headcount of TV show episodes vs. movies, I am sure that TV shows would come out as the majority. However, in terms of title, there are far more movie titles (68.5%) than TV show titles (31.5%).","50fe5518":"### Countries with the most content available","3b9a39e9":"### Content added each year\nNow we will take a look at the amount content Netflix has added throughout the previous years. Since we are interested in when Netflix added the title onto their platform, we will add a 'year_added' column shows the year of the date from the 'date_added' column as shown above.","1a4de95d":"### Who are the top 10 directors on Netflix with the most releases?","6f224ab3":"### Netflix Film Types: Movie or TV Show\nIt'd be interesting to see the comparison between the total number of movies and shows in this dataset just to get an idea of which one is the majority.","49077e83":"### Popular Genres","2f015ae9":"After a quick glimpse at the dataset, it looks like a typical movies\/shows dataset without user ratings. We can also see that there are NaN values in some columns.","ba2ca740":"### Package Install and Import\nFirst, we will install and import necessary packages.","db178cde":"For null values, the easiest way to get rid of them would be to delete the rows with the missing data. However, this wouldn't be beneficial to our EDA since there is loss of information. Since 'director', 'cast', and 'country' contain the majority of null values, I will choose to treat each missing value as unavailable. The other two labels 'date_added' and 'rating' contains an insignificant portion of the data so I will drop them from the dataset. After, we can see that there are no more null values in the dataset.","18aafd91":"Now we will explore the countries with the most content on Netflix. Films typically are available in multiple countries as shown in the original dataset. Therefore, we need to seperate all countries within a film before we can analyze the data. After seperating countries and removing titles with no countries available, we can plot a Top 20 list to see which countries have the highest availability of films on Netflix. Unsurprisingly, the United States stands out on top since Netflix is an American company. India surprisingly comes in second followed by the UK and Canada. China interestingly is not even close to the top even though it has about 18% of the world's population. Reasons for this could be for political reasons and the banning of certain applications which isn't uncommon between the United States and China.","0bed0033":"# Future Work\n* IMDB Ratings Analysis on Netflix Movies & TV Shows\n* Recommender System\n* More pretty seaborn graphs?","0330dc5a":"In the heatmap above, we can see that a majority of international movies were added throughout the year in 2018. Then in December 2019, Netflix added the most international movie content.","9ca90dae":"In the above heatmap, we can see that around 2014 is when Netflix began to increase their content count. We can see over the years and months, Netflix continues to slowly increase the amount of content that is being added into their platform. We can see in 2020, the data stops at January since that is the latest month available in the dataset.","3cf3b6da":"### Data Preparation\nIn the duration column, there appears to be a discrepancy between movies and shows. Movies are based on the duration of the movie and shows are based on the number of seasons. To make EDA easier, I will convert the values in these columns into integers for both the movies and shows datasets.","3a5776ec":"# References\n* https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/shivamb\/netflix-shows\n* https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/netflix-growth-comes-from-international-markets-2019-10","79757e6f":"First we will begin analysis on the entire Netflix dataset consisting of both movies and shows.
