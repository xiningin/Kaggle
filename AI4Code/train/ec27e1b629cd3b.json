But because the heatmap already showed the limited number of correlated variables, we'll look at each of the highly correlated variables seperately.\n\nNote : I take a sample of the train data to speed up the process.","f99aa9b1":"#### ps_reg_02 and ps_reg_03\n\nAs the regression line shows, there is a linear relationship between these variables. Thanks to the hue parameter we can see that the regression lines for target=0 and target=1 are the same.","ca9b7908":"We indeed see the following\n\n- binary variables\n- categorical variables of which the category values are integers\n- other variables with integer or float values\n- variables with -1 representing missing values\n- the target variable and an ID variable\n\nLet's look at the number of rows and columns in the train data.","4ab21127":"There are a strong correlations between the variables:\n\n- ps_reg_02 and ps_reg_03 (0.7)\n- ps_car_12 and ps_car_13 (0.67)\n- ps_car_14 and ps_car_12 (0.58)\n- ps_car_13 and ps_car_15 (0.53)","59f2bf2f":"## Descriptive statistics\n\nWe can also apply the describe method on the dataframe. However, it doesn't make much sense to calculate the mean, std, ... on categorical variables and the id variable. We'll explore the categorical variables visually later.\n\nThanks to our meta file we can easily select the variables on which to compute the descriptive statistics. To keep things clear, we'll do this per data type.","fd1418c0":"Again, with the info() method we see that the data type is integer or float. No null values are present in the data set. That's normal because missing vlaues are replaced by -1. We'll look into that later.","516a85dc":"We have 59 variables and 595,212 rows. Let's see if wee have the same number of variables in the test data.\n\nLet's see if there are duplicate rows in the training data.","50005b1f":"Below the number of variables per role and level are displayed","599c9ba5":"## Data at first sight\n\nHere is and except of the data description for the competition:\n\n- Features that belong to similar groupings are tagged as such in the features names (e.g ind, reg, car, calc)\n- Features names include the postfix bin to indicate binary features and cat to indicate categorical features.\n- Features without these designations are either continuous or ordinal.\n- Values of -1 indicate that the feature was missing from the observations.\n- The target columns signifies whether or not a claim was filed for that policy holder.\n\nOk, that's important information to get us started. Let's have a quick look at the first and last rows to confirm all of this.","231db715":"#### Ordinal variables"}}
