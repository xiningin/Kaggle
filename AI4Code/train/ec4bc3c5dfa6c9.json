However, I can still see if I was able to seperate classes in any kind of meaningful way! It looks like group 1 has a vast majority of the 2nd and 3rd class tickets. The other groups are almost exclusivly 1st class.","b3c11ff3":"# Conclusion\n\nThanks for making it this far. the basic K-Means put most of the non-first class passengers into 1 group (Group 1). The other groups had different segments of first class passengers. Some traveled with family, while others paid very high amounts for their tickets. More work can be done to see if there is a better clustering model to help explain the data.\n\nWas this helpful? Are you interested in more unsupervised learning? Let me know in the comments.","1d8f1db1":"Looks like 5 is the best number of clusters based on inertia","34d42ed9":"## Setup","c6305c58":"# Analysis\n\nWith 5 groups there is a bit of imbalance. \n\n### Group 0\n\n* The second largest class\n* Seems to be made up mostly of siblings.\n\n---\n\n### Group 1 \n* seems to be heavily 2nd and 3dr class passenger. \n* There is a fair amount of 1st class, but not as many as group 1. \n* Seems to be 75% male\n* Most people in this group did not survive.\n\n-----\n\n### Group 2\n\n* This groups seems to be traveling with the most children\n* They also paid the second most for tickets\n\n---\n\n### Group 3 \n\n* small population, but seems to have more females traving with siblings or children.\n\n---\n\n### Group 4 \n    \n* just 3 people who paid the most for their ticket. \n* They seem to be outliers as far as Fare goes\n* 100% survived in this group\n\n\n","984b9471":"# Titanic Unsupervised KMeans\n\nThe goal of this is to look at the titanic data from a clustering perspective. I will do some basic cleaning and a simple K-Means fit. Then I will perform cluster analysis. I do not check very closly to see if my K-Means did a good job, I just want to analyze the clusters. Normally one might try different models with different hyperparameters.","c9033c01":"sex and embarked are categorical.

This way I can look at what group each row got assigned to!","384f23f9":"# Clustering\n\nUsing K-Means, I will check the inertia to determine the # of clusters. Next I will determine what each cluster seems to be telling me about the data"}}
