This method tells us a lot of things about a dataset. One important thing is that the `describe()` method deals only with numeric values. It doesn't work with any categorical values. \n\nNow, let's understand the statistics that are generated by the `describe()` method:\n\n* `count` tells us the number of `NoN-empty` rows in a feature.\n\n* `mean` tells us the mean value of that feature.\n\n* `std` tells us the Standard Deviation Value of that feature.\n\n* `min` tells us the minimum value of that feature.\n\n* `25%`, `50%`, and `75%` are the percentile\/quartile of each features. This quartile information helps us to detect [Outliers](https:\/\/machinelearningmastery.com\/how-to-identify-outliers-in-your-data\/).\n\n* `max` tells us the maximum value of that feature.\n","071a28d3":"## Histogram of Each Feature\nA [Histogram](https:\/\/matplotlib.org\/api\/_as_gen\/matplotlib.pyplot.hist.html) is the most commonly used graph to show frequency distributions.","41acc244":"## Custom correlogram\nA [pair plot](https:\/\/seaborn.pydata.org\/generated\/seaborn.pairplot.html) allows us to see both distribution of single variables and relationships between two variables.\n\nLots of things are going on in the below pair plot. Let\u2019s try to understand the __pair plot__. In __pair plot__, there are mainly two things that we need to understand. One is the __distribution of a feature__ and another is the __relationship between one feature to all others__. If we look at the diagonal we can see the distribution of each feature. Let\u2019s consider the `first row X first column`, this diagonal shows us the distribution of `pelvic_incidence`. Similarly, if we look at the `second row X second column` diagonal we can see the distribution of `pelvic_tilt`. All the cells except the diagonals show the relationship between one feature to another. Let\u2019s consider the `first row X second column`, here we can the relationship between `pelvic_incidence` and `pelvic_tilt`.\n\n","9aa0b125":"### Visualize the number of abnormal and normal cases \nThe tendency of `abnormal` cases is 2 times higher than the `normal` cases.","1fd00f84":"## Feature Scaling\n[Feature scaling](http:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/auto_examples\/preprocessing\/plot_scaling_importance.html) though standardization (or Z-score normalization) can be an important preprocessing step for many machine learning algorithms. Our dataset contain features with highly varying in magnitudes, units and range. But since, most of the machine learning algorithms use Eucledian distance between two data points in their computations, this will create a problem. To avoid this effect, we need to bring all features to the same level of magnitudes. This can be acheived by [feature scaling](https:\/\/medium.com\/greyatom\/why-how-and-when-to-scale-your-features-4b30ab09db5e).","520d84f0":"# Lower Back Pain\n\n[Lower back pain](https:\/\/www.healthline.com\/health\/back-pain), also called __lumbago__, is not a disorder.

Of those, 50 percent will have more than one episode within a year. In 90 percent of all cases, the pain gets better without surgery.
