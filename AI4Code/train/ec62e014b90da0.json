The number of groups within an industry and their composition depends on the dimensions used to define the groups. Strategic management professors and consultants often make use of a two dimensional grid to position firms along an industry's two most important dimensions in order to distinguish direct rivals (those with similar strategies or business models) from indirect rivals. ","d3dccf34":"# Objective \nThe main objective of this report is to be able to identify the strategic group of a car given a set of features to that car.\n\nThe Car we want to identify the strategic group for is Toyota Corolla which is known as Corolla Altis in india\n\n<center><img src='https:\/\/imgd.aeplcdn.com\/1056x594\/cw\/ec\/26588\/Toyota-Corolla-Altis-Exterior-114986.jpg?wm=1&q=85' width='500' height='%00'><\/center>\n\nThe Corolla is a world wide best seller and it has been sold for many years, but as the automotive market became full of comptitiors an extensive analysis is needed to identifiy the strategic group competing with the company in the market\n\n### Approach \nThis report will follow a mathematical approach using a method called clustring to achive the objective of identifying strategic group.","5c036861":"> #### We can see the the clusters are strongly affected by the price with clear speration between clusters but it's kind of blurry when it comes to power","d2f320be":"#### Since the dataset is full of features, we will choose only a subset of  useful features to work with, also we will clean the data to extract useful information","d6489f2d":"It's now clear that we have to look to many dimensions in order to cluster the market, as the more features we explore the harder it's to cluster the market.\nThese dimensions affect the decision of the buyers not to mention it also precvied totally different due to the very different mental models of buyers, in other words, price horsepower and mileage are not everything, some buyers would like to have a long wheel base car, some would like to have wider car all of the previous features, and more, strongly affect the buyer' decisions.\n\nThis means that two car can have very similar price and milage but one is a van with lots of space and the other is just a four doors sedan, these two cars are precieved as two different categories in the automotive industry so space \"length width and height of the car\" can also be a vital factor.","4729e31f":"<a id='clus'><\/a>\n# [Clustering](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cluster_analysis) \nCluster analysis or clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar (in some sense) to each other than to those in other groups (clusters).
