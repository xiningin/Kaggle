The code below uses the [`cross_val_score()`](https:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/generated\/sklearn.model_selection.cross_val_score.html) function to obtain the mean absolute error (MAE), averaged across five different folds.

Thankfully, scikit-learn also contains a built-in function [`GridSearchCV()`](https:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/generated\/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html) that can make your grid search code very efficient!\n\n# Keep going\n\nContinue to learn about **[gradient boosting](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/alexisbcook\/xgboost)**, a powerful technique that achieves state-of-the-art results on a variety of datasets.","74d9947e":"---\n\n\n\n\n*Have questions or comments?
