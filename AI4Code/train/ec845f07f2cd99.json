The demand during morning and afternoon hours from the Airport to City is quite low, which means that a driver who completed a City to Airport route in the morning hours may have to wait a really long time to get a ride back to the City, or he may have to come back without a passenger. Both situations are not idle for drivers, which might be the reason for highest number of \"Cancelled\" trips in the City to Airport trip in the morning hours\n\n2. The vice versa happens in evening when there are too many flight coming in to the airport and hence there is a high demand for cabs and not enough supply. which is why most number of \"No Cars Available\" were observed in Evening in the Airport to City route."}}
