The dataset selected is the _Pok\u00e9mon_ available [here](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/abcsds\/pokemon)! It is an easy and fun database to start using our most basic tools and play around without feeling pressure from competitions.\n\nThe structure of this notebook is the following:\n1. Data exploration: first peak at the data.\n2. More data reviewing!\n3. Data cleaning.\n4. Classification models: predicting character's legendary status and main type.\n5. Regression models: predicting character's HP.\n\nThe idea is that just after performing some action, it is justified so everyone can learn the reasond behind that decision. In data science, is easy to find someone that can simply type code mindlessly. The real challenge is to make all decisions and processes based on a strong foundation. Therefore, if something is not clear enough, I encourage you to ask it in the comments section so we can discuss about it! :)\n\n---\nThe parts already covered are:\n1. `[x] Data exploration: first peak at the data.`\n2. `[ ] More data reviewing!` <- coming soon\n3. `[ ] Data cleaning.` <- coming soon\n4. `[ ] Classification models: predicting character's legendary status and main type.` <- coming soon\n5. `[ ] Regression models: predicting character's HP.` <- coming soon\n---\n","73cf191e":"### 1.4 Insights from `.describe()`\n* It is clear that the stats for the number (i.e. column '#') does not provide any information.\n* 'Total' allows us to see what is the distribution of available points for any character.\n* The following stats show the distribution of each stat. Seems that, given that the mean and the median (i.e. 50%) are close to each other, they seem to follow a normal distribution.\n* The generation is a categorical variable. Therefore, the description doesn't provide anything useful.\n* Since all variables have the same count as the dataset size, we can conclude that these variables have no missing values.","355614de":"### 1.8 Insights from categorical variables:\n* Both `Type_` variables have a big amount of categories. This will can be counter productive when trying to learn a model.\n* `Type_2` has a big amount of missing values that represent 386\/800=0.48 of the data.","06bdabf5":"### 1.1 Simple facts about the dataset\n\nCheck the variables of the dataset and obtain a few descriptive statistics.","3d4d0840":"### 1.3 `unique()` and `describe()`\n\nLet's say that we want to know what are the unique Pok\u00e9mons that we have:","38146f9a":"### 2.1 Cleaning outliers\n\nFirst, let's define a function that it going to help us doing the analysis process simpler.","abbbe0b3":"### 1.6 Insights (II)\n* Interessantly enough, it can be seen that eventhough most of the variables seem to follow the same KDE, `Speed` is different for generation 4 with respect of the rest. Likewise with the `Defense`. One could think that the designers of the Pok\u00e9mon did a bit more innovative characters in that generation.\n* The outliers are from different generations. It would also be interesting to see if they are of the same `Type_1`, `Type_2`, `Legendary` or not. It will be done further down in the more advanced analysis.","368ff612":"#### Research 2:\nWhy are there so many non legendary outliers? Maybe they are the _Mega_ versions of some characters, let's check it out.","03de6d5a":"### 1.6 Insights\n* We can see that most of the data is right skewed since all histograms have most of the values in the left.\n* Also we can see that some variables seem to be correlated: for instance the HP and the Attack.\n* It can be seen also that there are outliers in the data. For instance, in the HP vs. Attack it looks that they are highly correlated but it doesn't if we plot Attack vs. HP. When the data has not many outliers, changing the order of the variables should not alter the correlation.","b6422619":"## 1. Data exploration: first peak at the data\n\nReminder: the variable types are the following.\n* __Nominal__: names, gender... Variables that have not really an intrinsic numerical value. Categories are nominal variables.\n* __Ordinal__: scales, education degrees... Numerical variables that have order but they do not display proportions (e.g. _very good_ does not necessarily mean that it is the double of _good_ but simply that it is in a higher position).\n* __Discrete__: number of chairs in a room, days in the calendar... Natural numbers (i.e. with no decimals, e.g. 0, 4, 129, -12).\n* __Real__: height, weight... Numbers from the Real numbers set (i.e. any non-complex number, e.g. 0.9182, $\\sqrt{34}$).","51936f70":"### 2.2 Insigths from outlier analysis\n1. We can breakdown the 125 outliers into: 41 Legendary, 26 Mega and 84 Normal outliers.\n2. As we can see, there are 65 Legendary Pok\u00e9mons, of which only 41 have stats that are not represented in the 95% of the rest of the Pok\u00e9mon.\n3. There are, therefore, 24 Legendary Pok\u00e9mons with not so special stats.\n4. We need to treat the Legendary characters different.\n5. From the rest, the Mega versions are really different from the normal versions.\n6. We need to treat Mega characters different as well!\n7. We can drop the normal Pok\u00e9mons.\n\n----\n\nOne option to work with the outliers is simply to drop them, which is what I'm going to be doing here. However, other methods of outlier treatment could be easily implemented. They include methods like:\n* Treating the feature in which they are outliers as a random variable coming form a certain probability distribution and assign a random number from that distribution.\n* Same as before but assigning them an extreme value in the distribution.\n* Change the value by the mean, median or mode.","b50569ec":"With that we can see that we have 13 columns the following data:\n1. Number of Pok\u00e9mon (discrete variable).\n2. Name of the Pok\u00e9mon (nominal variable).\n3. Its main type (nominal variable).\n4. Secondary type (nominal variable).\n5. Total: sum of Attack, Defense, Special Attak and Special Defense points (discrete variable).\n6. Stats for fighting that add up to the total (discrete variable).\n7. Generation that it was first seen (nominal variable).\n8. Whether or not the Pok\u00e9mon is legendary (nominal variable).\n\nIn reality, the stats could be real variables (e.g. Pikachu could have a HP of 34.8 instead of 35) that have been discretized in this dataset.","3ab0274f":"Eventhough it's a lot of them, not all Legendary characters are actually special!","883c076d":"### 1.2 Insights from `.columns`\n* We have columns with spaces in their names and punctuation symbols (e.g. \".\").\n* The number of the pokemon is called with a __reserved__ `python` symbol.","3d91ed43":"## Summary part 1\n* Data is pretty clean and straightforward.\n* We had to rename some columns to avoid further problems.\n* Seems like there are some outliers seen in the numerical variables that we will have to take into account in next steps.\n* Similarly, the categorical variables have probably too many categories and some have a high amount of missing values.\n\n---","2943331c":"### 1.7 Categorical variables overview\n\nLet's continue with the analysis for the non-numerical variables.

Let's check it out.","c09eb3dc":"After the insights we have gained it is obvious we have to solve two problems:\n*  In general, naming things with spaces is not recommended. One of the reasons is that if we want to quickly access the feature (e.g. pressing `Tab`), we won't find it and we will have to be typed completely. It is better to replace all spaces with underscores.\n* We need to fix the column with the reserved symbol as well.\n\nLet's fix the columns renaming them :)!"}}
