Hence we need to remove that feature and train the Deep Learning model.","c21eafd0":"# This notebook is derived from the following notebooks. Many thanks!!\n1. Abhishek Thakur - https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/abhishek\/autoxgb-nov-2021-tps\n### features used in this notebook came from, again many thanks!\n1. https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/maximkazantsev\/tps-11-21-eda-xgboost-optuna\n","c3be2ad4":"# So the model predicts 52 percent of test as 1's similar to what Train data has (50 percent) are 1's. So we may be on the right track though other AutoML programs take 8 hours on this same dataset. So they might produce better results but take far too long compared to Deep_AutoViML. That's the distinguishing feature of Deep_AutoViML: you get a performant model in 5 mins or less even for a very large dataset like Nov TPS."}}
