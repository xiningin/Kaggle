Unsurprisingly, the coronavirus is also high on the list of concerns for Americans, with 73 percent of the respondents fearing that they or their family might get sick with COVID-19.\n\nAccording to a recent survey conducted by the New York Times and Siena College, many Americans fear for democracy itself, as 76 percent of the respondents say that they are concerned about their country\u2019s status as one of the world\u2019s most famous democracies. Leading up to the election, Americans seem less concerned with personal, short-term problems such as falling victim to crime or losing their job, but more with the general direction their country is taking.\n\nAs election day is underway, Americans are anxiously waiting for the outcome of what many consider the most important election of their lifetime. Here is a country so divided that retailers are barricading their stores in fear of post-election violence and where even a peaceful transition of power, a hallmark of America\u2019s democracy for more than 200 years, is no longer considered a guarantee.\nhttps:\/\/www.statista.com\/chart\/23375\/key-concerns-ahead-of-2020-election\/"}}
