This category has a very broad possible cases what can go wrong with CVC placement in your body.\n\nI manually inspected training data and split `CVC - Abnormal` category into two main ones:\n\n- `CVC - Abnormal - Right Atrium` - most common abnormality, when CVC is inserted too deep into the heart\n- `CVC - Abnormal - Other` - all other abnormalities, which include bad CVC line trajectory, CVC kinkings and other abnormalities.\n\nThe dataset is provided in https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/raddar\/ranzcr-clip-abnormal-cvc-categories which maps to competition training data annotations by `index` column.\n\nThis information is potentially useful if you are going to train detectors.","43e07970":"The tip of CVC is clearly way too deep into the heart.

This is also known as CVC tip placement in Right Atrium. However, this is only one type of possible abnormalities (although most common one).\n\n- If the tip of CVC is above compared to reference image, this another kind of abnormality, caused due to many reasons of CVC insertion failures - line going in wrong venaes, CVC kinking, etc.\n","b99643b2":"This a common abnormality, when the CVC trajectory goes into other venae - in this case to the neck.

This is very subjective as radiologists could disagree if its borderline or not quite often.","fea6e669":"### Abnormal - Other","4ee3bb33":"## Different CVC - Abnormal categories - what's next?\n\nI have shown that `CVC - Abnormal` category should not be treated as a homogenous feature of CVC - it clearly has many different forms of possible abnormalities.\n\nThis might be useful when validating classifiers. However, the biggest benefit might come if one builds detection\/segmentation models.\n\nAfter all, CVC classification task is the hardest problem of the competition - even small gains can lead to huge AUC differences on the LB.","c144b9b6":"This is a typical case of CVC kinking - when the tip of CVC is kinked during insertion procedure."}}
