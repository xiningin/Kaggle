So, based on this reference, we can note that there is a tricky fact here about the missing values of Markdown, CPI and Unemployment. \n\n**In markdown, it concentrates the missing values in training dataset. However, in CPI and Unemployment, the missing values are in test dataset.**\n\nIt means that how we full in the markdown\u2019s missing values will affect our training model. The CPI and Unemployment missing values will affect our test model results.\nWell, if I have more time, maybe I would try to do a forecast exercise to find a suitable CPI and Unemployment. But, I believe that an interpolation is enough, because as we have seen it, there is a very clear dominant trend along the period in both series. So, an interpolation is ok here (just some few observations to fill). This is not the perfect world, but this is the life.\n\nWith markdown, at the beginning I was thinking to create a dummy, then go with the flow. Now with this information, if a create a dummy, maybe I will lose a lot of important forecast explanation (error). I am thinking to fill it with the mean group by Store, dept, temperature and holiday. Because it will \u2018maintain\u2019 the main \u2018individuals\u2019 features of each markdown according with its store, dept (place) and temperature, holiday (seasonal\/time aspect).","a8e7181e":"Let's have a look what we have in the features dataset:","eaab5ec1":"Since this is a problem of forecast with a reasonable dataset, the suitable models that I would apply are: SGD, Lasso, ElasticNet, Ridge Regression, SVR and Ensemble Regressors. Ensemble regressors are techniques to combine the predictions of several base estimators built with a learning algorithm to improve robustness over a single estimator.\n\nInside of Ensemble regressors, there are averaging (Bagging, Forest random trees, etc) and boosting methods (AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting trees, etc). \nI applied the XGboost because the implementation is easy and fast. Besides, the result from boosting algorithm with tree ensembles (set of classification and regression trees) is fantastic.\n\nXGBoost is well recognised to produce stronger results than other machine learning models. It has grown into the most popular algorithm to handle with structured data. XGboost uses the gradient boosting (GBM) framework at its core. It is an optimised distributed gradient boosting library that controls the bias and variance aspects, combining several weak models to produce a powerful ensemble. One important step to achieve satisfactory results is tune its parameters. \n\nParameters are essential to give the right \u2018orientation\u2019 for the sequential models. Generic speaking, there are 3 main categorical parameters: 1) Three-Specific Parameters (regularisation of the individuals models), 2) Boosting parameters (controls the boosting operation) and 3) Other general parameters to maintain the operation. \n\nI will start with cross validation. Then I will apply a Gridsearch method to make my life more easier in parameter tunning. After it, I will train the model in the training set, then test its results in validation set for final adjustment. At the end, with the last model, I will submit it.","f51bb8b1":"I am a kind of person who like old school style.

In one graph and few lines of code, we can visualise a lot of information. For instance, from the box plot above, it is possible to see:\n\n- Type A contain the largest stores. The average size is around 180,000. Also, the variance of the size seems to be higher than B and C. \n- Type B is a kind of \u2018medium\u2019 store with average size by almost 100,000.

Otherwise, drop a message to me. ","16a598c3":"From those who like time series tools, the decomposition is the first thing you should do. Basically, it breaks the time series down into systematic and unsystematic components.\n\nTo do it, I did a little manipulation to have a one big series. This series is not considering the individuals aspects, just the total of weekly sales per date.","d3e07ee6":"I liked this model. Although we can apply more treatments to minimise the error, I think the features are very well balanced. \n\nIf the Walmart\u2019s shareholders asked to me: \u2018According to your model, what are the most important features that impact our sales and why?\u2019\n\nI would say:\n\n- CPI: it is a proxy of our price and also represents the power of our consumer\u2019s consumption. For this reason, it is responsible to positive and negative values.\n- Unemployment: it is the thermometer of our potential market, more people working, more potential market and the other way around. \n- Temperature: it is our seasonal variable correlated with months and special dates (end of the year). \n- Markdowns: I was expecting only positive affects here. Because there are some markdowns related with special dates. But, one hypothesis that can explain this \u2018dual\u2019 impact, it is because some markdowns only happens when the sales are decreasing. So, considering that my assumption to fill the missing values was back interpolate it, maybe the model are getting this delay correlation between negative sales and markdowns. \n- Fuel price: it is the cost of opportunity, for this reason, when the price of the fuel is high, the sales decrease. Also, the fuel price can effect the last price of the products. \n\nSo, one shareholder could ask: \u2018why you did not make any comment about the categorical variables (dept and type)?\n\nI am very careful to include a lot of categorical variables without understanding very well the meaning of each one. Because it can contain a lot of features with high potential of explanation concentrate in just one variable. \nIf I am just forecasting and taking part in the forecasting competition, ok, perfect, I would include all the categorical variables. Because it will minimise the error,\nfor sure!\n\nBut if it was in my job, I don\u2019t know. Here of forecasting sales, I am not sure if this kind of model are sustainable in the mid and long term.\nFor instance, imaging that we have a company that sells fish and chips. Then, we bought a huge database of our consumers classified by \u2018ID\u2019, their demand by fish and chips and other features. Then someone included the column \u2018ID\u2019 into the model. Ow, perfect, the model explain very well everything, nice job. In the next month, new consumers and new \u2018IDs\u2019 starting to appear and disappear. So, how we are going to to forecast \u2018ID\u2019 of our future consumers to still using our model? It makes little sense. \n\nIn this case, dept and store are our \u2018IDs\u2019. Inside of each \u2018ID\u2019, there are \u2018swallow\u2019 features that we do not include, because there are not available dataset and we are not allowed to add external variables. If it was allowed, we could include series that represents recent trends in consumer behaviours, the competitors movement (digital stores, such as amazon), education profile, etc. It is not the dept or store that explain the sales per se, but what it is inside of this categorical variables. For this reason, I only included the top 3 dept in sales in my model (probably, it represents the most popular products). If I included all those categorical features, we are over-fitting our model. \n\nWhy it works very well in the prediction, if I add the column store and dept? Because most stores and dept are constant in both datasets (train and test set), in this case there is no difference in result. Once again, it is okay to include these variables for the forecast. However, as well as in time series models, we can not use this model (with a lot of categorical features) to understand the impact of each action into the sales.","680200d6":"Ho-Ho-Ho!\n\nIn only two months, Thanksgiving (Black Friday) and Christmas represent almost 25% of the total sales that the stores have done during all the rest of the year! Yeah, Santa Claus smiles. \n\nBut for us, it will demand a special attention, because this peak distorts our series pattern. To treat it, maybe a dummy is enough.","5f152fe9":"CPI and Unemployment has an negative correlation. It was expetected, because high unemployment, less jobs, less demand to consume, then the inflation (CPI) going down.  \n\nOther correlation that we can destak is markdown 1 and 4, maybe in less intensity markdown 5. In this case, it is a positive correlation","8dd0351d":"**Correlation:**\n\nIt is important to understand the correlation between explanatory variables, because we need to avoid multicollinearity. \n\nMulticollinearity does not reduce the predictive power, but it can affect our coefficient\u2019s estimation. So, if you are doing a model, sometimes is an excellent idea to know which coefficients are more important. To do it, we should deal with explanatory variables that has high correlation.","46bd6b34":"**Feature Selection**\n\nThis is the time to back to our annotations and think a little about it. The feature selection is the consequence of our data analysis.\nSo, ok, which variables and why? \n\n- Size: No. Because I have seen that type and size are very correlated. So, I prefer to put a dummy of type. I am a little afraid to put variables that have big deviations. I prefer to avoid this kind of variables. \n- Temperature: Yes. It is our seasonal element. It will help us fit some aspects that can vary according with the season of the year\n- Fuel price: Yes. It can be a proxy of the cost of opportunities to buy, and also it has a \u2018individual\u2019 component.\n- Markdowns: Yes, but only some of them. Markdown 1 and 4 are very correlated. So, I will exclude the 4 (more original missing values)\n- CPI: yes. It is our proxy about the prices in the retail sector. It also works as a proxy about the power of consumption.\n- Unemployment: yes. It is our proxy to demand and power of consumption. \n- dummies: yes. All of them. It is our categorical variables. We have seen that the sales are different among different dept, type, store and holiday. \n\n**Internal comment:** we should consider a variable that represents the concurrency such as the demand by on-line products or the price of the concurrency. Other important variable to retail is there is the level of scholarly and age of the population. But it is not allowed to import external dataset, otherwise we could use some google trends series as a proxy.\n","c2c00517":"**Features engineering**","9ac64044":"So, these peaks represent almost 20% of the total sales in their respective years.

Then, I will compare this amount with the value of the 2011\u2019s peak. The idea is to figure out the real importance of these events in the Total sales.\n","3e66c747":"Ok, good.

However, this is not the pre-processing stage yet. Maybe, it is the preparation for it. \n\nMy focus here is weekly sales.","a5ea66ac":"**Dummies!** \n\nYeah, everybody loves dummies. But, we need to be careful to not use too much dummies and overfit our model. \n\nWhen we are working with dummy variables, we need only (n-1) dummy variables. For instance, if we are working with dummies to treat month, we can not create dummies for all months. We need to pick one month and excluded it. This month \u2018excluded\u2019 will be our \u2018control\u2019. \n\nWhy? Because, when all month\u2019s dummy is zero, the remain value is related to our control variable.\n\nOk, but which variables you made dummy? I chose almost all the categorical variables. Because some models did not perform with categorical variables (Xgboost, regression models, etc): \n\n- Dept: yes, it is categorical. Although it is a number, this is not a sequence of values. It is only the classification of the dept. Be careful, the risk to consider it as a \u2018ordinal\u2019 is created a super variable that will explain everything - as we have seen, the sales are very correlated with the dept. \n- Type\n- IsHoliday \n- Size (Same case with the dept. It is a kind of categorical variable. But I will exclude it, so I did not create a dummy) \n\n**Back to the Future:**\n\nAfter running the Machine Learning model, I found that there are too much dummies. Although I wrote the message at the beginning and the error of the model looks great, the model looks like over-fitting. For this reason, I did only some few dummies: Type and Is Holiday and some dept.","e67e1534":"After merge it, I am going to do some exercises.

There is a systematic error, almost a seasonal error along the period. The other fun thing is the \u2018peak\u2019. There is a negative peak at the end of the year! Why? \n\nProbably Type C is a kind of super premium store. Wall Mart is a popular store in which its profit comes from the diversity and quantity of products it sells. For this reason, Wall Mart stores are enormous. However, as we have seen above, the size of Type C is the smallest. Because of it, my hypothesis is that Type C only sells special products for special people. Which kind of store did not sell at the end of the year? Or their customers are travelling or the stores are closed. \n\nOk, but this is only a hypothesis. Unfortunately, we can not confirm it with the information that we have here.

I really appreciated your attention until this conclusion!\n\nThank you!","3547c24d":"\n\nXGBoost gets efficiency gains by utilizing its own optimized data structure for datasets called a DMatrix.","56636e5a":"source: [ScikitLearn](http:\/\/https:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/tutorial\/machine_learning_map\/index.html)","009d416f":"To be honest, I am not a big fan to apply line graph to analyse panel data. We can miss a plenty of \u2018individual\u2019 information. However, if we want to have just a general idea of what is going on and we do not want to waste too much time on this task, so, ok. Line plot can give to us a pleasant sight of the general dynamic along the time.\nThe cool thing is that we can see the dominant trend (the darkest line in the middle of the line) and also the \u2018individual trends\u2019 (light line colour). There are no huge deviations along the series. However, sometimes, we can note some exceptions such as in 2013-01 with fuel price.\n\nIn this date, the Fuel-price had a considerable variation between the stores. This event can affect negatively our estimation. But I believe that it is too early to suffer with this expectation. I will put this information in my pocket to consult it during the modelling stage.\n\nOk, but which more useful insights we can takeaway?\n\nFrom the interactive graph above, we can point out:\n\n- Temperature: it is a seasonal data from a Northern Hemisphere weather (Winter at the end of the year and Summer in the middle)\n- Fuel_Price: although there is considerable fluctuation in the fuel's evolution price, we can also note a positive trend along the period.\n- Markdown 1: high volatility, but with a considerable volume of promotions with two peaks along the period\n- Markdown 2: less volume of with promotions with a few peaks distributed along of the series\n- Markdown 3: a series with only two peaks of promotion. But these two promotions are the highest values between the markdowns.\n- Markdown 4: very similar with markdown 1 (high correlation). Similar dynamic with two peaks in the same period.\n- Markdown 5: very similar with markdown 1 and 4 (high correlation). However, in a very \u2018shy\u2019 way, because there is less amount of promotional.\n- CPI: there is a substantial variation between stores (the light-blue line) with a positive trend along the period.\n- Unemployment: like a CPI, there is a considerable variation between stores. However, in this case, we can note a downtrend.\n- Isholiday: a boolean variable with few observations along the period (4 per year). It is important to note that the four holidays (Super Bowl, labor day, Thanksgiving\/Black Friday and Christmas) are already considered here, but others are missing, such as Easter, Father\u2019s and Mother\u2019s day. In pre-processing stage, we need to include it\n\n**Internal comments:**\u00a0So, from here, some ideas starting to appear in my mind and I would like to put it on the table now. Because it will help us find our path when we are doing the feature\u2019s engineering to complement these explanatory variables.\n\nIt will help us have some feelings of which kind of machine learning model we should use here. For those who have experience with economic variables, we can also have the first sensations about the impact of the independent variables into weekly sales. Let\u2019s have a look:\n\nThere are some variables that we can expect a positive or negative impact and other we don\u2019t know, such as temperature.\n\n(This is only expectations, we do not know yet what kind of result it will come!)\n\n    - Positive: \n    \n    - Markdowns: we expect that markdowns will affect positively. The only problem is that we have plenty of missing values. One way to tackle it is to replaced by dummy variables. We will lose the dimension of the impact, but at least we can maintain still measure the impact of these \u2018events\u2019. \n    - Isholiday: Sincerely, I do not know. But I guess that people have more time to spend their moneys in holiday. So, maybe I will expect a positive impact here. \n    \n    - Negative: \n    \n    - Fuel price: this variable represents the cost to move from one place to another. It can affect increase the price of the products (logistics) and also the cost of opportunity to consume. \n    Because, if it is more expensive to move to somewhere, then people stay more at home.\n    \n    - Both:\n    \n    - CPI (Consumer Price Index): well, this guy is tricky. CPI can help consumption, but also can affect negatively. \n    Why? Because CPI measures the average change in prices over time that consumers pay for a basket of goods and services. \n    So, in a very superficial explanation, an increase in CPI means the consumers need to pay more for the same services and goods, it will rest less money to consume other things. \n    The other point that we should consider is that CPI contain the prices of retail. I represent here the prices of the Walmart sales. We never should exclude this variable, because it is our proxy to Walmart prices. Ok, it is not the perfect variable, but this is life. We work with what we have. But what we will do with the missing variables (585)? Considering that CPI is a continuous variable with small variance in USA, we can apply just an interpolation.\n    \n    - Unemployment: as like as CPI, unemployment can affect two directions. \n    High unemployment, less consumption. Low unemployment, high consumption. As CPI case, we can apply an interpolation to deal with NA unemployment\u2019s data.        \n\nOow! I wrote a lot. But it is important to describe these variables, because this is the foundation of everthing. I promise that next steps I will be more syntetic.","67dcbb1f":"Hmmm, interesting. I was expecting a more obvious pattern of seasonality in weekly sales. But apparently there is only two seasonal peaks (holidays: thanksgiving\/back Friday and Christmas). At first look, if we do not consider these two peaks, the series is almost stable with a positive uptrend and average level around by 50 millions.\n\nAhn, ok, maybe other holidays can affect too, such as mother\u2019s day (May in the U.S.) and father\u2019s day (June in the U.S.), both not included in our variable \u2018IsHoliday\u2019. However, these other holidays seems to be marginal\/minor at a glance. \n\nOne thing that calls my attention in \u2018Resid\u2019 graph is the error in April. The \u2018deviations\u2019s errors\u2019 at the end of the year is because the thanksgiving\/Black Friday and Christmas. But why this cycle \u2018error\u2019 in April? Easter? Yeah, maybe. We should include a dummy to correct it.Let\u2019s analysed more the impact of these outliers (thanksgiving\/back Friday and Christmas) in our weekly sales.\n\nNow, I will back to analyse the panel data","7159aa8b":"# **Machine learning algorithm: XGboost**","3ef5d797":"# **Submission**","74034b1e":"# Pre-processing","b725afb4":"So, now we built a timeseries.
