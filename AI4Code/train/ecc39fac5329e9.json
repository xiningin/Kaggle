For those over age 60, the fatality rate jumps to 4.5 percent. The older the population, the higher the fatality rate. For those 80 and over, Covid-19 appears to have a 13.4 percent fatality rate.\n\nUnderlying conditions like diabetes and heart disease appear to be risk factors. Seventy-eight percent of all people put into intensive care for Covid-19 in the US have had an underlying condition like diabetes or heart disease: 32 percent had diabetes, 29 percent had heart disease, 21 percent had chronic lung disease, and 9 percent had compromised immune systems.  \nhttps:\/\/www.vox.com\/science-and-health\/2020\/4\/8\/21207269\/covid-19-coronavirus-risk-factors\n\nThe China Center for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s report of 44\u2009000 people with laboratory confirmed covid-19. Older age, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, hypertension, and cancer were all associated with an increased risk of death.2 A meta-analysis of eight studies including 46\u2009248 patients with laboratory confirmed covid-19 indicated that those with the most severe disease were more likely to have hypertension (odds ratio 2.36 (95% confidence interval 1.46 to 3.83)), respiratory disease (2.46 (1.76 to 3.44)), and cardiovascular disease (3.42 (1.88 to 6.22)).12. \n\nIn other studies, obesity and smoking were associated with increased risks.1011 In Italy, higher risks have also been reported in men than in women,13 which could be partly due to their higher smoking rates and subsequent comorbidities.\nhttps:\/\/www.bmj.com\/content\/368\/bmj.m1198"}}
