It's important to shuffle the indices before creating a validation set, because the training images are often ordered by the target labels i.e. images of 0s, followed by images of 1s, followed by images of 2s and so on. If we were to pick a 20% validation set simply by selecting the last 20% of the images, the validation set would only consist of images of 8s and 9s, whereas the training set would contain no images of 8s and 9s. This would make it impossible to train a good model using the training set, which also performs well on the validation set (and on real world data).","26cfa205":"The `.state_dict` method returns an `OrderedDict` containing all the weights and bias matrices mapped to the right attributes of the model.","9314cd65":"Note that we need to pass just the 28x28 matrix to `plt.imshow`, without a channel dimension.

One possible reason for this is that the learning rate might be too high. It's possible that the model's paramaters are \"bouncing\" around the optimal set of parameters that have the lowest loss. You can try reducing the learning rate and training for a few more epochs to see if it helps.\n\nThe more likely reason that **the model just isn't powerful enough**. If you remember our initial hypothesis, we have assumed that the output (in this case the class probabilities) is a **linear function** of the input (pixel intensities), obtained by perfoming a matrix multiplication with the weights matrix and adding the bias. This is a fairly weak assumption, as there may not actually exist a linear relationship between the pixel intensities in an image and the digit it represents. While it works reasonably well for a simple dataset like MNIST (getting us to 85% accuracy), we need more sophisticated models that can capture non-linear relationships between image pixels and labels for complex tasks like recognizing everyday objects, animals etc. ","c6d1e1b7":"Finally, we can determine the predicted label for each image by simply choosing the index of the element with the highest probability in each output row.

Here's a list of the topics we've covered:\n\n* Working with images in PyTorch (using the MNIST dataset)\n* Splitting a dataset into training, validation and test sets\n* Creating PyTorch models with custom logic by extending the `nn.Module` class\n* Interpreting model ouputs as probabilities using softmax, and picking predicted labels\n* Picking a good evaluation metric (accuracy) and loss function (cross entropy) for classification problems\n* Setting up a training loop that also evaluates the model using the validation set\n* Testing the model manually on randomly picked examples \n* Saving and loading model checkpoints to avoid retraining from scratch\n\nThere's a lot of scope to experiment here, and I encourage you to use the interactive nature of Jupyter to play around with the various parameters. Here are a few ideas:\n\n* Try making the validation set smaller or larger, and see how it affects the model.\n* Try changing the learning rate and see if you can achieve the same accuracy in fewer epochs.\n* Try changing the batch size. What happens if you use too high a batch size, or too low?\n* Modify the `fit` function to also track the overall loss and accuracy on the training set, and see how it compares with the validation loss\/accuracy. Can you explain why it's lower\/higher?\n* Train with a small subset of the data, and see if you can reach a similar level of accuracy.\n* Try building a model for a different dataset, such as the [CIFAR10 or CIFAR100 datasets](https:\/\/www.cs.toronto.edu\/~kriz\/cifar.html).\n\nHere are some references for further reading:\n* For a more mathematical treatment, see the popular [Machine Learning](https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/lecture\/machine-learning\/classification-wlPeP) course on Coursera. Most of the images used in this tutorial series have been taken from this course.\n* The training loop defined in this notebook was inspired from [FastAI development notebooks](https:\/\/github.com\/fastai\/fastai_docs\/blob\/master\/dev_nb\/001a_nn_basics.ipynb) which contain a wealth of other useful stuff if you can read and understand the code.\n* For a deep dive into softmax and cross entropy, see [this blog post on DeepNotes](https:\/\/deepnotes.io\/softmax-crossentropy).\n\n\nWith this we complete our discussion of logistic regression, and we're ready to move on to the next topic: *feedforward neural networks*!","ed1c45e8":"It's a pair, consisting of a 28x28 image and a label. The image is an object of the class `PIL.Image.Image`, which is a part of the Python imaging library [Pillow](https:\/\/pillow.readthedocs.io\/en\/stable\/). We can view the image within Jupyter using [`matplotlib`](https:\/\/matplotlib.org\/), the de-facto plotting and graphing library for data science in Python.","8cbeafcd":"For each of the 100 input images, we get 10 outputs, one for each class. As discussed earlier, we'd like these outputs to represent probabilities, but for that the elements of each output row must lie between 0 to 1 and add up to 1, which is clearly not the case here. \n\nTo convert the output rows into probabilities, we use the softmax function, which has the following formula:\n\n![softmax](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/EAh9jLN.png)\n\nFirst we replace each element `yi` in an output row by `e^yi`, which makes all the elements positive, and then we divide each element by the sum of all elements to ensure that they add up to 1. \n\nWhile it's easy to implement the softmax function (you should try it!), we'll use the implementation that's provided within PyTorch, because it works well with multidimensional tensors (a list of output rows in our case).","309305b0":"The `==` performs an element-wise comparison of two tensors with the same shape, and returns a tensor of the same shape, containing 0s for unequal elements, and 1s for equal elements. Passing the result to `torch.sum` returns the number of labels that were predicted correctly. Finally, we divide by the total number of images to get the accuracy. \n\nLet's calculate the accuracy of the current model, on the first batch of data. Obviously, we expect it to be pretty bad.","f633eaa2":"`img.unsqueeze` simply adds another dimension at the begining of the 1x28x28 tensor, making it a 1x1x28x28 tensor, which the model views as a batch containing a single image.\n\nLet's try it out with a few images.","ed4e1159":"The values range from 0 to 1, with 0 representing black, 1 white and the values in between different shades of grey. We can also plot the tensor as an image using `plt.imshow`.","e6c6f049":"It's evident that these images are quite small in size, and recognizing the digits can sometimes be hard even for the human eye. While it's useful to look at these images, there's just one problem here: PyTorch doesn't know how to work with images. We need to convert the images into tensors. We can do this by specifying a transform while creating our dataset.","41fce235":"Of course, this model is a lot larger than our previous model, in terms of the number of parameters. Let's take a look at the weights and biases.","235f4721":"If it's not immediately clear what this function does, try executing each statement in a separate cell, and look the results. We also need to redefine the `accuracy` to operate on an entire batch of outputs directly, so that we can use it as a metric in `fit`. ","e61fc609":"We expect this to be similar to the accuracy\/loss on the validation set. If not, we might need a better validation set that has similar data and distribution as the test set (which often comes from real world data).","11da6958":"We begin by importing `torch` and `torchvision`. `torchvision` contains some utilities for working with image data. It also contains helper classes to automatically download and import popular datasets like MNIST.","ab37f960":"Here's a sample image from the dataset.","922763ee":"Inside the `__init__` constructor method, we instantiate the weights and biases using `nn.Linear`. And inside the `forward` method, which is invoked when we pass a batch of inputs to the model, we flatten out the input tensor, and then pass it into `self.linear`.\n\n`xb.reshape(-1, 28*28)` indicates to PyTorch that we want a *view* of the `xb` tensor with two dimensions, where the length along the 2nd dimension is 28\\*28 (i.e. 784). One argument to `.reshape` can be set to `-1` (in this case the first dimension), to let PyTorch figure it out automatically based on the shape of the original tensor.\n\nNote that the model no longer has `.weight` and `.bias` attributes (as they are now inside the `.linear` attribute), but it does have a `.parameters` method which returns a list containing the weights and bias, and can be used by a PyTorch optimizer.","d882fd8a":"In this tutorial, we'll use our existing knowledge of PyTorch and linear regression to solve a very different kind of problem: *image classification*. We'll use the famous [*MNIST Handwritten Digits Database*](http:\/\/yann.lecun.com\/exdb\/mnist\/) as our training dataset. It consists of 28px by 28px grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 to 9), along with labels for each image indicating which digit it represents. Here are some sample images from the dataset:\n\n![mnist-sample](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/CAYnuo1.jpg)","07c500f8":"We have randomly shuffled the indices, and selected a small portion ( 20% ) to serve as the validation set. We can now create Pytorch data loaders for each of these using a `SubsetRandomSampler`, which samples elements randomly from a given list of indices, while greating batches of data.","b3b70f93":"While the accuracy does continue to increase as we train for more epochs, the improvements get smaller with every epoch. This is easier to see using a line graph.","5a5d01ea":"## Optimizer\n\nWe are going to use the `optim.SGD` optimizer to update the weights and biases during training, but with a higher learning rate of `1e-3`. ","23fd30c5":"Let's define a helper function `predict_image`, which returns the predicted label for a single image tensor.","97467d8d":"While we have been tracking the overall accuracy of a model so far, it's also a good idea to look at model's results on some sample images. Let's test out our model with some images from the predefined test dataset of 10000 images. We begin by recreating the test dataset with the `ToTensor` transform.","f621f8a0":"Although there are a total of 7850 parameters here, conceptually nothing has changed so far. Let's try and generate some outputs using our model. We'll take the first batch of 100 images from our dataset, and pass them into our model.","a31d7d74":"Since the cross entropy is the negative logarithm of the predicted probability of the correct label averaged over all training samples, one way to interpret the resulting number e.g. `2.23` is look at `e^-2.23` which is around `0.1` as the predicted probability of the correct label, on average. *Lower the loss, better the model.*","9a275de9":"## Commit and upload the notebook\n\nAs a final step, we can save and commit our work using the jovian library.","0433813e":"The initial accuracy is below 10%, which is what one might expect from a randomly intialized model (since it has a 1 in 10 chance of getting a label right by guessing randomly). Also note that we are using the `.format` method with the message string to print only the first four digits after the decimal point.\n\nWe can now define the `fit` function quite easily using `loss_batch` and `evaluate`.","fc29be59":"Jovian uploads the notebook to https:\/\/jvn.io, captures the Python environment and creates a sharable link for the notebook. You can use this link to share your work and let anyone reproduce it easily with the jovian clone command. Jovian also includes a powerful commenting interface, so you (and others) can discuss & comment on specific parts of your notebook.","25e1b48f":"# Image Classification using Logistic Regression in\u00c2\u00a0PyTorch\n\n#### Part 3 of \"PyTorch: Zero to\u00c2\u00a0GANs\"\n\n*This post is the third in a series of tutorials on building deep learning models with PyTorch, an open source neural networks library.

Our images are of the shape 1x28x28, but we need them to be vectors of size 784 i.e. we need to flatten them out. We'll use the `.reshape` method of a tensor, which will allow us to efficiently 'view' each image as a flat vector, without really chaging the underlying data.\n\nTo include this additional functionality within our model, we need to define a custom model, by extending the `nn.Module` class from PyTorch.","0fd0d31e":"While the accuracy is a great way for us (humans) to evaluate the model, it can't be used as a loss function for optimizing our model using gradient descent, for the following reasons:\n\n1. It's not a differentiable function. `torch.max` and `==` are both non-continuous and non-differentiable operations, so we can't use the accuracy for computing gradients w.r.t the weights and biases.\n\n2. It doesn't take into account the actual probabilities predicted by the model, so it can't provide sufficient feedback for incremental improvements. \n\nDue to these reasons, accuracy is a great **evaluation metric** for classification, but not a good loss function. A commonly used loss function for classification problems is the **cross entropy**, which has the following formula:\n\n![cross-entropy](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/VDRDl1D.png)\n\nWhile it looks complicated, it's actually quite simple:\n\n* For each output row, pick the predicted probability for the correct label. E.g. if the predicted probabilities for an image are `[0.1, 0.3, 0.2, ...]` and the correct label is `1`, we pick the corresponding element `0.3` and ignore the rest.\n\n* Then, take the [logarithm](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Logarithm) of the picked probability. If the probability is high i.e. close to 1, then its logarithm is a very small negative value, close to 0. And if the probability is low (close to 0), then the logarithm is a very large negative value. We also multiply the result by -1, which results is a large postive value of the loss for poor predictions.\n\n* Finally, take the average of the cross entropy across all the output rows to get the overall loss for a batch of data.\n\nUnlike accuracy, cross-entropy is a continuous and differentiable function that also provides good feedback for incremental improvements in the model (a slightly higher probability for the correct label leads to a lower loss). This makes it a good choice for the loss function. \n\nAs you might expect, PyTorch provides an efficient and tensor-friendly implementation of cross entropy as part of the `torch.nn.functional` package. Moreover, it also performs softmax internally, so we can directly pass in the outputs of the model without converting them into probabilities.","923faaaa":"The dataset has 60,000 images which can be used to train the model. There is also an additonal test set of 10,000 images which can be created by passing `train=False` to the `MNIST` class."}}
