We will also try to identify any unnormality that can cause noise in our model such as outliers and unbalance. We will look at continuous and categorical variables independently. Most important we want to find out any relation to the student exams. Here we make ssumption that pretest and posttest are happended under the same circumtances. We will use pretest as a target feautre to determine which features have correlation towards students test scores. \n\n- Histograms of categorical features \n- Boxplots of continuous features\n- Group bar graphs of pretest\n- Correlation Matrix","e7a46b9c":"The above graphs shows the correlation between each categorical features vs pretest. We can see from the Top 5 schools the schools name \"UKPGS\" has significant better pretest results than others, also school \"GOOBU\" has significant worst pretest results than others. This can make a assumption where differnt schools can result student to have different test results. From the school setting, we see \"suburban\" are covering more on the higher tests results and urban are covering more on the lower test results. We can also see similar results happened in school type and teaching method, but in the previous graphs we determine both features are biased. Therefore we can not assume the results and relationships. Interestingly we see different results coming from \"Lunch\". we can see students without lunch previlage tends to have better test results than students who do have lunch previlage. \n\n\nAssumptions:\n- Different Schools can have significant different test results.\n- School_setting in \"suburban\" will have higher test results and setting in \"urban\" will have lower test reults.\n- Gender will have euqal test results.\n- Students without free lunch will have a better test results and students with free lunch will have lower test results.\n\nNote: We can not determine weather school_type and teaching_method has a results in test results.\n","bbb7ba01":"## Objective\n- Predict test scores of students  \n\n## Key\n- Identify Relation between varialbes and target value.\n- Test differnt models to determine the best predictions. \n- Validate the model results with our assumptions.\n\n## Approach \n- Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis \n- State our Assumptions based on the Analysis\n- Pre-Porcessing the data for modeling \n- Compare results from differnt models \n- Validate and conclude our results\n\n## List of useful metadata\n\nCateglorical Variables \n - school : Name of the school the student is enrolled in\n - school_setting : The location of the school (Urban, Suburban)\n - school_type : School type (Public, Non-Public)\n - classroom: The type of classroom\n - Teaching_method : Teaching method (standard , experimental)\n - gender : the gender of the students (male,female)\n - lunch : whether a student qualifies for free\/subsidized lunch \n \nContinuous Variables\n - n_student : Number of students in the class \n - Student_id : A unique ID for each student\n - pretest : the pretest score of the students out of 100\n \n\nTarget\n - Posttest : the posttest score of the students out of 100\n\n\n","6fec39d9":"### EDA conclusion \n- There are no NaN values in the data.\n- There are certain outliers in \"pretest\" features\n- The data consists of more than twice the number of people in \"school_type\" of public and in \"teaching_method\" of Standard \n- There is no apparent linear correlation between continuous variable according to the heatmap.\n- There is no correlation suggedted on the scatterplot heatmap matrix \n- It is intuitive that scholl setting in suburban might have higher test results and school in urban might have lower test results.\n- It is intuitive that students without previlage to free lunch have higher test results and students with free lunch might have lower test results.\n- Student from a particular schools will have better results, it is hard to identify from the graph but we can see some colour dominate in some area indicating students are all performing in similar range. \n- There are no clear indication in correlation matrix and heat map. ","a339a4d9":"### Introduction \n\nThe competition in schools are growing everyday as technology advance and expectation increase. Students are expected to performe at their best with their knowledge, but often paretns and gardian will select spacific schools for their children to attend. This reason could include shool reputations , teaching methods , locations , etc. These factors are unrelated to student itself (personality\/IQ) but rather external effects. The goal of this analysis is to identify these external factors that can optentially effect students performance on the test resutls and if it does what can we predict base on these results.
