","9eceb5a6":"The highest parking violations are found under the category 'NO PARK\/STREET CLEAN'.\nThis means that people have parked their cars in the 'No parking' Area. \nBelow can be the reasons for that, \n1) The lack of parking spaces in the prime areas might account to the problem \n2) Few of them might also park their vehicles in the side of the road since the distance between their target location and the parking lot might be more and they had to walk to the destination after parking their vehicle.\n3) There are always a group of people who want to break laws by parking their vechicles in the 'No parking' area even when the parking spaces are nearby.\n\nThe 2nd highest violation is due to 'METER EXP'. \n\u201cExpired Meter\u201d is when the time on the toll-on-the-pole runs out before you exit the space. People aren't fined within 10 minutes of the ticket expiring. Since Los Angeles is a business place, many employees and customers park their vehicles. This is also an excellent tourist place and therefore attracts large number of visitors. The parking violation can happen because many of them might be stuck at work or being in some place and that caused the delay.\n\nThere are also occasions where the rules are violated by parking in red zone (where no parking is allowed except buses and cars who can stop to pickup\/drop the passengers). \n\nPreferrential parking violation is also one such type where the people have parked their vechicles in the residential area whose address  do not belong to two-block radius from the parking spot.","14204dbc":"California vehicle number plates tops the list with highest number of violations followed by Arizona (AZ), Texas (TX), Nevada (NV) and Florida (FL). This is reasonable since they are all neighbouring states to California. The counts of violations for the other states, however, is very low. This doesn't mean that tourists cause lesser violations. Many tourists nowadays rent a car to go out to visit places and therefore this chart doesn't give us information on which type of people are causing the violations."}}
