Removing them is a very big part in cleaning the text in the data. It is once again really simple to remove them using our tokenisation function earlier. <br>\n\nWhen we use token.is_stop, it returns True if the Token is a stop word else it is False. <br>\n\nThe following cell shows the stop words that are available in the model. More stopwords are available in bigger models.","cfdf26dc":"# Normalisation\n\nThis is something I personally use to clean up the text in the data. It is a really simple function that also includes our stop_word condition along with a few more conditions:\n\n* token.is_digit - Used to remove any digits\n* token.is_punct - Used to remove any punctuations\n* token.is_oov - Used to remove any words that are not present in the vocabulary","24df4113":"Here, 'md' stands for Medium. Other sizes are 'sm'(Small- Already present in Kaggle) and 'lg'(Large)","5ebcad6b":"## Stopwords Function","3ea2c07f":"So this cell just loads up the basic English model. Other codes include:\n\n* French (fr)\n* Chinese (zh)\n* German (de)\n\nAnd many more.
