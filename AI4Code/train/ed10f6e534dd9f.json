Remember that we split the dataset earlier to a training dataset (train_X, train_Y) and a testing dataset (val_X, val_y).","ee5a67ba":"Our goal in this notebook is not to predict, as accurately as possible, the price of bitcoin tomorrow. Instead we want to see how we can use a machine learning algorithm called Random Forest to create a model that can predict bitcoin prices using historical data on bitcoin supply and demand.\n\n\n### How Random Forest Works\n\nRandom Forest will make use of decision trees to understand how these factors affected bitcoin prices in the past. Simply put, a decision tree is a flowchart-like mapping of inputs and outputs.\n\n![](https:\/\/46gyn61z4i0t1u1pnq2bbk2e-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/what-is-a-decision-tree.png)\n\nThe patterns from these decision trees are what would dictate our price prediction model. The more data we can feed the Random Forest algorithm, the more opportunities it would have in finding new patterns and verifying existing patterns. It will then average the predictions of each tree to create a more reliable prediction. We will test how the predicted values fare out against the actual values. This means, we will save some data points from our dataset to test the predictions of the Random Forest algorithm.\n\nBefore we do that, let\u2019s first see what\u2019s in our dataset.\n\n### Quick Data Exploration\n\nOur dataset has 2,920 rows. These represent all the days between February 23, 2010 to May 19, 2017.","a3a9eda2":"### Yearly Growth Rates\nA quick look at the yearly growth rate of each factor, suggests their relationship to the bitcoin prices.\nFor example, when the number of bitcoin wallets increased by 150% in 2014 from 2013, prices recorded an almost 270% increase. On May 2012, the total bitcoins in the market increased by 45% from previous year. Meanwhile, the prices decreased of 30%. This follows elementary economics so far, an increase in demand drives up price while an increase in supply drives it down.","b719d26e":"Then we split the dataset into a training and testing or validation dataset. We need this so we can test how good our predictions are to the actual prices.","723aee96":"A seaborn scatter plot shows a more detailed view of how market prices have moved in relation to all the five factors over the years. We can see that most of the movements are concentrated on the green, purple and pink datapoints representing the years 2013, 2016 and 2017.\n","7ac65d6f":"* Total number of unique addresses used on the Bitcoin blockchain (btc_n_unique_addresses). This represents the number of bitcoin wallets that have been created over the years.\n","ae0e202d":"* Total value of all transaction fees paid to miners (btc_transaction_fees). When a person spends a bitcoin, that transaction will need to be verified by a set of computers owned by \u201cminers\u201d in the Bitcoin network. Transaction fees are required in order to have these transactions processed by miners. The spender may specify how much fee to add but miners can only confirm 1MB worth of transactions for each batch or block. If the number of transactions waiting to confirm exceeds what can fit in 1 block, a miner can choose to confirm the transactions with the highest bitcoin fees.\n","ec168567":"Below is a summary of the minimum, maximum and average values for each factor we're interested in, as well as their 25th, 50th and 75th percentile values.","6926e8ca":"#### We are specifically interested in the effects of these factors on bitcoin prices:\n\n* Total number of bitcoins that have already been mined (btc_total_bitcoins). \nThere are only 21 million bitcoins that can ever be mined.

This process takes a lot of computing powers and miners are rewarded with bitcoin payments for successful transactions (apart from transaction fees).\n","30bf9245":"We declare that we\u2019re using Random Forest to create a model:\n","b1dc91c3":"To see the predicted values of the model on the last 5 validation data, we can call:","a59b90b7":"*fin*","391e22b1":"## Applying Random Forest\nTo perform a Random Forest training on our dataset, we assign the X and y variables.

Meanwhile all the other factors \u2014difficulty to mine, coinbase block mining rewards, transaction fees and the increase number of bitcoin users proxied by n_unique_addresses share a positive relationship with btc_market_prices as expected.","cf8eece1":"We are specifically are interested to know how the following factors affect the average market price of bitcoin across major bitcoin exchanges (btc_market_price):\n1. Total number of bitcoins that have already been mined (btc_total_bitcoins)\n1. A relative measure of how difficult it is to find a new bitcoin block (btc_difficulty)\n1. Total number of unique addresses used on the Bitcoin blockchain (btc_n_unique_addresses) \n1. Total value of coinbase block rewards paid to miners (btc_rewards)\n\nWhen I was reading the data dictionary, I got confused about the difference between miners_revenue and transaction_fees. They sound overlapping:\n> - btcminersrevenue : Total value of coinbase block rewards and transaction fees paid to miners.\n> - btctransactionfees : The total value of all transaction fees paid to miners.\n\nIf I only want to get the coinbase block rewards paid to miners and assuming the miner\u2019s revenue includes transactions fees, I\u2019d have to create a new column by getting the difference between the two columns:\n\n"}}
