The neurologic consequences also vary extensively depending upon the size, type of hemorrhage and location ranging from headache to death. The role of the Radiologist is to detect the hemorrhage, characterize the hemorrhage subtype, its size and to determine if the hemorrhage might be jeopardizing critical areas of the brain that might require immediate surgery.\n\nWhile all acute (i.e. new) hemorrhages appear dense (i.e. white) on computed tomography (CT), the primary imaging features that help Radiologists determine the subtype of hemorrhage are the location, shape and proximity to other structures (see table).\n\nIntraparenchymal hemorrhage is blood that is located completely within the brain itself; intraventricular or subarachnoid hemorrhage is blood that has leaked into the spaces of the brain that normally contain cerebrospinal fluid (the ventricles or subarachnoid cisterns). Extra-axial hemorrhages are blood that collects in the tissue coverings that surround the brain (e.g. subdural or epidural subtypes). ee figure.) Patients may exhibit more than one type of cerebral hemorrhage, which c may appear on the same image. While small hemorrhages are less morbid than large hemorrhages typically, even a small hemorrhage can lead to death because it is an indicator of another type of serious abnormality (e.g. cerebral aneurysm). \n\n![Types](https:\/\/www.googleapis.com\/download\/storage\/v1\/b\/kaggle-user-content\/o\/inbox%2F603584%2F56162e47358efd77010336a373beb0d2%2Fsubtypes-of-hemorrhage.png?generation=1568657910458946&alt=media)","a91cc85f":"**We dont have information on patient's age, sex, etc. which could have been some helpful features.**","19badba9":"Patients go through six tests **(ID_63eb1e259_epidural, ID_63eb1e259_intraparenchymal, ID_63eb1e259_intraventricular, ID_63eb1e259_subarachnoid, ID_63eb1e259_subdural, ID_63eb1e259_any)** and the results are tabulated as boolean values.","87fc8971":"# What is DICOM?\n\nDicom is a format that has metadata, as well as Pixeldata attached to it.
