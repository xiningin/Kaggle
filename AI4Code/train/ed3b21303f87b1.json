the XIV Olympiad and commonly known as London 1948) was an international multi-sport event held from 29 July to 14 August 1948 in London, United Kingdom. Following a twelve-year hiatus caused by the outbreak of World War II, these were the first Summer Olympics held since the 1936 Games in Berlin. The 1940 Olympic Games had been scheduled for Tokyo and then for Helsinki, while the 1944 Olympic Games had been provisionally planned for London. This was the second time London had hosted the Olympic Games, having previously hosted them in 1908, forty years earlier. The Olympics would again return to London 64 years later in 2012, making London the first city to have hosted the games three times, and the only such city until Paris and Los Angeles host their third games in 2024 and 2028, respectively. The 1948 Olympic Games were also the first of two summer Games held under the IOC presidency of Sigfrid Edstr\u00f6m.\n\n![summer](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/thumb\/4\/47\/1948_Summer_Olympics_logos.svg\/266px-1948_Summer_Olympics_logos.svg.png)\n\nThe event came to be known as the Austerity Games because of the difficult economic climate and rationing imposed in the aftermath of World War II. No new venues were built for the games (with events taking place mainly at Wembley Stadium also known as Empire Stadium and the Empire Pool at Wembley Park), and athletes were housed in existing accommodation at the Wembley area instead of an Olympic Village, as were the 1936 Games and the subsequent 1952 Games in Helsinki. A record 59 nations were represented by 4,104 athletes, 3,714 men, and 390 women in 19 sport disciplines. \nGermany and Japan were not invited to participate in the games; the Soviet Union was invited but chose not to send any athletes, sending observers instead to prepare for the 1952 Olympics.\n","8c4acf7a":"<div style=\"background-color:#B4DBE9; color:#636363;\">\n    <h1><right>Summer Olympic Medals 1956<\/center><\/h1>\n<\/div>","c101c6a8":"<div style=\"background-color:#B4DBE9; color:#636363;\">\n    <h1><right>Summer Olympic Medals Spain-Barcelona - 1992<\/center><\/h1>\n<\/div>","c800f813":"The 2020 Summer Olympics (Japanese: 2020\u5e74\u590f\u5b63\u30aa\u30ea\u30f3\u30d4\u30c3\u30af, Hepburn: Nisen Nij\u016b-nen Kaki Orinpikku), officially the Games of the XXXII Olympiad (\u7b2c\u4e09\u5341\u4e8c\u56de\u30aa\u30ea\u30f3\u30d4\u30c3\u30af\u7af6\u6280\u5927\u4f1a, Dai Sanj\u016bni-kai Orinpikku Ky\u014dgi Taikai) and branded as Tokyo 2020 (\u6771\u4eac2020, T\u014dky\u014d N\u012b Zero N\u012b Zero), was an international multi-sport event held from 23 July to 8 August 2021 in Tokyo, Japan, with some preliminary events that began on 2\n\n![summer olympics](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/thumb\/1\/1d\/2020_Summer_Olympics_logo_new.svg\/230px-2020_Summer_Olympics_logo_new.svg.png)\n\nTokyo was selected as the host city during the 125th IOC Session in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on 7 September 2013. Originally scheduled to take place from 24 July to 9 August 2020, the event was postponed to 2021 in March 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the first such instance in the history of the Olympic Games (previous games had been cancelled but not rescheduled).However, the event retained the Tokyo 2020 name for marketing and branding purposes. It was largely held behind closed doors with no public spectators permitted due to the declaration of a state of emergency in the Greater Tokyo Area in response to the pandemic. The Summer Paralympics will be held between 24 August and 5 September 2021, 16 days after the completion of the Olympics.\n\nThe 2020 Games were the fourth Olympic Games to be held in Japan, following the Tokyo 1964 (Summer), Sapporo 1972 (Winter) and Nagano 1998 (Winter) games. Tokyo was the first city in Asia to hold the Summer Games twice. The 2020 Games were the second of three consecutive Olympics to be held in East Asia, following the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea and preceding the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, China.\n\nNew events were introduced in existing sports for 2020, including 3x3 basketball, freestyle BMX and mixed gender team events in a number of existing sports, as well as the return of madison cycling for men and an introduction of the same event for women. New IOC policies also allowed the host organizing committee to add new sports to the Olympic program for just one Games. The disciplines added by the Japanese Olympic Committee were baseball and softball, karate, sport climbing, surfing and skateboarding, the last four of which made their Olympic debuts.\n\nThe United States topped the medal count by both total golds (39) and total medals (113), with China finishing second by both respects (38 and 88). Host nation Japan finished third, setting a record for the most gold medals and total medals ever won by their delegation at an Olympic Games with 27 and 58. Great Britain finished fourth, with a total of 22 gold and 65 medals, becoming the first nation at the Summer Olympics to increase or equal their total medals won in the two Games subsequent to hosting them. The Russian delegation competing as the ROC finished fifth with 20 gold medals and third in the overall medal count, with 71 medals. Bermuda, the Philippines and Qatar won their first-ever Olympic gold medals.

These were the first Summer Olympics to take place under the International Olympic Committee (IOC) presidency of Thomas Bach.\n\nThe United States topped the medal table, winning the most gold medals (46) and the highest number of medals overall (121); the US team also won its 1,000th Summer Olympic gold medal overall. Great Britain finished second and became the first country in modern Olympic history to increase its tally of medals in the Olympiad immediately after being host nation.

The selection was made at the 20th IOC Session in Lausanne in 1921.\n\n\nThe opening ceremony was held on 5 July, but some competitions were already started from 4 May.

This is also the last Summer Olympics to be held in North America until 2028, when Los Angeles will host the games for the third time.\n\n![summer olympics](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/thumb\/4\/4e\/1996_Summer_Olympics_logo.svg\/197px-1996_Summer_Olympics_logo.svg.png)\n\nMore than 10,000 athletes from 197 National Olympic Committees competed in 26 sports, including the Olympic debuts of beach volleyball, mountain biking, and softball, as well as the new disciplines of lightweight rowing, women's fencing, a team rhythmic gymnastics event, and women's association football. A total of 24 countries made their Summer Olympic debuts in Atlanta, including 11 former Soviet republics participating for the first time as independent nations. With a total of 101 medals, the United States topped the medal table for the first time since 1984 (and for the first time since 1968 in a non-boycotted Summer Olympics), also winning the most gold (44) and silver (32) medals out of all the participating nations. Notable performances during the competition included those of: Andre Agassi, who became the first men's singles tennis player to combine an Olympic gold medal with a career Grand Slam (completed in 1999); Donovan Bailey, who set a new world record of 9.84 for the men's 100 metres; Lilia Podkopayeva, who became the second gymnast to win an individual event gold medal after winning the all-around title in the same Olympics, and the Magnificent Seven who dramatically won the first ever U.S. gold medal in the Women's artistic gymnastics team all-around.","d3fc9e5f":"The 1936 Summer Olympics (German: Olympische Sommerspiele 1936), officially known as the Games of the XI Olympiad (German: Spiele der XI. Olympiade) and commonly known as Berlin 1936, were an international multi-sport event held from 1 to 16 August 1936 in Berlin, Germany. Berlin won the bid to host the Games over Barcelona at the 29th IOC Session on 26 April 1931. \n\n![summer](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/d\/db\/1936_berlin_logo.jpg\/330px-1936_berlin_logo.jpg)\n\nThe 1936 Games marked the second and most recent time the International Olympic Committee gathered to vote in a city that was bidding to host those Games. Later rule modifications forbade cities hosting the bid vote from being awarded the games.\n\nTo outdo the 1932 Los Angeles Games, Reich Chancellor Adolf Hitler had a new 100,000-seat track and field stadium built, as well as six gymnasiums and other smaller arenas. The Games were the first to be televised, with radio broadcasts reaching 41 countries.\n\n","6707b333":"<div style=\"background-color:#B4DBE9; color:#636363;\">\n    <h1><right>Importing and Reading the dataset<\/center><\/h1>\n<\/div>","dd27fd3f":"<div style=\"background-color:#B4DBE9; color:#636363;\">\n    <h1><right>Summer Olympic Medals Canada-Montreal - 1976<\/center><\/h1>\n<\/div>","cf139c39":"<div style=\"background-color:#B4DBE9; color:#636363;\">\n    <h1><right>What is the worst appearance for Soviet Union in the Summer Olympics?<\/center><\/h1>\n<\/div>\n\n","e939ed3b":"<div style=\"background-color:#B4DBE9; color:#636363;\">\n    <h1><right>Summer Olympic Medals United States-Los Angeles - 1984<\/center><\/h1>\n<\/div>","836d3bc2":"<div style=\"background-color:#B4DBE9; color:#636363;\">\n    <h1><right>Summer Olympic Medals Soviet Union-Moscow - 1980<\/center><\/h1>\n<\/div>","d4c1ea98":"<div style=\"background-color:#B4DBE9; color:#636363;\">\n    <h1><right>Summer Olympic Medals Sweden-Stockholm - 1912<\/center><\/h1>\n<\/div>","6f50d062":"<div style=\"background-color:#B4DBE9; color:#636363;\">\n    <h1><right>Summer Olympic Medals United States-Atlanta - 1996<\/center><\/h1>\n<\/div>","d81c8e18":"The 1960 Summer Olympics (Italian: Giochi Olimpici estivi del 1960), officially known as the Games of the XVII Olympiad (Italian: Giochi della XVII Olimpiade) and commonly known as Rome 1960 (Italian: Roma 1960), were an international multi-sport event held from 25 August to 11 September 1960 in Rome, Italy. \n\n![summer](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/1\/11\/1960_Summer_Olympics_logo.png)\n\n\nRome had previously been awarded the administration of the 1908 Summer Olympics, but following the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 1906, the city had no choice but to decline and pass the honour to London.

They were also the only Summer Olympic Games to be held in a communist country until the 2008 Summer Olympics held in China. These were the final Olympic Games under the IOC Presidency of Michael Morris, 3rd Baron Killanin.\n\n![summer olympics](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/thumb\/c\/c1\/Emblem_of_the_1980_Summer_Olympics.svg\/180px-Emblem_of_the_1980_Summer_Olympics.svg.png)\n\nEighty nations were represented at the Moscow Games, the smallest number since 1956. Led by the United States, 66 countries boycotted the games entirely, because of the Soviet\u2013Afghan War. Several alternative events were held outside of the Soviet Union. Some athletes from some of the boycotting countries (not included in the list of 66 countries that boycotted the games entirely) participated in the games under the Olympic Flag. The Soviet Union later boycotted the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.

Melbourne is the most southerly city ever to host the Olympics. Due to the Southern Hemisphere's seasons being different from those in the Northern Hemisphere, the 1956 Games did not take place at the usual time of year, because of the need to hold the events during the warmer weather of the host's spring\/summer (which corresponds to the Northern Hemisphere's autumn\/winter). Australia did not host the Games again until 2000 in Sydney, New South Wales, and will host them again in 2032 in Brisbane, Queensland.\n\nThe Olympic equestrian events could not be held in Melbourne due to Australia's strict quarantine regulations, so they were held in Stockholm five months earlier. This was the second time the Olympics were not held entirely in one country, the first being the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, Belgium, with some events taking place in Ostend, Belgium and Amsterdam, Netherlands. Despite uncertainties and various complications encountered during the preparations, the 1956 Games went ahead in Melbourne as planned and turned out to be a success. The enduring tradition of national teams parading as one during the closing ceremony was started at these Olympics.\n\nEight teams boycotted the Games for various reasons. Four teams boycotted in response to the Suez Crisis where Egypt was invaded by Israel, France and the United Kingdom, three in response to the Soviet invasion of Hungary and one in response to the presence of the Republic of China at the Games.\n\nThe Soviet Union won the most gold and overall medals.","17ed136d":"The Summer Olympic Games, also known as the Games of the Olympiad, are a major international multi-sport event normally held once every four years.

In each Olympic event, gold medals are awarded for first place, silver medals are awarded for second place, and bronze medals are awarded for third place; this tradition began in 1904.\n\n![summer](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/5\/5c\/Olympic_rings_without_rims.svg\/270px-Olympic_rings_without_rims.svg.png)\n\nThe Olympics have increased in scope from a 42 competition event programme with fewer than 250 male competitors from 14 nations in 1896 to 306 events with 11,238 competitors (6,179 men, 5,059 women) from 206 nations in 2016.\n\nThe Games have been held four times in the United States (1904, 1932, 1984, and 1996), three times in Great Britain (1908, 1948, and 2012), twice each in Greece (1896 and 2004), France (1900 and 1924), Germany (1936 and 1972), Australia (1956 and 2000), and Japan (1964 and 2020) and once each in Sweden (1912), Belgium (1920), Netherlands (1928), Finland (1952), Italy (1960), Mexico (1968), Canada (1976), Soviet Union (1980), South Korea (1988), Spain (1992), China (2008), and Brazil (2016).\n\nThe 2024 Summer Olympics will be held in Paris, France for a third time, exactly one hundred years after the city's last Summer Olympics in 1924.

1908.\n\n![summer](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/d\/d7\/Olympic_games_1908_London.jpg\/330px-Olympic_games_1908_London.jpg)\n\n\nThe 1908 Games were originally scheduled to be held in Rome, but were relocated on financial grounds following the violent eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 1906, which claimed more than 100 lives. Rome eventually hosted the Games in 1960.\n\nThese were the fourth chronological modern Summer Olympics in keeping with the now-accepted four-year cycle as opposed to the alternate four-year cycle of the proposed Intercalated Games. The IOC president for these Games was Baron Pierre de Coubertin.\n\nLasting a total of 187 days (or six months and four days), these Games were the longest in modern Olympics history. The duration of the Summer Games was 16 days in 1912, ranged between 15 and 18 days from 1928 to 1992, and was fixed at 17 days from 1996.\n\n\n","9732328e":"<div style=\"background-color:#B4DBE9; color:#636363;\">\n    <h1><right>Inrtoduction<\/center><\/h1>\n<\/div>\n","cd135fdc":"<div style=\"background-color:#B4DBE9; color:#636363;\">\n    <h1><right>What is the worst appearance for Great Britain in the Summer Olympics?<\/center><\/h1>\n<\/div>\n\n","f2420072":"<div style=\"background-color:#B4DBE9; color:#636363;\">\n    <h1><right>Summer Olympic Medals Japan-Tokyo - 2020<\/center><\/h1>\n<\/div>","c1b93578":"<div style=\"background-color:#B4DBE9; color:#636363;\">\n    <h1><right>What is the worst appearance for France in the Summer Olympics?<\/center><\/h1>\n<\/div>\n\n","bf894d77":"The 1988 Summer Olympics (Korean: 1988\ub144 \ud558\uacc4 \uc62c\ub9bc\ud53d; RR: 1988nyeon Hagye Ollimpig), officially known as the Games of the XXIV Olympiad (Korean: \uc81c24\ud68c \uc62c\ub9bc\ud53d\uacbd\uae30\ub300\ud68c; RR: Je 24hoe Ollimpiggyeong-gidaehoe) and commonly known as Seoul 1988 (Korean: \uc11c\uc6b8 1988), was an international multi-sport event held from 17 September to 2 October 1988 in Seoul, South Korea. 159 nations were represented at the games by a total of 8,391 athletes (6,197 men and 2,194 women). 237 events were held and 27,221 volunteers helped to prepare the Olympics.\n\n![summer olympics](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/thumb\/d\/d6\/1988_Summer_Olympics_logo.svg\/225px-1988_Summer_Olympics_logo.svg.png)\n\n\nThe 1988 Seoul Olympics were the second summer Olympic Games held in Asia and the first time the Olympic Games were held in South Korea. As the host country, South Korea ranked fourth overall, winning 12 gold medals and 33 medals in the competition. 11,331 media (4,978 written press and 6,353 broadcasters) showed the Games all over the world. These were the last Olympic Games of the Cold War, as well as for the Soviet Union and East Germany, as both ceased to exist before the next Olympic Games in 1992. The Soviet Union utterly dominated the medal count, winning 55 gold and 132 total medals. The results that got closest to that medal haul are China's 48 gold medals in 2008 and USA's 121 total medals in 2016.\n","3e106724":"<div style=\"background-color:#B4DBE9; color:#636363;\">\n    <h1><right>Summer Olympic Medals Finland-Helsinki - 1952<\/center><\/h1>\n<\/div>","aaab00ba":"The 1976 Summer Olympics (French: Jeux olympiques d'\u00e9t\u00e9 de 1976), officially known as the Games of the XXI Olympiad (French: Jeux de la XXIe Olympiade) and commonly known as Montr\u00e9al 1976, were an international multi-sport event held from July 17 to August 1, 1976 in Montr\u00e9al, Quebec, Canada. Montreal was awarded the rights to the 1976 Games at the 69th IOC Session in Amsterdam on May 12, 1970, over the bids of Moscow and Los Angeles. It was the first and, so far, only Summer Olympic Games to be held in Canada. Toronto hosted the 1976 Summer Paralympics the same year as the Montreal Olympics, which still remains the only Summer Paralympics to be held in Canada. Calgary and Vancouver later hosted the Winter Olympic Games in 1988 and 2010, respectively.\n\n![summer olympics](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/thumb\/4\/4e\/1976_Summer_Olympics_logo.svg\/330px-1976_Summer_Olympics_logo.svg.png)\n\nTwenty-nine countries, mostly African, boycotted the Montreal Games when the International Olympic Committee (IOC) refused to ban New Zealand, after the New Zealand national rugby union team had toured South Africa earlier in 1976 in defiance of the United Nations' calls for a sporting embargo. The Soviet Union won the most gold and overall medals.\n\n","19afe7ed":"The 1912 Summer Olympics (Swedish: Olympiska sommarspelen 1912), officially known as the Games of the V Olympiad (Swedish: Den V olympiadens spel) and commonly known as Stockholm 1912, were an international multi-sport event held in Stockholm, Sweden, between 5 May and 22 July 1912.\n\n![summer](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/thumb\/b\/bd\/1912_Summer_Olympics_poster.jpg\/330px-1912_Summer_Olympics_poster.jpg)\n\n\nTwenty-eight nations and 2,408 competitors, including 48 women, competed in 102 events in 14 sports. With the exception of tennis (starting on 5 May) and football and shooting (both starting on 29 June), the games were held within a month with an official opening on 6 July. It was the last Olympics to issue solid gold medals and, with Japan's debut, the first time an Asian nation participated. Stockholm was the only bid for the games, and was selected in 1909.\n\nThe games were the first to have art competitions, women's diving, women's swimming, and the first to feature both the decathlon and the new pentathlon, both won by Jim Thorpe. Electric timing was introduced in athletics, while the host country disallowed boxing. Figure skating was rejected by the organizers because they wanted to promote the Nordic Games. United States won the most gold medals (25), while Sweden won the most medals overall (65). These were the final Olympic Games for 8 years due to the disruption of the First World War. The next Olympic Games were held in 1920 (the Summer in Antwerp).","fdbce171":"<div style=\"background-color:#B4DBE9; color:#636363;\">\n    <h1><right>Germany medals at the Summer Olympics<\/center><\/h1>\n<\/div>\n","2b573609":"<div style=\"background-color:#B4DBE9; color:#636363;\">\n    <h1><right>Summer Olympic Medals Netherlands-Amsterdam - 1928<\/center><\/h1>\n<\/div>","ecc378aa":"<div style=\"background-color:#B4DBE9; color:#636363;\">\n    <h1><right>What is the best appearance for Italy in the Summer Olympics?<\/center><\/h1>\n<\/div>\n\n","175312ef":"<div style=\"background-color:#B4DBE9; color:#636363;\">\n    <h1><right>Summer Olympic Medals Brazil-Rio de Janeiro - 2016<\/center><\/h1>\n<\/div>","1e4f7a4f":"<div style=\"background-color:#B4DBE9; color:#636363;\">\n    <h1><right>Summer Olympic Medals United States-Los Angeles - 1932<\/center><\/h1>\n<\/div>","f9f42253":"<div style=\"background-color:#B4DBE9; color:#636363;\">\n    <h1><right>Summer Olympic Medals South Korea-Seoul - 1988<\/center><\/h1>\n<\/div>","d2a7b2d5":"<div style=\"background-color:#B4DBE9; color:#636363;\">\n    <h1><right>Cleaning and managing the dataset<\/center><\/h1>\n<\/div>","6b699b86":"<div style=\"background-color:#B4DBE9; color:#636363;\">\n    <h1><right>Summer Olympic Medals Japan-Tokyo - 1964<\/center><\/h1>\n<\/div>","d817ba60":"The 1968 Summer Olympics (Spanish: Juegos Ol\u00edmpicos de Verano de 1968), officially known as the Games of the XIX Olympiad (Spanish: Juegos de la XIX Olimpiada) and commonly known as Mexico 1968 (Spanish: M\u00e9xico 1968), were an international multi-sport event held from 12 to 27 October 1968 in Mexico City, Mexico. These were the first Olympic Games to be staged in Latin America and the first to be staged in a Spanish-speaking country. They were also the first Games to use an all-weather (smooth) track for track and field events instead of the traditional cinder track. This was also the first example of the Olympics exclusively using electronic timekeeping equipment.\n\n![summer](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/c\/cc\/1968_Mexico_emblem.svg\/330px-1968_Mexico_emblem.svg.png)\n\nThe 1968 Games were the third to be held in the last quarter of the year, after the 1956 Games in Melbourne and the 1964 Games in Tokyo. The 1968 Mexican Student Movement was crushed days prior, hence the Games were correlated to the government's repression.\n\nThe United States won the most gold and overall medals for the last time until 1984.","e0ebd746":"<div style=\"background-color:#B4DBE9; color:#636363;\">\n    <h1><right>What is the worst appearance for United States in the Summer Olympics?<\/center><\/h1>\n<\/div>\n\n","9d0c13ef":"<div style=\"background-color:#B4DBE9; color:#636363;\">\n    <h1><right>Summer Olympic Medals Greece-Athens - 1896<\/center><\/h1>\n<\/div>"}}
