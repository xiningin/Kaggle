Southampton to New York City, was one of the deadliest peacetime maritime disasters in history, killing more than 1,500 people. The largest passenger liner in service at the time, Titanic had an estimated 2,224 people on board when she struck an iceberg in the North Atlantic. The ship had received six warnings of sea ice but was travelling at near maximum speed when the lookouts sighted the iceberg. Unable to turn quickly enough, the ship suffered a glancing blow that buckled the starboard (right) side and opened five of sixteen compartments to the sea. The disaster caused widespread outrage over the lack of lifeboats, lax regulations, and the unequal treatment of the three passenger classes during the evacuation. Inquiries recommended sweeping changes to maritime regulations, leading to the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (1914), which continues to govern maritime safety.**  \n*from Wikipedia*","ba708f0d":"**Embarked, Pclass and Sex :**\n\n** Practically all women of Pclass 2 that embarked in C and Q survived, also nearly all women of Pclass 1 survived. **\n\n** All men of Pclass 1 and 2 embarked in Q died, survival rate for men in Pclass 2 and 3 is always below 0.2 **\n\n** For the remaining men in Pclass 1 that embarked in S and Q, survival rate is approx. 0.4 **","7c136a9b":"**Sex: Female more likely to survive than male**","0bc44e6d":"**k fold cross_validation**\n\nThis algorithm splits the data into k sets and then makes k fits using every set k-1 times as training and one time as test data  \nIt leads to a better estimate for out of sample data  than simple train test split","53d9b9cd":"Also in df_test some values for Age and many values for Cabin are missing","59394309":"Women were more likely to survive than men \n\n74 % of women survived\nbut only 19% of men\n(in training set)\n\n-> second model :\nall women survived and all men died\n\nsubmission : 0.766 accuracy\n","4c1d0061":"\n## Part 2: Data wrangling\n\nbuilding two new dataframes df_train_ml and df_test_ml  \nthese will have only ordinal features and no missing values so they can be used for ML algorithms  \nconverting categorical to numerical by pd.get_dummies  \ndropping all features that seem to be not useful for prediction  \nThen use the Standard scaler and apply train\/test split","33770084":"**Train again for all data and submit**","a46669ed":"**Note on scores**\n\nSome kernels for the Titanic competition calculate scores based on the training set.
