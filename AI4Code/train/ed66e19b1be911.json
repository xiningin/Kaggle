We will try to create a model that will predict whether or not they will click on an ad based off the features of that user.\n\nThis data set contains the following features:\n\n    'Daily Time Spent on Site': consumer time on site in minutes\n    'Age': cutomer age in years\n    'Area Income': Avg. Income of geographical area of consumer\n    'Daily Internet Usage': Avg. minutes a day consumer is on the internet\n    'Ad Topic Line': Headline of the advertisement\n    'City': City of consumer\n    'Male': Whether or not consumer was male\n    'Country': Country of consumer\n    'Timestamp': Time at which consumer clicked on Ad or closed window\n    'Clicked on Ad': 0 or 1 indicated clicking on Ad\n\nImport Libraries\n\nImport a few libraries you think you'll need (Or just import them as you go along!)","26072b82":"## Get the Data\n**Read in the advertising.csv file and set it to a data frame called ad_data.**"}}
