Isn't it? :)**\n\n## What it is used for ?\nIt is basically used to compare whether a given, unknown sample comes from a known distribution or two unknown samples are from sthe ame distribution.\n\n## What is the idea behind it ?\n\nThe Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov statistic quantifies a distance between the empirical distribution function (EDF) of the sample and the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the reference distribution, or between the empirical distribution functions of two samples. We find the supremum, which means maximum valueof of the set of differences of EDF of the sample and CDF of ditribution. This is called the test-statistic or K-S statistic. It is denoted by D. If D converges to 0 then that means the sample follows the same distribution.\n\nAs we have already discussed, there are two scenarios of K-S test. The first one is when we are comparing a sample with given distribution. This is called one-sample case. The other one where we are comparing two unknown samples is called two-sample case.\n\nFrom Wikipedia: The two-sample K\u2013S test is one of the most useful and general nonparametric methods for comparing two samples, as it is sensitive to differences in both location and shape of the empirical cumulative distribution functions of the two samples.\n\n## p-value and K-S statistic\nThe null distribution of K-S statistic is calculated, under the null hypothesis that the sample is drawn from the reference distribution. \n\nIf p-value comes below the critical value (generally, 0.05), then we reject the null hypothesis. If p-value is less than the critical value, then it is good to say that sample is not taken from the distribution. \n\nLarger the value of K-S statistic, less  likely to be from the same distribution. \n\nK-S test does not work with small samples.\n\nLet's dive into the code to play with this concept.\n ","a87876ae":"The K-S statistic's value is very high and p-value is 0 only. OF course the given sample is of exponential distribution and we are comparing with Normal Distribution.","b67206e4":"The value of K-S statistic is very less and p-value is very high. So we accept the null hypothesis that the given sample is from the same distribution. We know the sample is taken from the normal distribution only.","d01143e3":"Python also supports, ks-test on two unknown samples and check whether they follow same distribution. \nLet's check it."}}
