This is a small dataset, so let us use $Repeated\\ Stratified\\ K\\ Fold\\ Cross\\ Validation$ for this.\n\nLet us understand what is Repeated Stratified K Fold Cross Validation:\n* **K Fold Cross Validation** - We take $k$ splits of the data, that is split data into $k$ equal parts. Take one part as validation set and other as training data. Then train model further by taking any other of the $k$ splits and the remaining part as training data.\n\n* **Stratified** - We will split the k folds in such a way that each part will have roughly equal number of classes.$$[Here,\\ each\\ split\\ must\\ have\\ roughly\\ equal\\ number\\ of\\ flowers\\ of\\ same\\ species]$$\n\n* **Repeated** - We will repeat this k fold splitting process a number of times.\n\nThis technique is to ensure we get maximum amount of training data for our model","a4baf48d":"### 3.

Naive Bayes Model\nNow we will make a `Naive Bayes` Model for predicting the flower type.\n\nNaive Bayes outputs probabilites for the data point to belong to each class. The class with the highest probability is taken to be the class of the flower.\n\nIt uses Bayes Theorem to calculate the probabilities for a flower having particular characteristics to belong to a class. When it sees new data, it uses its previous calculations to predict the class of new data.\n\nIt assumes that the features of the data are independent from one another.","72a97052":"## Get final Score\n\nWe also plot the cross validation scores using pyplot of matplotlib.","38301380":"# Iris Flower Classification using Machine Learning\n<hr>\n\n![Iris Flowers on unsplash](https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/Dutta-SD\/Images_Unsplash\/master\/Kaggle\/olga-mandel-gK6f8bKKic0-unsplash.jpg)\n\nIris Flower Dataset is a very useful datset. It is usually the first dataset that one usually comes across when starting on their ML journey.\n\nIt consists of dimensions of various flowers and we are required to predict what is the species of the flower.\n\nLet's explore this dataset and apply ML on it.\n\nSpecifically what we will be using : \n* **_Repeated Stratified K Fold Cross Validation_**\n* **Removing Feature interdependence using _PCA_**\n* **_Naive Bayes_ Model**\n* **Random Forest Model**","cdf8937d":"### Bar Plot Inference\n1.

This means that every cell of DataFrame has some value.

We have to use it to predict `species`.","bed590c7":"### PairPlot insights into the data\n1. `petal-length` and `petal-width` seem to be positively correlated(seem to be having a linear relationship). \n2.

Looking at the overall scenario, it seems to  be the case that Iris-Setosa has smaller dimensions than other flowers.","a69814ee":"### 1.

We can use it for:\n* **Outlier Detection** - See if any datapoint is very different from the others. If this happens, we need to remove it as otherwise it can skew our observations heavily. Visualising can help in this case\n\n\n* **Class Imbalance Detection** - Often in real world data, you can have observations from one class in a large number and other class in small numbers. This is problematic as if we have a dumb model that predicts the majority class all the time, it is going to get a good accuracy.<br><br>**If we have 99 'YES' and 1 'NO' in the dataset then the model predicting 'YES' all the time will get a 99% Accuracy.
