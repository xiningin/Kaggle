As the condition progresses, diabetic retinopathy symptoms may include:\n\n> Spots or dark strings floating in your vision (floaters)\n\n\nOver time, too much sugar in your blood can lead to the blockage of the tiny blood vessels that nourish the retina, cutting off its blood supply. As a result, the eye attempts to grow new blood vessels. But these new blood vessels don't develop properly and can leak easily.\n\nThere are two types of diabetic retinopathy:\n\nEarly diabetic retinopathy. In this more common form \u2014 called nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) \u2014 new blood vessels aren't growing (proliferating).\n\nWhen you have NPDR, the walls of the blood vessels in your retina weaken.\n> Tiny bulges (microaneurysms) protrude from the vessel walls of the smaller vessels, sometimes leaking fluid and blood into the retina. Larger retinal vessels can begin to dilate and become irregular in diameter, as well. \n\nNPDR can progress from mild to severe, as more blood vessels become blocked.\n\nNerve fibers in the retina may begin to swell. \n> Sometimes the central part of the retina (macula) begins to swell (macular edema), a condition that requires treatment.\n\nAdvanced diabetic retinopathy. Diabetic retinopathy can progress to this more severe type, known as proliferative diabetic retinopathy. \n> In this type, damaged blood vessels close off, causing the growth of new, abnormal blood vessels in the retina, and can leak into the clear, jelly-like substance that fills the center of your eye (vitreous).\n\nEventually, scar tissue stimulated by the growth of new blood vessels may cause the retina to detach from the back of your eye. If the new blood vessels interfere with the normal flow of fluid out of the eye, pressure may build up in the eyeball. This can damage the nerve that carries images from your eye to your brain (optic nerve), resulting in glaucoma.\n\nsource: https:\/\/www.mayoclinic.org\/diseases-conditions\/diabetic-retinopathy\/symptoms-causes\/syc-20371611\n\n![image.png](attachment:image.png)"}}
