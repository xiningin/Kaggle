Anomaly Localization](#AnomalyLocalization)\n\n### 1. Introduction\nMany Cyber-Physical Production System (CPPS) contain vital components that are subject to wear or deterioration. Usually, such parts come with an estimated life-time before they should be replaced, however, because of variable product complexity, different materials and workloads or different environmental conditions they can be quite inaccurate. Failure to replace a component in time either results in good parts being scrapped and unnecessary downtime due to repairs, or worse, breakdown of the production\/machine the scheduled replacement was too late.\n\nThis is why it is useful to monitor the condition of such components with the help of sensory information. In a complex system, especially when the machine itself is changed irregularly or utilizing changeable parts with slightly different specifications, the manual modelling of the weariness of some subsystem can be quite tedious (albeit very accurate and transparent if done correctly). In contrast, machine learning techniques offer a path to automatic model creation which can be relearned quickly if a system change necessitates it.\n\nIn this notebook we will follow the idea of [1] and learn the machine data of the new and functioning CPPS. Instead of a Self-organizing Map, the model that is used is a simple autoencoder that can be considered to be a powerful non-linear generalization of the classical PCA dimensionality reduction procedure.\n\nThe *new* data is going to be used for training and validation, while the model will be tested also on the worn component. The autoencoder reconstruction loss will be used as score function indicating the weariness of the component:\n\n$$L_n=\\left\\Vert x_n-f_\\theta\\circ g_\\theta (x_n)\\right\\Vert^2$$\n\nwhere $f_\\theta$ is the decoder, $g_\\theta$ is the encoder function and $\\theta$ are the model parameter that need to be optimized. $x_n$ is the $n^{th}$ datapoint which is a 7-dimensional vector and $\\Vert\\cdot\\Vert$ is the vector norm.\n\nWe will work within the tensorflow framework to define the autoencoder model as outlined below and start with a helper function to build the network and define the loss function.","e271f4ec":"### 4.
