It's an exciting field that will help you make use of vast amounts of data you didn't know how to work with before.\n\nThis course should be just your introduction. Try a project **[with text](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/datasets?tags=14104-text+data)**. You'll have fun with it, and your skills will continue growing.","c6ef1a60":"The result is a matrix of 100 rows and 300 columns. \n\nWhy 100 rows?\nBecause we have 1 row for each column.\n\nWhy 300 columns?\nThis is the same length as word vectors. See if you can figure out why document vectors have the same length as word vectors (some knowledge of linear algebra or vector math would be needed to figure this out).","f5672f32":"Go ahead and run the following cell to load in the rest of the document vectors.","1022f216":"# Document Similarity\n\nFor the same tea house review, find the most similar review in the dataset using cosine similarity.\n\n# 2) Centering the Vectors\n\nSometimes people center document vectors when calculating similarities. That is, they calculate the mean vector from all documents, and they subtract this from each individual document's vector. Why do you think this could help with similarity metrics?\n\nRun the following line after you've decided your answer.","e38ecb26":"Here's an example of loading some document vectors. \n\nCalculating 44,500 document vectors takes about 20 minutes, so we'll get only the first 100.

It runs pretty quick and works well in high dimensional settings like you have here.\n\nAfter running the LinearSVC model, you might try experimenting with other types of models to see whether it improves your results.","63152878":"---\n**[Natural Language Processing Home Page](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/learn\/natural-language-processing)**\n\n\n\n\n\n*Have questions or comments?

Then you can find the most similar review in the data set given some example text. It's a task where you can easily judge for yourself how well the embeddings work."}}
