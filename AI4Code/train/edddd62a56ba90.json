It seems even the simplest stacking approach really improve the score . This encourages us to go further and explore a less simple stacking approch.\n\n\n\n**Less simple Stacking : Adding a Meta-model**\n\n\n\nIn this approach, we add a meta-model on averaged base models and use the out-of-folds predictions of these base models to train our meta-model.\n\n\n**The procedure, for the training part, may be described as follows:**\n\n* Split the total training set into two disjoint sets (here train and .holdout )\n\n* Train several base models on the first part (train)\n\n* Test these base models on the second part (holdout)\n\n* Use the predictions from 3) (called out-of-folds predictions) as the inputs, and the correct responses (target variable) as the outputs to train a higher level learner called meta-model.\n\n\n\nThe first three steps are done iteratively . If we take for example a 5-fold stacking , we first split the training data into 5 folds. Then we will do 5 iterations. In each iteration, we train every base model on 4 folds and predict on the remaining fold (holdout fold).\n\n\n\nSo, we will be sure, after 5 iterations , that the entire data is used to get out-of-folds predictions that we will then use as new feature to train our meta-model in the step 4.\n\n\n\nFor the prediction part , We average the predictions of all base models on the test data and used them as meta-features on which, the final prediction is done with the meta-model.\n\n\n\nOn this gif, the base models are algorithms 0, 1, 2 and the meta-model is algorithm 3. The entire training dataset is A+B (target variable y known) that we can split into train part (A) and holdout part (B). And the test dataset is C.\n\nB1 (which is the prediction from the holdout part) is the new feature used to train the meta-model 3 and C1 (which is the prediction from the test dataset) is the meta-feature on which the final prediction is done.\n\n\n**Stacking averaged Models Class**","4e361a24":"Percent missing data by feature","379a21ac":"**Averaged base models score**\n\n\n\nWe just average four models here **ENet, GBoost, KRR and lasso**.
