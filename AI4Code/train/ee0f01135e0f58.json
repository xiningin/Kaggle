But one important caveat is the lack of observations for the extremes ranges in the sample, i.e. the observations of people with age < 40 seems to be low in comparison of the other age ranges.

","c1383fee":"# **Introduction**\n\nHi everyone!\n\nThe objective of this notebook is to test the Kaggle notebook features and play a little with python visualization tools (specially seaborn) and sklearn.\nI wanted to explore the variables for this \"famous\" dataset and build several models with sklearn API.\n\nAfter doing some basic exploration, some of the results and the insights didn't have any sense to me (I'm not an expert in the field, so I questioned myself a lot during this exercise); for example, exercise-induced angina (exang) showed that there is a **lower probability of having heart disease if the patient had exercise-induced angina**, which mas counterintuitive to the information I found. So after digging into the discussion tab over the dataset page, I found the [CORRECT](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/ronitf\/heart-disease-uci\/discussion\/105877) description; so I copied the correct information in the dataset description below and corrected some values after.  \n\nAny suggestions, feedback, comments are welcomed!\n\n## **Content**\n\n1.

The typical pipeline proposed to explore a dataset is always to start with the univariate analysis, then the bivariate and finish with the multivariate one. I prefer from my experience to perform the univariate along with the bivariate, and specific cases, use a third or even a fourth variable to dig into a multivariate one.\n    4.
