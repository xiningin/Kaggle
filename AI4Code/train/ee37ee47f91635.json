The extra potassium that your body does not need is removed from your blood by your kidneys. When you have kidney disease, your kidneys cannot remove extra potassium in the right way, and too much potassium can stay in your blood.\n*  From the above two scatter plots we can see that those people who are suffering from chronic kidney disease contain higher potassium since their kidney is unable to remove extra potassium, but we have also observed that people are still suffering through chronic disease even if they have normal range of potassium. \n* Even though serum_creatinine and blood_urea having slight positive relation not giving many insights about potassium.\n* We have 2 abnormal values as an outlier(39, 47)","95fd26e7":"* higher the specific_gravity lesser the chances of having CKD\n* from the above stats we clearly say that person having packed_cell_volume <40 and specific gravity <1.02 are all CKD patients.
