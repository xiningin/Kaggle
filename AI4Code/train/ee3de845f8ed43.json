The last bit to deal with is the impossible answer (when squad_v2 = True). The code above only keeps answers that are inside the context, we need to also grab the score for the impossible answer (which has start and end indices corresponding to the index of the CLS token). When one example gives several features, we have to predict the impossible answer when all the features give a high score to the impossible answer (since one feature could predict the impossible answer just because the answer isn't in the part of the context it has access too), which is why the score of the impossible answer for one example is the minimum of the scores for the impossible answer in each feature generated by the example.\n\nWe then predict the impossible answer when that score is greater than the score of the best non-impossible answer. All combined together, this gives us this post-processing function","5bfd2e65":"Run Fine tuning now","a8070ed9":"We will need a data collator that will batch our processed examples together, here the default one will work","478091af":"# Model Evaluation\n\nEvaluating our model will require a bit more work, as we will need to map the predictions of our model back to parts of the context.

This is done by a \ud83e\udd17 Transformers Tokenizer which will (as the name indicates) tokenize the inputs (including converting the tokens to their corresponding IDs in the pretrained vocabulary) and put it in a format the model expects, as well as generate the other inputs that model requires.\n\nTo do all of this, we instantiate our tokenizer with the AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained method, which will ensure:\n\nwe get a tokenizer that corresponds to the model architecture we want to use,\nwe download the vocabulary used when pretraining this specific checkpoint.","8aa7ec72":"# Setting Model Based Parameters","03974fc9":"# Fine Tuning the Model","d9489a3e":"We just need to pass all of this along with our datasets to the Trainer","80b3178a":"# Data Exploration","1b4d6da2":"# Install Module","48cb91d8":"The output of the model is a dict-like object that contains the loss (since we provided labels), the start and end logits.
