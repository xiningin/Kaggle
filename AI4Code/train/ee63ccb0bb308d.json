Orange color represents survived and Blue color represents Not Survived.\n\nTo make it easier, we have displayed the chart only in the diagnal pattern by using the parameter corner=True. You can check how the output appears by passing False value for this paramter.\n\nNow let us analyse this plot:\n\n* Row1, Col1: Top most histogram, very clearly shows that survival rate for the passenger travelled in 1st class is higher (Blue color bell curve is fully inside the Orange color bell curve) , For passengers travelled in Class 2 it is lesser (Blue color bell curve is slightly outer than orange color curve) and in Class 3 it is very less (blue color curve far higher than orange color curve).\n* Row2, Col1: Again it exhibits that survival rate for passengers travelled in class 3 is almost Nill regardless of # of siblings \/ spouses aboard the Titanic.\n* Row2, Col2: Survival rate for the passengers with # of siblings \/ spouses aboard the Titanic is zero and one, are relatively higher than other SibSp values. Especially when it is 1, number of surivived is higher than number of people not survived.\n* Row3, Col1 : For passengers travelled in Class 3, when # of parents \/ children aboard the Titanic is 1 or 3 then people surived and for other values they have not surivived. Surprisingly in PClass 1 also when Parch value is 4, people not survived.\n* Row3, Col2 : Combination of these two fields helps us to distinguish Survival vs Non Survival. Again we can observe that when # of parents \/ children aboard the Titanic is 4 and above then they have not survived. Might be that they would have tried surviving together and as members are more they would not have got accommodated in the lifeboat.\n* Row3, Col3 : When # of parents \/ children aboard the Titanic is 1 then survival rate is slightly higher than people not survived. When Parch is 2, both rates are almost same.\n* Row4, Col1 : Males travelled in first class surived, Females travelled in 1st and 2nd class had survived. Survival rate is low for third class passengers regardless of their gender.\n* Row4, Col2 : If the # of siblings \/ spouses aboard the Titanic is one for the male passenger then they had survived, If # of siblings \/ spouses aboard the Titanic is 0, 2 or 3 for the female passengers then they had survived,\n* Row4, Col3 : If # of parents \/ children aboard the Titanic is 1 for the male passenger then they had survived, # of parents \/ children aboard the Titanic is 0, 1 or 3 for the female passengers then they had survived,\n* Row4, Col4 : Survival rate for female is higher. Survival rate for male is bit low.","7aa3b53c":"In this code, we are going to discuss about how we can use one liner code to perform simple exploratory analysis.\n\nLet us do basic set up first.","595be57d":"Now let us use pairplot method from seaborn to visualize the data.  Before that we can convert gender as numeric (Male is 1 and Female is 0) so that it can be included in the plot.","99714606":"Let us read the training data."}}
