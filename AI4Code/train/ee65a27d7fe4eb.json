The main question to be answered with the data visualization is the following: What quantities of records were compromised by important data breaches, in organizations and sectors, between 2004 and 2018, and what was the reason? Let's find out!\n","108f1979":"## **2.- Data Dictionary**\n\nThe data set has 270 observations and 11 variables. The data set includes the following columns:\n\n* **Entity**. Name of the organization (public or private) that had the breach. \n* **Alternative Name**. Other known names of the entity.\n* **Story**. Summary of what happened.\n* **Year**. Year of the breach.\n* **Records Lost**. Number of records that the breach compromised.\n* **Sector**. Organization's main sector (or field of business).\n* **Method of Leak**. Main cause of the breach.\n* **1st source (link)**. 1st url with more info about the breach.\n* **2nd source (link)**. 2nd url with more info about the breach.\n* **3rd source (link)**. 3rd url with more info about the breach.\n* **Source name**. Name of the source of news, official reports, blog, etc. included.","5fe56976":"## **4.- Tableau dashboard**","cd687e0e":"## **3.- Data Visualization details**\n\nIn this section we are going to describe some elements of the visualization:\n\n* The records lost for each entity are represented by the bubble chart. The sizes of the bubbles are determined by the values of records lost. \n* We can filter the bubble chart by selecting a method of leak, year or sector.\n* If we rest the pointer over a mark in the view,  it will be highlighted in the rest of the dashboard.\n* If we rest the pointer over an entity in the bubble chart,  we can view some context information about the data breach.

I\u2019ve had a great time doing it and I have learned a lot, I didn't know that Tableau dashboards can be integrated in Python notebooks. Please upvote or comment if you like it.","41b4b41f":"# **Data Breaches Tableau Visualization**"}}
