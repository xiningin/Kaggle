This process is repeated for all combinations of hyperparameters in the grid.\n","c3437195":"### Performance Metric\nIt is difficult to measure the quality of a given model without quantifying its performance over training and testing. This is typically done using some type of performance metric, whether it is through calculating some type of error, the goodness of fit, or some other useful measurement. For this project, we will be calculating the [*coefficient of determination*](http:\/\/stattrek.com\/statistics\/dictionary.aspx?definition=coefficient_of_determination), R<sup>2<\/sup>, to quantify our model's performance. The coefficient of determination for a model is a useful statistic in regression analysis, as it often describes how \"good\" that model is at making predictions. \n\nThe values for R<sup>2<\/sup> range from 0 to 1, which captures the percentage of squared correlation between the predicted and actual values of the **target variable**. A model with an R<sup>2<\/sup> of 0 is no better than a model that always predicts the *mean* of the target variable, whereas a model with an R<sup>2<\/sup> of 1 perfectly predicts the target variable. Any value between 0 and 1 indicates what percentage of the target variable, using this model, can be explained by the **features**. _A model can be given a negative R<sup>2<\/sup> as well, which indicates that the model is **arbitrarily worse** than one that always predicts the mean of the target variable._\n\nThe code below is for the `performance_metric` by using  `r2_score` from `sklearn.metrics` to perform a performance calculation between `y_true` and `y_predict` and the the performance score will be assigned to the `score` variable.","af446868":"### Applicability\n\nI think this model doesn't fit with reality right now because it uses old data\nand not matching the recent changes such as infaltion and changes in the used features in that model and more as described below:-\n- since this model's data gathered in 1978,It is old and out of date and may be not suitable to figuare today's people trends. Also, I think Housing prices tend to rise with inflation and economic situations,it isn't really possible to predict inflation and we noted that these factors hadn't taken into consideration via this model. \n- The features used in this model may also changed by the time and didn't have the same impact as before,e.g.  'PTRATIO' feature may not be as important as before since people now have more means to reach schools more far and some schools afford buses to pickup students and so on.\n- New modern factors are come to control housing prices. Hence, prices nowadays depend on more diffrent features than the past ,we could mention some examples like provided services,traffic,welfare means and shoping places,square feet of the house ,quality of appliances,presence of swiming pools,.. and more.So I think these factors must taken into consideration as features within the model in order to give a good prediction as possible  i.e. need to have more features instead of three features it could grow up to 10 or more.\n- From the above results ,we found that for 10 different trials, the predictions are all different,changes from 351,577.61 to 424,935.00. The range in prices is 73,357.39.It seems that the prediction has large variation.I isn't robust system and doesn't give consistent results.\n- The collected  data from an urban citites such as Boston wouldn't  be suitable in another citity like one in rural cities,So it is not a veratile model and it is limited to certain domain in which data were collected.\n- Judging the price of an individual home based on the characteristics of the entire neighborhood is a common habit. And in most of common cases in real estate pricing we depend on the surrounding circumistances and conditions i.e the house price is highly affected by the neighbourhood houses' prices howerver this is unfair,expect in certain outlier cases in which the buyer is valuing the house for certain interest.\nI could conclude that this model must be revised and modified to accommodate up to date data and taking modern factors and changes into considerations.","1ed3d206":"### Training and Testing\n\n* The benefit to splitting a dataset into some ratio of training and testing subsets for a learning algorithm :\n\nBy thinking about how overfitting or underfitting is contingent upon how splits on data is done, we could conclude that for testing and validating our predictive model ,which means discovering if there's an error due to <b>bias<\/b> (<font color='red'> Underfitting<\/font>) or an error due to <b>variance <\/b>(<font color='red'>Overfitting<\/font>) and this will enable us to check for the generalization of the trained model(<b>Measuring Generalization<\/b>) i.e. observing the model performance on a data set which hasn't been seen by our model.In this case of model evaluation we will depend on true values for the unseen datain order to compare the model predictions and that is a great reason to split the overall dataset into two subsets ,one for training the model and the other for measuring model performance on unseen data (Testing), since if we had used the overal dataset for training we wouldn't be able to test it.But we should note that splitting the overall dataset into training and testing subsets doesn't always necessarily impact how well the training of the model is or how well it generalizes on unseen data and what we could say here that the main effective  facor may be how much relevant information is contained in the dataset and sometimes we need more data to get a better trained model (it doesn't depend on data split).\nwe also need to know that during splitting our overall dataset into to training dataset and testing dataset to fit our model on the training dataset in order to make predictions on the test dataset,it might be happen one of two thing: first either we may overfit our model i.e. the model finds <b>perfect pattern<\/b> over training data only but it fails on test data i.e. it <b> just memorized<\/b> it and fail for the newer ones(<b>can't be generalized well<\/b>).

A model trained on this data that is seen as a *good fit* could then be used to make certain predictions about a home \u2014 in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.\n\nThe dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https:\/\/archive.ics.uci.edu\/ml\/machine-learning-databases\/housing\/). The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:\n- 16 data points have an `'MEDV'` value of 50.0. These data points likely contain **missing or censored values** and have been removed.\n- 1 data point has an `'RM'` value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an **outlier** and has been removed.\n- The features `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, `'PTRATIO'`, and `'MEDV'` are essential. The remaining **non-relevant features** have been excluded.\n- The feature `'MEDV'` has been **multiplicatively scaled** to account for 35 years of market inflation.\n\nThe code below loads the Boston housing dataset, along with a few of the necessary Python libraries required for this project. <br>\n>**Note:** The dataset will be loaded successfully if the size of the dataset is reported.\n","edf9c3e7":"### Best-Guess Optimal Model\n\nIf we want to know which maximum depth will result in a model that best generalizes to unseen data and what intuition lead you to this, we should look at the graph above and see where the validation scores lie for the various depths that have been assigned to the model. Does it get better with increased depth? At what point do we get our best validation score without overcomplicating our model? remembering that, Occams Razor states \"Among competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected.\",.

To ensure that we are producing an optimized model, we will train the model using the grid search technique to optimize the `'max_depth'` parameter for the decision tree. The `'max_depth'` parameter can be thought of as how many questions the decision tree algorithm is allowed to ask about the data before making a prediction. Decision trees are part of a class of algorithms called *supervised learning algorithms*.\n\nIn addition, we will use `ShuffleSplit()` for an alternative form of cross-validation (see the `'cv_sets'` variable). While it is not the K-Fold cross-validation technique we described above, this type of cross-validation technique is just as useful!. The `ShuffleSplit()` implementation below will create 10 (`'n_splits'`) shuffled sets, and for each shuffle, 20% (`'test_size'`) of the data will be used as the *validation set*. \n\nFor the `fit_model` function in the code below, we will need to implement the following:\n- Use [`DecisionTreeRegressor`](http:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/generated\/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeRegressor.html) from `sklearn.tree` to create a decision tree regressor object.\n  - Assign this object to the `'regressor'` variable.\n- Create a dictionary for `'max_depth'` with the values from 1 to 10, and assign this to the `'params'` variable.\n- Use [`make_scorer`](http:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/generated\/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html) from `sklearn.metrics` to create a scoring function object.\n  - Pass the `performance_metric` function as a parameter to the object.\n  - Assign this scoring function to the `'scoring_fnc'` variable.\n- Use [`GridSearchCV`](http:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/0.17\/modules\/generated\/sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV.html) from `sklearn.grid_search` to create a grid search object.\n  - Pass the variables `'regressor'`, `'params'`, `'scoring_fnc'`, and `'cv_sets'` as parameters to the object. \n  - Assign the `GridSearchCV` object to the `'grid'` variable.\n  ","01bb725f":"-----\n\n## Evaluating Model Performance\nFinally, I will construct a model and make a prediction on the client's feature set using an optimized model from `fit_model`.","06c98c7e":"----\n\n## Analyzing Model Performance\nI'll take a look at several models' learning and testing performances on various subsets of training data.

Graphing the model's performance based on varying criteria can be beneficial in the analysis process, such as visualizing behavior that may not have been apparent from the results alone.","d773c69a":"### Sensitivity\nAn optimal model is not necessarily a robust model. Sometimes, a model is either too complex or too simple to sufficiently generalize to new data. Sometimes, a model could use a learning algorithm that is not appropriate for the structure of the data given. Other times, the data itself could be too noisy or contain too few samples to allow a model to adequately capture the target variable \u2014 i.e., the model is underfitted. \n\nThe code below shows the `fit_model` function ten times with different training and testing sets to see how the prediction for a specific client changes with respect to the data it's trained on.**","e5fe7959":"* The R2 score is the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable.

Then split the data into 80% training and 20% testing. And then set the `random_state` for `train_test_split` to a suitable value. This ensures results are consistent.
