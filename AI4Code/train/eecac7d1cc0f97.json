The authors therefore outline several key processes in ALS that might be impacted by a dysregulated glymphatic system.\"\n\n\"Whilst the cause of increased glutamate levels could result from several processes, the role of CSF in glutamate regulation could indicate a possible contribution in promoting potentially neurotoxic levels of glutamate in ALS.\"\n\n\"This could again be driven by the different aspects of ALS that affect CSF dynamics, including ageing, sleep disruption and vascular factors, amongst others. It should, however, be noted that CSF glutamate levels may not necessarily reflect extracellular levels, although increased CSF glutamate concentrations could likely affect exposed astrocytes.\"\n\n\"A further pathway already described by others is that spread of the disease (ALS) could occur via the CSF circulation. The presence of misfolded proteins, including TDP-43 and SOD1, has already been demonstrated in ALS-CSF, and, whilst neurons could potentially directly ingest these proteins through phagocytic mechanisms, another plausible mechanism previously suggested would be via uptake of exosomes containing the misfolded proteins.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/actaneurocomms.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s40478-020-01018-0","e74d1954":"<font color=\"#EC7063\">Cerebrospinal Fluid During Sleep<\/font>\n\n\"There are really large waves of CSF that appear in the brain only during sleep,\u201d  \u201cThis effect is really striking, and we\u2019re also interested in what it means for maintaining brain health.\"\n\n\"Disturbances in slow-wave sleep also often accompany aging, which may be linked to cognitive decline.\"\n\n\"It seems like things the brain is doing during sleep are related to each other in surprising ways.\"\nhttps:\/\/www.scientificamerican.com\/article\/deep-sleep-gives-your-brain-a-deep-clean1\/","f6c8a2aa":"<font color=\"#EC7063\">Cerebrospinal Fluid Velocity Wave Speed (VWS)<\/font>\n\nDOI: 10.1109\/TBME.2008.2011647\n\n\"CSF VWS was estimated by using the time shift identified by the maximum velocity and maximum temporal velocity gradient during the cardiac cycle.
