The resulting dataset will be viewed on scatterplot in 2D. It turns out to be overall rather featureless, but that's **exactly** what we would expect from the way that personality is understood - no clear clusters, and use of typology for personality is unwarranted. Nonetheless, we'll take a look at how geneder is distributed in the big persoanlity cluster. It turns out that a simple [logistic regression trained on the original item features can achieve AUC of 0.87.](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/tunguz\/16p-gender-with-logistic-regression). A simple look at the gender distribution on the tSNE plot will reveal *some* overall features, but nothing that jumps conclusively out.  "}}
