Through these \nsystems, users are able to easily rent a bike from a particular position and return back at \nanother position. Currently, there are about over 500 bike-sharing programs around the \nworld which is composed of over 500 thousand bicycles. Today, there exists great interest in \nthese systems due to their important role in traffic, environmental and health issues. Apart \nfrom interesting real-world applications of bike sharing systems, the characteristics of data \nbeing generated by these systems make them attractive for the research.\n\nThe goal here is to build an end-to-end regression task.\n\n\n","2773a2ea":"## Rental Bike Sharing Demand with Linear Regression\n"}}
