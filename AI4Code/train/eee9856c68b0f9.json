I guess after Wuhan quarantined, it is left its place to other reasons. As we know the virus is highly contagious, in cases occur every day we see that \"contact with patient\" is the one of the main reason why **covid-19** is spreading so quickly.

In this analysis, I tried to figure out to answer some questions such as ** \"which reasons are behind the infection?\" **, ** \"is there any correlation between treatment duration and age?\" **.","6e44d979":"Although the distribution for the female looks normal, there are 2 peaks at age 20 and age 50.

Gender doesn't show any meaningful difference.\n* The number of cases for women is more than men in the days which infection spread aggressively. However, the number of cases decreasing more for women more than men.\n* On average recovery time is around 10-12 days.\n* In the first days, coronavirus was spread by the patients who visit Wuhan.\n* Contact with the patient is the most important reason to spread the coronavirus.\n\n\nThank you!\n","6f782f4d":"After removing missing values there is only 666 patient left, what an interesting number...","4ac2f74a":"Since the distribution seems right skewed the mean is a little bit higher than the mode.
