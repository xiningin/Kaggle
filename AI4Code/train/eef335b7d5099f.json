","8af1149e":"Based on all of these insights, we built some datasets that will potentially improve our model performance:","98c6bb4a":"Somehow, all these (300) people were 30-59 days late 96\/98 times, 60-89 days late 96\/98 times, and 90+ days late 96\/98 times. This is really concerning.  However, the data might not be garbage, because (as expected) these people are defaulting at a massive rate (55%) compared to the population (6%). So we don't want to throw away this data. We can Winsorize by replacing all the 96\/98s with 20s to make them not extreme outliers and see if that improves the models. We don't expect that to improve the random forests, which are robust to outliers, but it might improve the SVMs.","74e39e03":"We will revisit these in the next section.","00e49ece":"...of those 185 entries, 164 of them have the same value for 2 year default rate and monthly income, indicating that there is a data-entry error. \n\nThe second problem is that despite owing thousands of times what they own, these people aren't defaulting any more than the general population. We can conclude that these entries must be data-entry errors, so we will remove them from our model.\n\nNow let's take a look at NumberOfTimes90DaysLate.","bb802dac":"Now that we have this tester up and running, let's go back to the datasets we created in our data exploration section. We can easily add them to the tester program to see how our models perform on them.","f17e4933":"## Neural Network","8bd41b1d":"These 241 people are not defaulting any more than anyone else, despite some of them owing hundreds of thousands of times their credit limits. These seem to be inconsistent with the rest of the data, so we can remove them from our model.\n\nFinally, let's take a look at using regression to fill in the missing values for MonthlyIncome:","c5734504":"# Model Testing","471255ae":"Random Forests seemed to be the best bet, so we decided to move forward with them and figure out the best tuning parameters. Running two for-loops allowed us to find the best value for max_depth and number of estimators, with our best model being the random forest with a depth of 9 and 16 estimators. When we use the data set that removes the RUUL outliers, it gives us an AUC of .8662. ","6ffd8866":"## Random Forests","f81acec4":"We noticed that the modified datasets have a big influence on the SVM AUC scores, but they don't affect the Random Forests as much. However, there's a noticeable gain in performance between simply dropping the missing values and the modified datasets accross all models. ","202ec04f":"Apparently 2.5% of the dataset owes more than 3,500 times what they own. We need to investigate further to see if these are outliers or not. We can see:","e922275b":"\"If you're over 55 and need a mortgage, the important thing to know if that lenders can't deny you a loan based on your age. But age can factor into your mortgage equation.\" ([Source](https:\/\/www.chicagotribune.com\/news\/ct-xpm-2005-11-20-0511200488-story.html))\n\nThis should be our first concern: making sure we're in legally okay territory. In order to solve this, we need to confirm that in our data set age has a negative influence on probability of defaulting. Then we can assume that the models we build reflect that trend, and won't deny someone a loan simply because they are old. ","e7b56dc7":"On the other end of the spectrum, we were also curious about trying out really fancy models, so we created and ran a neural network on the data. While K-Nearest-Neighbors was the weakest model we could think to run, a neural network was the strongest thing we could think to do. We expected its performance to be quite high, but discovered exactly the opposite. When initially training the network, we were excited to see it classifying 93% of examples correctly until we realized that it was guessing the same value every time. Essentially, the neural network was not learning a real decision boundary but was instead capitalizing on the imbalance on our data to achieve a high accuracy score. In order to combat this, we attempted to weight our classes differently, but unfortunately were unsuccessful. If we had wanted to, we could have pursued undersampling in order to balance the sample. However, we decided it would be best to not throw away large portions of our data. Because of this in combination with the fact that we do not fully understand the inner workings of a neural network, we decided to use a model whose theory we did understand and that enabled us to take advantage of all of the data.","b00a4ce7":"It is very concerning that someone owes 330,000 times what they own. Maybe that person is a single outlier? Let's take a look:","111f720a":"These 20,000 people are defaulting at a rate of almost 1-in-4. This is important! But what about people with more RUUL?

","c8b86db6":"## K-Nearest Neighbors","c0063cff":"We see two particularly concerning things here. The first is that of 4,000 records with DebtRatio > 3,500, only 185 of them have a value for monthly income.
