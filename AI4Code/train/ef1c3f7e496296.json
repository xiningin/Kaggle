We'll also record the learning rate used for each batch.","19fb328f":"## **Summary and Further Reading**\n\nHere's a summary of the different techniques used in this tutorial to improve our model performance and reduce the training time:\n\n- Data normalization: We normalized the image tensors by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of pixels across each channel. Normalizing the data prevents the pixel values from any one channel from disproportionately affecting the losses and gradients. [Learn more](https:\/\/medium.com\/@ml_kid\/what-is-transform-and-transform-normalize-lesson-4-neural-networks-in-pytorch-ca97842336bd)\n\n- Data augmentation: We applied random transformations while loading images from the training dataset. Specifically, we will pad each image by 4 pixels, and then take a random crop of size 32 x 32 pixels, and then flip the image horizontally with a 50% probability. [Learn more](https:\/\/www.analyticsvidhya.com\/blog\/2019\/12\/image-augmentation-deep-learning-pytorch\/)\n\n- Residual connections: One of the key changes to our CNN model was the addition of the resudial block, which adds the original input back to the output feature map obtained by passing the input through one or more convolutional layers. We used the ResNet9 architecture [Learn more](https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/residual-blocks-building-blocks-of-resnet-fd90ca15d6ec).\n\n- Batch normalization: After each convolutional layer, we added a batch normalization layer, which normalizes the outputs of the previous layer. This is somewhat similar to data normalization, except it's applied to the outputs of a layer, and the mean and standard deviation are learned parameters. [Learn more](https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/batch-normalization-and-dropout-in-neural-networks-explained-with-pytorch-47d7a8459bcd)\n\n- Learning rate scheduling: Instead of using a fixed learning rate, we will use a learning rate scheduler, which will change the learning rate after every batch of training. There are [many strategies](https:\/\/pytorch.org\/docs\/stable\/optim.html#how-to-adjust-learning-rate) for varying the learning rate during training, and we used the \"One Cycle Learning Rate Policy\". [Learn more](https:\/\/sgugger.github.io\/the-1cycle-policy.html)\n\n- Weight Decay: We added weight decay to the optimizer, yet another regularization technique which prevents the weights from becoming too large by adding an additional term to the loss function. [Learn more](https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/this-thing-called-weight-decay-a7cd4bcfccab)\n\n- Gradient clipping: We also added gradient clippint, which helps limit the values of gradients to a small range to prevent undesirable changes in model parameters due to large gradient values during training. [Learn more.](https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/what-is-gradient-clipping-b8e815cdfb48#63e0)\n\n- Adam optimizer: Instead of SGD (stochastic gradient descent), we used the Adam optimizer which uses techniques like momentum and adaptive learning rates for faster training. There are many other optimizers to choose froma and experiment with. [Learn more](https:\/\/ruder.io\/optimizing-gradient-descent\/index.html).\n\nAs an exercise, you should try applying each technique independently and see how much each one affects the performance and training time. As you try different experiments, you will start to cultivate the intuition for picking the right architectures, data augmentation & regularization techniques.","c4b98edb":"* ***User***: [@manishshah120](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/manishshah120)\n* ***LinkedIn***: https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/manishshah120\/\n* ***GitHub***: https:\/\/github.com\/ManishShah120\n* ***Twitter***: https:\/\/twitter.com\/ManishShah120\n\n> *This Notebook was created while undergoing a course \"[Deep Learning with PyTorch: Zero to GANs](https:\/\/jovian.ml\/forum\/t\/start-here-welcome-to-deep-learning-with-pytorch-zero-to-gans\/1622)\" from \"jovian.ml\" in collaboratoin with \"freecodecamp.org\"*","25f5f5b8":"The colors seem out of place because of the normalization.

Also, after each convolutional layer, we'll add a batch normalization layer, which normalizes the outputs of the previous layer.","d037ec69":"There are a few important changes we'll make while creating the PyTorch datasets:\n\n1. **Use test set for validation**: Instead of setting aside a fraction (e.g. 10%) of the data from the training set for validation, we'll simply use the test set as our validation set. This just gives a little more data to train with. In general, once you have picked the best model architecture & hypeparameters using a fixed validation set, it is a good idea to retrain the same model on the entire dataset just to give it a small final boost in performance.\n2. **Channel-wise data normalization**: We will normalize the image tensors by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation across each channel. As a result, the mean of the data across each channel is 0, and standard deviation is 1. Normalizing the data prevents the values from any one channel from disproportionately affecting the losses and gradients while training, simply by having a higher or wider range of values that others.\n3. **Randomized data augmentations**: We will apply randomly chosen transformations while loading images from the training dataset. Specifically, we will pad each image by 4 pixels, and then take a random crop of size 32 x 32 pixels, and then flip the image horizontally with a 50% probability. Since the transformation will be applied randomly and dynamically each time a particular image is loaded, the model sees slightly different images in each epoch of training, which allows it generalize better.\n\n![image](https:\/\/imgaug.readthedocs.io\/en\/latest\/_images\/cropandpad_percent.jpg)","215140d7":"### Preparing the Data","8ca79659":"### **Model with Residual Blocks and Batch Normalization**\n\nOne of the key changes to our CNN model this time is the addition of the resudial block, which adds the original input back to the output feature map obtained by passing the input through one or more convolutional layers.\n\n![images](https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/1140\/1*D0F3UitQ2l5Q0Ak-tjEdJg.png)","1d814fe5":"## **Imports**","bdacc5f5":"# **Classifying CIFAR10 images using a ResNet and Regularization techniques in PyTorch**\n\n### **Training an image classifier from scratch to over 90% accuracy in less than 5 minutes on a single GPU**\n\nPart 6 of \"PyTorch: Zero to GANs\"","ab71205e":"Here is a very simply Residual block:","e9634a3e":"We will use the ResNet9 architecture, as described in [this blog series](https:\/\/www.myrtle.ai\/2018\/09\/24\/how_to_train_your_resnet\/) :","9ac8fb32":"## **Training the model**\nBefore we train the model, we're going to make a bunch of small but important improvements to our fit function:\n\n- **Learning rate scheduling**: Instead of using a fixed learning rate, we will use a learning rate scheduler, which will change the learning rate after every batch of training. There are many strategies for varying the learning rate during training, and the one we'll use is called the \"**One Cycle Learning Rate Policy**\", which involves starting with a low learning rate, gradually increasing it batch-by-batch to a high learning rate for about 30% of epochs, then gradually decreasing it to a very low value for the remaining epochs.

This simple yet effective technique is called gradient clipping. Learn more: https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/what-is-gradient-clipping-b8e815cdfb48","b79a875a":"## **Data Loaders**"}}
