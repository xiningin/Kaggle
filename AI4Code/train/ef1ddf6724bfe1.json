You can do exploratory data analysis via df.describe() but that is a little bit basic. You can see each column the following statistics - if relevant for the column type - are presented in an interactive HTML report:\n\n- Essentials: type, unique values, missing values\n- Quantile statistics like minimum value, Q1, median, Q3, maximum, range, interquartile range\n- Descriptive statistics like mean, mode, standard deviation, sum, median absolute deviation, coefficient of variation, kurtosis, skewness\n- Most frequent values\n- Histogram\n -Correlations highlighting of highly correlated variables, Spearman and Pearson matrixes\n\nSee detail in https:\/\/github.com\/pandas-profiling\/pandas-profiling\n"}}
