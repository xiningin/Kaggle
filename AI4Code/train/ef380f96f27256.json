While the majority of us find this period as a time to recover and rest from studying hard throughout the year, there are a handful of students who wish to graduate earlier so they take part in Special Term School (Academic Calendar, n.d.) that takes place between early May to end July. Targeting NUS students who are between ages 18 to 25 years old, **Data Noobies** decides to study the open space study area in University Town's (UTown) Education Resource Centre **(ERC)**, which is also the building called **Loren**, standing on the **Wolf** plot of educational land. The other building taken in for comparison shall be the Stephen Riady Centre **(SRC)** which is then referenced to the building called **Josefa**.\n\nGuaranteed, the number of students during this period will be much less, hence the amount of electricity used for the building had to be heavily reduced to prevent unnecessary wastage, and this includes the light sensor settings in the toilet as well. Unfortunately, this reduction in light setting has caused inconveniences amongst the students using the toilets here as the lights would often go out before they are done with their business so the Facilities Management (FM) of ERC decided to engage **Data Noobies** to tackle this problem\n    \nIn order to determine the best duration of light sensor that needs to be used during this break, methods of forecasting based on hourly analysis as well as using an estimated value from the building adjacent will be crucial in determining the best estimate of toilet light duration to prevent students from facing an inconvenient situation when the night falls. \n  ","341f11e4":"This will be the overall water usage data of ERC's building however as you can see, the data is very packed and our group is unable to determine anything from here.","150fefe7":"***Water as an electrical energy indicator:***\n    \nWater is a good indicator of the amount of electrical energy used since the two elements are used concurrently by users. For example, the toilets generally require electricity to power up the lights, hand-dryers and even the fans installed in the toilet. \n    \nWater, on the other hand, is required by users for their toilet flushes as well as hand washing in the sinks, even in the usage of the bidet or spray. As such, the relationship between water usage and electrical consumption in toilets is of a direct relationship. When there is high water usage, it can be said that there are high levels of occupancy that require higher levels of electrical energy for the toilet sensor. \n    \n***Reasons for using Loren and Josefa:***\n    \nAs they share the same plot of land; **'Wolf'**, it can be assumed that the water system used is similar in nature. Both the **Loren** and **Josefa** education building shall be used in this context to provide a comparison of the experiment. \n    \nThrough this, the group will be better able to extrapolate the findings into predicting a better electricity usage to power the toilet lights long enough during the special term.\n\n***Analysis:***\n    \nIn order to make comparisons between both buildings, we will be utilizing the **monthly** and **daily** water usage. The scope of analysis will cover the range of dataset in the month of May to July and (hours). \n    \nTo further deepen our understanding of the occupancy ratio between the two buildings, we will look at the **description values** of water usage as a threshold. **Line graph diagrams** will also be used as a visualisation for the results we have extracted from the datasets.","0f9b677f":"Based on the two graphs and description information that the group managed to derive, it seems that it is still too vague to be telling of the trends from the months, hence the bottom part will be a narrow down to a specific week to allow the group to extrapolate the data for the water usage.\n\n\nDue to this, the below portion will be on the assumption that the week shall be:\n\n**16th May to 20th May 2017.**\n\nLastly, there will be a narrow down to a specific day and we decided to pick Monday as that is the fresh start to the week.\n\nDate: **16th May 2017**","9ce2e7c4":"<a id=\"section-three\"><\/a>\n# **3.

The mean and max of ERC is ~620% and ~440% higher than SRC, respectively. The standard deviation of ERC's data is ~440% higher than SRC, which would mean that ERC has a higher volatility in in water consumption. And there is no 0 consumption recorded in ERC's data, but there is in SRC, which could signify that ERC is never 'asleep'. \n\n***Similarity***\n\nFrom the data described above, both buildings uses a higher water usage in the daytime (especially between timings of 09:00 to 18:00). The hourly water consumption within the daytime fluctuated up and down in a range from 30 to 40%, where multiple peaks can be found from the data. \n\nThe water consumption in the remaining hours is relatively low and flows steadily, just like the one seen from part 6.1. Although ERC contains a higher overall water usage, both buildings share a fairly similar overall hourly water usage pattern, which allowed the group to compare both buildings for the water usage pattern.\n\n***About the Occupant Frequency***\n\nFrom these results, **Data Noobies** are able to tell that there is a higher toilet occupancy during the daytime in general for both buildings; hence a longer lighting time shall be allowed during such period. \n\nHowever, it is worth noting that there are difficulties in identifying the subtle water usage. The toilet occupancy during non-peak hours for ERC cannot be determined if the group looks only at the water usage data. Supplemental sampling or observations has to be done in order to allow **Data Noobies** to make better decisions. \n\n\n","e8f739da":"<a id=\"section-five-four\"><\/a>\n### **5.4.

On a larger scale, crucial systems like lighting installations not being properly configured is a recipe for disaster with potential problems including, but are not limited to, power cuts, loss of major resources and utilities, mass panic that might ensue from this etcetera. \n\nDeciding to start small, **Data Noobies** has decided to get to the bottom of the issue with the toilet lights, in hopes that our research and findings would be able to help UTown's FM to properly allocate resources for its students so as to ensure their safety and increase their quality of study.

Project Problem** ","b82b532a":"Based on the results that we got, energy that was used by the educational building called Loren, to which we used to refer for ERC, used a way bigger amount of energy in comparison to building Josefa for the SRC. \n \nFrom the statistics, it is clear that the peak periods are in the middle of the day according to the one week sample that we took. However, insufficient data about the water usage source makes it difficult to accurately point out the duration that should be estimated for the toilet sensors. There was also nulled data in between, which the group found out when we broke down the hourly meter of the water usage data in part 6.1. \n \n**Data Noobies** also realised that the water usage itself was volatile despite the use of adjacent building SRC (with the help of the Josefa building). Hence the conclusion that we could reach is that we needed a breakdown of the water usage source itself as it is clear that the usage is vague and does not specify the water usage was indeed from the toilets. \n \nOther potential sources of water may have come from washing the building, landscaping or even for the number of water coolers that are available in this educational building. The same can be said about the Josefa building used for SRC, which leaves us wondering if it could also come from the swimming pool or canteens operating in that building. \n \nNonetheless, the results that **Data Noobies** gathered is good enough to point out the trend and exact timing that the FMs of ERC should increase the duration. The next course of action for the FMs would definitely be to lengthen the duration and ensure that the peak timings are highlighted to prevent further inconveniences in the future.\n\nThe highlighted times can come in handy in a situation where a service reparation has to be done. By informing the servicing team about the peak timing allows them to not disrupt any water or electricity supply that may potentially affect fellow students or staff using the facility.\n \nMoving forward, further improvements could be having better accuracy of the water source. This would mean having more classifiers such as water source, usage type or even if it could be recycled water. Having additional data may be able to help **Data Noobies** come up with a much more comprehensive solution for our client(s). ","fc038129":"We propose to use the **monthly** and **hourly** meter data of water usage to help determine occupant frequency of the toilets in the ERC. After figuring out **occupant frequency**, we will attempt to uncover any **trends** observed regarding heavier or lighter usage of water at various times, and communicate our findings to the UTown facility managers so they may rectify the problem in the future. The result of our findings can be used to determine the right amount of electricity to be generated in order to better manage the energy usage in UTown.\n\nWhen we manage to source out the trend of high occupancy rates in the toilet, we can aim to expand the project beyond just toilet electricity, perhaps even the whole campus. Furthermore, the electrical energy usage can potentially help NUS Utown achieve Green Mark award as this will ensure that the electricity is at its most efficient. \n    \nWith the knowledge of having the occupancy frequency data, we will be able to adjust the time delay accordingly. For example, when there is a higher occupancy level during a specific time, we are able to store that duration\u2019s occupancy information and allow for a longer time delay so that the lights stay on and will be more energy efficient in the long run. The need to ensure we have accurate data would allow us to recognise which hour(s) of the day would require a longer time delay and vice-versa while also providing the students a comfortable and convenient experience.\n    \n    \nThe result of our findings can be used to determine the right amount of electricity to be generated in order to better manage the energy usage in UTown.

It is observed that during the first half of the week, the trend of water usage is displayed in a daily cycle which gradually decreases at the second half of the week. \nSRC however shows multiple fluctuations, with a constant upward trend for the first four days, and then a significant plunge on a Friday, albeit a lower overall water consumption.\n\nThe lower water consumption that could be observed at the end of the week may be because of lower occupancy. The end of the week is considered rest days, which explains why there are fewer students and staff in the building. \n\nHigher water consumption could be observed during the weekdays which may suggest a higher toilet occupancy. The team may ascribe it to the fact that lessons are usually conducted on the weekdays, so more students and staff will occupy the building during that period. High water consumption may also be attributed to other activities within the buildings by other occupants, such as cleaners cleaning the school areas. As a result, the water consumption will definitely be higher. \n\n***Similarity***\n\nBoth buildings are similar in signifying a fall in water usage on Friday. As Friday could be considered a rest day for most, there are less occupants in both buildings which suggests the fall in water usage. Note that there are missing values which appear as a gap in both graphs during the peak timing. Both graphs also depict a similar fluctuation cycle for the first few days (16-21 May 2017) \n\n***Occupant Frequency***\n\n*Monthly*\n\nAs seen from the diagram, there is a fluctuation in the amount of water usage, which is used to estimate the number of occupants in each buildings.\n\nIn the first two graphs, the lines show that the middle part of the day gets a high number of occupants, which can be assumed that lunch time of about 12pm to 2pm would naturally receive a lot of occupants utilising the washrooms.\n\n*Daily*\n\nHowever, as we zoomed in to the daily breakdown, **Data Noobies** realises that there are missing data between the timings of late 9am to early 12pm. This makes it difficult for the group to come to a final conclusion that the peak is only during 12-2pm.\n\nFurthermore, the result of both buildings slightly differ; ERC sees a dip in usage after noon however SRC sees a second high in the later part of the day at about 3pm.","18dffa50":"<a id=\"section-eight\"><\/a>\n#   **References** ","9d99e2e5":"Thus we have decided to expand the plot in order to try to find a trend in the amount of water used throughout the two years.
