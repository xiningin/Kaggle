girls arrested to the % of black girls in the general population** and the **% of black girls arrested**.\n\n**Target Variables**","fc3357ca":"Before I start the exploration, it would be good to know where data is missing.","fcf0837a":"*Black or African American Enrollment (%)*\n\nThe first piece of information that stood out to me was that there is a moderately weak relationship between the ratio of black girls arrested to their presence in the population and % of Black Students enrolled. This concerning trend suggests that in counties where black students are even more of a minority, black girls tend to be even more represented in arrest statistics. \n\n*Student-Staff Ratios*\n\nIt looks like the data might be telling us some contradictory information regarding student-to-staff ratios. Let's try to unpack that.\n\nUnlike % of Black Girls Arrested, the black student-to-staff ratios are negatively correlated with their overrepresentation. Another point worth noting is that these correlations here have a smaller absolute value than those observed for % of black girls arrested. Moreover, these two variables don't even appear to be correlated with one another (referring to the heatmap I would say they have a correlation of approx. 0.1), which is not what I was expecting. One possible explanation is that % of black girls in the general population is a stronger determinant to the ratio calculated. As population demographics is not something training or advocacy can influence, % of Black Girls Arrested might be a more worthwhile variable to track and study in order to fulfill DBWPC's mission. With this in mind, I would place more weight on the student-staff ratio correlations for % Black Girls arrested than that of the ratio of black girls arrested to their presence in the general population.\n\nThe negative correlation coefficients between the student-to-staff ratios and % of Black Girls arrested are so small there is arguably no relationship to try to discern. The only one worth nothing is that there is a negative, albeit weak, relationship between median teacher salary and black girls arrested. If we are assuming that most arrests occur at school, there is a possibility that underpaid and\/or inexperienced teachers might be more ready to call the police when a student is disruptive. At the county level, this is difficult to confirm but it might be worth doing a more granular analysis.\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nAs it has been found, there are cases in which counties have not reported staff data. Let's see if there are any observable trends in our target variables for these counties.\n","630de37c":"## Outliers?\n\nFrom the distribution graphs seen earlier, there are no outliers on the left side of the curve so the outlier analysis will be focused on identifying which counties are currently arresting the highest proportion of black girls. \n\nIn statistics, the standard cut-off value for finding outliers is Z-scores of +\/-3 or further from zero. However, given the mission of the DBWPC and the fact that an already unacceptable proportion of black girls are arrested and are overrepresented in an overwhelming number of counties, my cut-off value will be 2.\n","c54388ed":"I'm especially interested in the role of staff such as guidance counselors, social workers, librarians, and social workers - is there a correlation between the availability of them and trends in terms of arrests and overrepresentation of arrests?\n\nNext, I want to create features of the ratio of the total number of students enrolled and black students enrolled to these staffers.","a30eb2e9":"* Black girls are overrepresented in terms of arrest in ~90% of all counties in Florida.\n* While this is an alarming number, it has no correlation with the proportion of black girls arrested. Thus, the factor that most influences this ratio is arguably the % of Black Girls in the general population. This is something that can't be influenced by training, advocacy, or policy so % of Black Girls arrested might be a better target for the DBWPC to keep track of.\n* The moderately weak relationship (correlation coefficient ~-0.4) between the ratio between the ratio of black girls arrested to their presence in the population and % of Black Students enrolled, suggests that in counties where black students are even more of a minority, black girls tend to be even more represented in the arrest statistic ratio. The black girls in these counties (Franklin, Gilchrist, and Lafayette) may benefit from more advocacy by the DBWPC on their behalf.\n\n* The academic setting factors that appear to be correlated with % of Black Girls arrested are black students-to-instructional staff, black students-to-teachers employed, and black students-guidance counselors. One could hypothesis that the more support is available to black students from these groups, the less likely they are to get arrested.\n* Black students-to-school psychologist and % of Black Girls arrest has a correlations coefficient of ~0.6, which arguably means that addressing mental health leads to fewer black girls being arrested.\n* The counties with the highest proportion of black girls arrested are Hamilton and Madison; they might be a worthwhile place for the DBWPC should focus their efforts next.\n\nAgain, I want to note that a weakness of this EDA was that it was conducted on the county-level. That is to say even though a county had a higher number of certain staff employed relative to other counties with similar student populations, we don't know if the access to this staff is equal across all socioeconomic and ethnic groups. ","faea39b2":"## Create Features\n\nAlong with the % of juvenile arrests that were black girls, we are interested in the overrepresentation of black girls in terms of arrest so we should create a feature with this in focus. According to one of the DBWPC representatives, Vannessa, \"Because the counts for arrest will be higher, anything over 1.5 of the proportion of the general population in that county would be overrepresented.\"","ad01d025":"**Correlationships**","b042cfd3":"The distribution of the target variables for the counties with missing data are generally pretty scattered. Consequently, I don't think we need to worry that counties that did not report certain staff data were \"hiding\" anything.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nGiven the interest in the correlation between black students to staff ratio to our target variables, scatterplots indicating the visual relationship between the two will be generated.","8206a994":"So we have two cases where the ratio is equal to 0. This is because when the total counts of juvenile arrests were less than 10, the % of black girls arrests was not calculated in order to only provide meaningful results. Let's filter out these counties for our analysis as well.","0ede8c35":"For Black Girls Arrested\/Black in General Population, the % of children in poverty has the strongest positive correlation followed closely by % of everyone in poverty. Interestingly, factors related to not being in school such as dropout rates and absence have a positive, albeit a weak relationship with this ratio. This could suggest that even though many black girls get arrested at school, not attending school (either dropping out or being absent a lot) leads to worse outcomes.\n\nFor % of black girls arrested, the five strongest correlations are all black students to staff ratios. Black Students per instructional staff, black students per teacher, and black students per guidance counselor have especially strong positive relationships. These observations support the general idea that students tend to do better in academics when the student-to-teacher ratio is lower. In this case, a lower number of students to instructional staff and guidance counselors is also correlated with lower proportions of black girls arrested.\n\nOne thing to note is one major drawback of the data is that it is on a pretty high level. Even though a county could have a higher number of teachers employed compared relative to other counties with similar student populations, we can't be sure that the access to more teachers is equal across all socioeconomic and ethnic groups.","159191f9":"Unfortunately, black girls are overrepresented in terms of arrests in majority of counties in Florida. Moreover, as seen in both distribution graphs, there is a second \"peak\" in the right side of the curve meaning there are a number counties with high statistics for both target variables. Let's identify them in the outliar section.","94d2b72b":"This notebook is the result of my volunteer work for the DataDive Event hosted by DataKind that happened on 18 September 2021. I conduct data exploration to support the Delores Barr Weaver Policy Center's (DBWPC) mission of championing young women, especially those in the justice system, in Florida. \n\nDid you know that a lot of young black girls are pushed towards the juvenile system from a school setting and that black girls are overrepresented in terms of arrest in almost 90% of all counties in Florida?

I'll keep this in mind moving forward.","c90c8327":"Above is a heatmap of the correlations of all the socio-economic and school features I've collected or created. \n\nSome obvious relationships are highlighted such as the light beige boxes indicating that '% of All People in Poverty' is almost positively correlated with '% of Children in Poverty' The light orange boxes on the first row indicate that the proportion of black girls arrested have some strong positive correlations with a couple of the features. \n\nThe visual above gives us an overview of the various relationships in our data but let's zoom into our target variables.","056133b7":"## Preparing Data\n\nClean and Prep data to analyze the following data:\n* Arrest of Black Girls\n* All People in Poverty Index\n* Children in Poverty Index\n* Absence Data\n* Student Population Data\n* Teacher Salary Data\n* Drop out Rates\n* Staff Data"}}
