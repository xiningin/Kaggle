The sales growth had always been positive)\n\n* For the Store Kaggle Mart, positive growth has been seen always. However the sales growth of Kaggle Mugs in 2018 was less than year 2017. This implies that increase in % of Kaggle mugs sold from 2017 to 2018 was less than that seen in 2016-2017.\n\n* A similar pattern is seen with Kaggle Rama store where % increase in sales of Mugs & Stickers were more in 2016 to 2017 than 2017 to 2018.\n\nSo, for Finland for both the stores we observe that the sales growth % has increased over the span of 4 years. However the ratio of increase between years 2016-2017 was more than that of 2017-2018 for the following products:\n\n* Kaggle Mugs at Kaggle Mart Store\n* Kaggle Mugs and Stickers at Kaggle Rama Store","1a7cedc0":"The increase of Sales growth is great for Stores, but the decline is not. Some key observations that we have from the above graph is:\n\n1. For Finland growth of sales is positive between subsequent years.\n2. Norway saw a sharp fell in sales growth between years 2015-16 (-3.53%)\n3. A similar sales growth decline was seen in Sweden between years 2017-18\n\nFor the Analysis 1, we now have some light on the fact that because of Sweden's sales decline between 2017-18, the overall sales growth decline was observed.","e4a61dfa":"<h4> Observations <\/h4>\n\nNew Year & Christmas increases Sales of Kaggle Products. Across both the stores in Finland for all of the three products, growth in sales % ratio between two consecutive days increases sharply as Christmas and New Year Approaches.\n\n<h2> A Great Takeaway <\/h2>\n\nAfter the peak of Sales, a very sharp decline of sales for all of the products in all stores of Finland is seen (Note: Shops are open, because we have sales data for the goodies). Unavailability of Goods or partial closure of few stores, might be a potential cause for this trend. This might be the area where stock of goodies needs to be ramped up.","292a98e0":"<h3> Understanding the dataset <\/h3>\n\n* The dataset has 6 columns that store the details of sales of Kaggle Products by Stores in multiple countries.\n* 3 Countries - Finland, Norway and Sweden is present. There are 2 Stores, Kaggle Mart and Kaggle Rama\n* The stores sell 3 types of goodies - Kaggle Mug, Kaggle Hat and Kaggle Stickers\n* Sales data is recorded from January 01, 2015 to December 31, 2018 for all stores across 3 countries.  \n\nNow that we know what the dataset is, let's study the following questions using interactive Flourish charts:","9034461c":"### Tabular Playground Series - January 2022\n\n<h2> The Storytelling Behind Data - Using Flourish (Notebook 2) <\/h2>\n\n<h4> This Notebook is the the continuation of my previous notebook on Tabular Playground Series - January 2022.

I'll try to look through this dataset, do some EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) and try to build a story using beautiful yet impactful open-source visualization tool - Flourish. Flourish makes it easy to visualize data using easy approaches without need of code. Interactive data dashboarding to analytics storytelling, that's what I wish to explore in the Playground Jan 22' Series.  \n\nThis data doesn't simulates a real-world environment, but data storytelling is a fun thing to do. Let's now navigate to the charts and explore the dataset in much more depth. \n\nFrom the previous notebook, this time I would love to explore the sales on country & timeseries level. Hope you have a happy reading :)","d3014fdb":"<iframe src='https:\/\/flo.uri.sh\/visualisation\/8542094\/embed' title='Interactive or visual content' class='flourish-embed-iframe' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' style='width:100%;height:600px;' sandbox='allow-same-origin allow-forms allow-scripts allow-downloads allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation'><\/iframe>","28aeddcf":"<H4> Key Observations - Finland Kaggle Product Sales <\/H4>\n\n* The average sales % growth for both the stores across all the products are approximately same.\n* Sales of Kaggle Products are highest in Nov-Dec months.\n* Sales decline sharply between Jan-Feb for all the products.\n* Decline in sales is seen between May - Sep for Kaggle products\n\nAs a Kaggle Product seller in Finland special emphasis is required to me made between the months May - September as sales fell greatly during this tenure. December is the month of highest sales of Kaggle Goodies (can be related to Christmas or New Year) but the stores needs to attract the customers as a very high decline (-ve sales figures) are seen after the holiday period in February.","58fd3cd8":"<H3> The Thanks Note to Tabular Playground Series <\/H3>\n\nAnd Published. I'll possibly be doing comparable analysis for Norway & Sweden as well, when done. Would update the notebook ;)\n\nI always loved building stories out of data, and I loved very much writing these series of 2 notebooks to answer some basic questions with open source visualization tools. [Mar\u00edlia Prata](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/mpwolke) made me aware about the event, and with concluding the last notebook on this series, I would specially like to Thank you, for the great source of inspiration & support you had been to me.\n\nWould love to hear your opinions on this notebook.

Cheers!!","d1bf61c5":"<h3> How the dataset looks like? <\/h3>\n\nProblem Statement - There are two (fictitious) independent store chains selling Kaggle merchandise that want to become the official outlet for all things Kaggle. We've decided to see if the Kaggle community could help us figure out which of the store chains would have the best sales going forward.   \n\nWe import the data using python libraries and check them","6d9d97d6":"Year 2018 had the highest sales, but there are much more to know from the graph above -\n\n* Over span of 4 years, 16.63% increase in sales were seen (From 2015 to 2018)\n* Though 2018 reported the highest sales, but the % growth of sales between 2017-2018 was less than year 2016-2017\n* Year 2016-2017 had the highest growth increase in Kaggle Goodie Sales. Almost negligible growth was seen between 2015-2016\n\nOkay, so we now know the stores certainly needs to look to it's shops to understand why the growth of sales of goodies fell in the 2018 year.\n","a2fe1c35":"# Increasing Sales, but Ratio of Sales Growth between years decreasing?\n\n"}}
