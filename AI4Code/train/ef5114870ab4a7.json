For example, if they collectively bring home 91 candies, they'll take 30 each and smash 1.\n\n1. Create a variable called `numberOfCandies` that holds the total numbers of candies brought home by Alice, Bob and Carol (can be any number).\n\n\n2. Create a variable called `smashedCandies` calculates how many candies they need to smash (what is left over after they divide evenly?)\n\nHINT: Use one of python's numerical operators. \n\n3. Print the value of `smashedCandies` and the type of `smashedCandies`\n\nHINT: Use print() and type() function\n4. Convert `smashedCandies` to a string and print the type\n\n\n\n","75a05fe0":"# 2. Checking Types\n\nWe played around with printing and adding different python types together. Now we are going to focus on checking what type a variable is. In some cases you may not know the type of the data you recieve, and this is one way to find out. \n\nTo check the type of a variable or value in python we use the `type()` function\n\nLet's try an example!","62ee80be":"# 3. Casting Types\n\nWe played around with printing and adding different python types together. Now we are going to focus on changing the types of variables i.e. \"casting\" a string to be an int and vice versa. \n\nTo change or \"cast\" the type of a variable or value in python we will be using the `str()` , `int()` , or `float()` functions.\n\nLet's try an example!
