This is called **\"Data Leakage\"**. Its a fundamentally false parctice and should be avoided. You can learn more about it [here](https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/lecture\/python-machine-learning\/data-leakage-ois3n). In this notebook we will not talk about it. \n\nLets intuitionally try to understand the reasons for overfitting.\n\n### Being interactive\nLet's start by speeding things up. We will take a subset of our data to work with","286ef43b":"Ooops, you have error !!\nFirst thing, DON'T PANIC. Scroll to the very end of the error log and read the last line. It precisely tells you what the error is; **could not convert string to float: 'Low'**. It can not convert string to float, that means you will have to do it because all your Machine Learning model demand numbers(only) as input.\n\n### Categorical Features\n\nThis dataset contains a mix of **continuous** and **categorical** variables. We need to separate the categorical variables from continuous once and then encode(i.e convert) them into some numerical form. Simple ..huh??\n\n> **Lesson 1:** Don't be afraid of errors, instead LOVE them. Look at them as an opportunity to learn something, you don't already know.\n\nNow, we know the problem, the categorical variables are currently stored as strings, which is unamiable and inefficient, and doesn't provide the numeric coding required for a random forest. Therefore we need to convert strings to pandas categories. One can do it manually, I personally would prefer to write a python code which does it for me. There are several other advantages of writing a python code, for example it will work even if you have different dataset. Also, Imagine if you have 1000's of features, doing it manually would be a huge waste of time.","707d7cde":"> **Lesson 3**: For continuous variables, fill all the missing values with mean() of the column. Creating a new column specifying if data was missing is really a good practice and can help you to achieve better scores.","ed96a070":"The training set result looks great! But the validation set is worse than our original model. This is why we need to use bagging of multiple trees to get more generalizable results.\n\n## Bagging\n### Introduction","41ff9042":"In statistics, the coefficient of determination, denoted R2 or r2 and pronounced \"R squared\", is the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s). [https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Coefficient_of_determination](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Coefficient_of_determination)\n\nWow, an r^2 of 0.98 - that's great, right? Well, perhaps not...\n\nPossibly the most important idea in machine learning is that of having separate training & validation data sets. As motivation, suppose you don't divide up your data, but instead use all of it. And suppose you have lots of parameters:\n\n![Underfitting and Overfitting](https:\/\/i.stack.imgur.com\/t0zit.png)\n[Refer this link](https:\/\/datascience.stackexchange.com\/questions\/361\/when-is-a-model-underfitted)\n\nThe error for the pictured data points is lowest for the model on the far right (the blue curve passes through the red points almost perfectly), yet it's not the best choice. Why is that? If you were to gather some new data points, they most likely would not be on that curve in the graph on the right, but would be closer to the curve in the middle graph.\n\nThis illustrates how using all our data can lead to overfitting. A validation set helps diagnose this problem.","4cd7caa8":"### Putting it all together\nWe are almost done with the preprocessing part. We have taken care of Missing values, time stamp and categorical variables. These are the most common problems that we come across in almost every dataset.

The function would look like:**","2bf0a5f7":"### Single tree","1d167909":"We'll grab the predictions for each individual tree, and look at one example.","1d3dfecc":"Let's see what happens if we create a bigger tree.","511590dc":"### Missing values\nWe're still not quite done - for instance we have lots of missing values, which we can't pass directly to a random forest. ","fd501872":"Oops, Another error !!\n\nFirst thing, DON'T PANIC. Read the last line, it says \"timestamp\" is not supported. We will have to convert the \"timestamp\" variable into some numerical format. There are two possible ways of handling this situation.\n- You can delete the timestamp column (i.e. saledate) completely. OR\n- You can do some feature engineering on that column (our approach).\n\n### Time Stamp\n\nWe will extract particular date fields from a complete datetime for the purpose of constructing categoricals. You should always consider this feature extraction step when working with date-time. Without expanding your date-time into these additional fields, you can't capture any trend\/cyclical behavior as a function of time at any of these granularities.\n\n> **Lesson 2:** Always use \"add_datepart\" or similar method for feature extraction when working with date-time.","5110fe45":"In any sort of data science work, **it's important to look at your data**, to make sure you understand the format, how it's stored, what type of values it holds, etc. Even if you've read descriptions about your data, the actual data may not be what you expect. So, lets start by look at out data.","bbd1627f":"### Intializing the model\nOnce you have your dataset and metric in place, first thing you should always do is try training a model (here Random Forest, with default parameters) on your data.","db7223ed":"There's a huge difference between validation_score and oob_score. In this scenario, your model is performing better on oob_set, which is take directly from your training dataset. Indicating, validation_set is for a different time period. (say training_set has records for the month of \"January\" and validation_set has records for the month of \"July\"). So, more than a test for model's performance, oob_score is test for \"how representative is your Validation_set\".\n\nYou should always make sure that you have a good representative validation_set, because it's score is used as an indicator for our model's performance. So your goal should be, to have as little difference between oob_score and valid_score as possible.\n\nThe **huge difference between Train_score and valid_score**,  is an indicator that our model is over-fitting very badly.\n\n## Fighting Over fitting\n### Using tree parameters\nWe will use the last trained random forest as a baseline model to which all the other models will be compared.","f10349ec":"As guessed, icreasing the number of estimators after a certain number will not help. A good range to look for is between 20-40 estimators.\n\n### Out-of-bag (OOB) score\n**Is our validation set worse than our training set because we're over-fitting, or because the validation set is for a different time period, or a bit of both?** The questions are really subtle so read them twice before you move ahead. With the existing information we've shown, we can't tell. However, random forests have a very clever trick called out-of-bag (OOB) error which can handle this (and more!)\n\nThe idea is to calculate error on the training set, but only include the trees in the calculation of a row's error where that row was not included in training that tree. This allows us to see whether the model is over-fitting, without needing a separate validation set.\n\nThis also has the benefit of allowing us to see whether our model generalizes, even if we only have a small amount of data so want to avoid separating some out to create a validation set.\n\nThis is as simple as adding one more parameter to our model constructor. We print the OOB error last in our print_score function below.\n","93a23aae":"Normally, pandas will continue displaying the text categories, while treating them as numerical data internally.

One easy and intuitional way is to fill all the missing values with  the column's mean value.","05945371":"#### 1. *min_samples_leaf*\nOne way to reduce over-fitting is to grow our trees less deeply. We do this by specifying (with *min_samples_leaf*) that we require some minimum number of rows in every leaf node. This has two benefits:    \n- There are less decision rules for each leaf node; simpler models should generalize better.\n- The predictions are made by averaging more rows in the leaf node, resulting in less volatility.\n\n#### 2. *max_features*\nWe can also increase the amount of variation amongst the trees by using a different sample of columns for each split. We do this by specifying *max_features*, which is the proportion of features to randomly select from at each split.\n\n"}}
