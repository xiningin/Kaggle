Depending on the cause, the air may be replaced with:\n\n - a fluid, such as pus, blood, or water\n - a solid, such as stomach contents or cells\n \nThe appearance of your lungs on a chest X-ray, and your symptoms, are similar for all these substances. So, you\u2019ll typically need more tests to find out why your lungs are consolidated. With appropriate treatment, the consolidation usually goes away and air returns.\n","b21071e2":"## 1.

When you breathe, air moves from the main airway in your throat, sometimes called your windpipe, to your lungs. The airways continue branching and get progressively smaller until they end in little sacs called alveoli.\n\nYour alveoli help to exchange the oxygen in the air for carbon dioxide, a waste product from your tissues and organs. In order to do this, your alveoli must fill with air.\n\nWhen some of your alveoli don\u2019t fill with air, it\u2019s called \u201catelectasis.\u201d\n\nDepending on the underlying cause, atelectasis can involve either small or large portions of your lung.","e75a278b":"## 3.

As such, it is more commonly referred to simply as \"having an enlarged heart\".\n\nCardiomegaly is not a disease, but rather a condition that can result from a host of other diseases such as obesity or coronary artery disease. Cardiomegaly can be serious: depending on what part of the heart is enlarged, the patient can suffer from heart failure.

The three types of aneurysm are Ascending Thoracic aortic Aneurysm (TAA), Descending Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm (TAA), and Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA). The Fusiform Aneurysm and Saccular Aneurysm show the two types of aneurysm shapes.\n\nThe aorta is your largest artery and it brings oxygenated blood to all parts of the body. If the walls of the aorta become weak, an enlargement can occur, which is known as an aortic aneurysm. Aneurysms can form in any section of the aorta, but are most common in the abdomen (abdominal aortic aneurysm) or the upper body (thoracic aortic aneurysm). \n  \n(Please compare the below images to the normal images.)","c8329b74":"## 6.

The interstitium is the tiny, fluid-filled tissue and space around the air sacs in the lungs.\n\nIn healthy people, the interstitium is very thin. In interstitial lung diseases, the interstitium thickens and scars. Over time, the scarring can cause lung stiffness and eventually affect breathing.\n\nPeople with interstitial lung disease find it hard to get enough oxygen into their bloodstream. If you have an interstitial lung disease, other compartments of your lungs can also be affected, including:\n\n - Alveoli\n - Airways (trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles)\n - Blood vessels\n - Pleura (outside lining of the lung).","135ecd01":"## 11.

As pulmonary fibrosis worsens, you become progressively more short of breath.","92174e08":"\n---\n\n\n## The Dataset\n\n[[ go back to the top ]](#Table-of-contents)\n\nIn this competition, we are classifying common thoracic lung diseases and localizing critical findings. This is an object detection and classification problem.\n\nFor each test image, you will be predicting a bounding box and class for all findings. If you predict that there are no findings, you should create a prediction of **`14 1 0 0 1 1`** *(14 is the class ID for no finding, and this provides a one-pixel bounding box with a confidence of 1.0)*\n\nNote that the images are in **DICOM** format, which means they contain additional data that might be useful for visualizing and classifying.\n\n\n\n![Example Radiographs](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/QWmbhXx.png)\n\n<br>\n\n#### DATASET INFORMATION\n\nThe dataset comprises **`18,000`** postero-anterior (PA) CXR scans in DICOM format, which were de-identified to protect patient privacy. \n\nAll images were labeled by a panel of experienced radiologists for the presence of **14** critical radiographic findings as listed below:\n\n- [0. Aortic enlargement](#0.-Aortic-enlargement)\n- [1. Atelectasis](#1.-Atelectasis)\n- [2. Calcification](#2.-Calcification)\n- [3. Cardiomegaly](#3.-Cardiomegaly)\n- [4. Consolidation](#4.-Consolidation)\n- [5. ILD](#5.-ILD)\n- [6. Infiltration](#6.-Infiltration)\n- [7. Lung Opacity](#7.-Lung-Opacity)\n- [8. Nodule\/Mass](#8.-Nodule\/Mass)\n- [9. Other lesion](#9.-Other-lesion)\n- [10. Pleural effusion](#10.-Pleural-effusion)\n- [11. Pleural thickening](#11.-Pleural-thickening)\n- [12. Pneumothorax](#12.-Pneumothorax)\n- [13. Plumonary fibrosis](#13.-Plumonary-fibrosis)\n- [14. No finding](#14.-No-finding)\n\nNote that a key part of this competition is working with ground truth from multiple radiologists. That means that the same image will have multiple ground-truth labels as annotated by different radiologists.\n\n<br>\n\n\n#### DATA FILES\n\n> **`train.csv`** - the train set metadata, with one row for each object, including a class and a bounding box (multiple rows per image possible)<br>\n**`sample_submission.csv`** - a sample submission file in the correct format\n\n<br>\n\n<b style=\"text-decoration: underline; font-family: Futara;\">TRAIN COLUMNS<\/b>\n> **`image_id`** - unique image identifier<br>\n**`class_name`** - the name of the class of detected object (or \"No finding\")<br>\n**`class_id`** - the ID of the class of detected object<br>\n**`rad_id`** - the ID of the radiologist that made the observation<br>\n**`x_min`** - minimum X coordinate of the object's bounding box<br>\n**`y_min`** - minimum Y coordinate of the object's bounding box<br>\n**`x_max`** - maximum X coordinate of the object's bounding box<br>\n**`y_max`** - maximum Y coordinate of the object's bounding box"}}
