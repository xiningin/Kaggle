The countrywide consequences of the Ebola outbreak on the immunisation programme in Liberia remain largely unknown. No peer-reviewed studies have specifically assessed the effects of the outbreak on child immunisation at national level in affected countries.\n\nThe present study aimed to examine the effects of the Ebola outbreak on national immunisation services, with specific objectives to estimate, at the national level, 1) the number of children aged <1 year who received the recommended vaccines; 2) the number of immunisations given at fixed facilities and outreach settings; and 3) the number of reported cases of measles and pertussis (coqueluche in portughese) among children aged <5 years before, during and after the outbreak.\n\nThe insights from this study will contribute to bridging the knowledge gap on the effects of the outbreak on immunisation services and will guide both the post-Ebola recovery process and strategic planning for future outbreak responses in Liberia and elsewhere. https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5515569\/","d144c397":"Das War's, Kaggle Notebook Runner: Mar\u00edlia Prata  @mpwolke.

The measures necessary to strengthen the generally low level of immunisation coverage (as evidenced by the poor coverage before the Ebola outbreak), to enhance immunity within the population, include a shift of focus from facility-based immunisation to outreach immunisation, scaling up advocacy, communication and social mobilisation to enhance awareness in the community, measures to enhance parents\/guardians' satisfaction and the allocation of more resources and better logistics.https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5515569\/","429459b3":"#The \"No Touch\" Policy\n\nThe Ebola outbreak likely compromised the immunisation programme further. The \u2018no touch\u2019 policy and restriction of invasive procedures, plus the suspension of routine immunisations in some counties during the outbreak, may have resulted in vaccination opportunities being missed. All planned national immunisation campaigns were suspended during the outbreak, and due to human resource constraints, HCWs were not in a position to extend immunisation through outreach services. Likewise, the community perceptions of an increased risk of contracting EVD in health facilities may have prevented care givers from seeking immunisation services for their children.\n\nThe effects of the Ebola outbreak are particularly relevant to the immunisation programme, as children aged \u2a7d4 years are among those with the highest risk for mortality from EVD. This group is also at the highest risk of mortality from other preventable childhood infectious diseases, such as measles, pneumonia and meningitis. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that children receive the following vaccines before 1 year of age: `BACCILLE CALMETTE-GU\u00c9RIN (BCG)`, polio, pentavalent (diphtheria, pertussis, Haemophilus influenze, tetanus, hepatitis B), measles, yellow fever and pneumococcal.13 To attain herd immunity in a target population, immunisation coverage for most antigens should be at least 85%.https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5515569\/","ad09de75":"![](https:\/\/encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com\/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcSmRcXU8ywuDjEfKI7_NY0zk_959SF8mgXhgg&usqp=CAU)facebook.com","66ecb622":"#Did the Ebola outbreak disrupt immunisation services?\nPublished online 2017 Jun 21. doi: 10.5588\/pha.16.0104\nAuthors: C. S. Wesseh,corresponding  R. Najjemba, J. K. Edwards,, P. Owiti,, H. Tweya,, and P. Bhat\n\nResults: Immunisation coverage for fully immunised children before the Ebola outbreak was 73%. Immunisation coverage for all antigens declined by half compared to baseline during the outbreak. These findings were similar in facility-based and outreach immunisations. During the outbreak, the proportion of fully immunised children dropped by respectively 58%, 33% and 39% in the most, moderately and least Ebola-affected counties. Immunisation rate of recovery in the post-Ebola period was respectively 82%, 21% and 9% in the most, moderately and least affected counties compared to the Ebola-outbreak period. Outreach immunisation recovered slowly compared to facility-based immunisation. The mean number of measles cases reported per month was 12 pre-Ebola, 16 Ebola and 60 post-Ebola.\n\nConclusion: This study provides insights into the possible impact of an Ebola outbreak on countrywide immunisation. The outbreak weakened a struggling national immunisation programme, and post-outbreak recovery took significant time, which likely contributed to the measles epidemic.

The first cases of EVD in Liberia were reported in March 2014. The impact of the outbreak overwhelmed an already weak health care system; lapses in infection control at health care facilities led to the deaths of almost half (184\/372) of the health care workers (HCWs) who were infected. This caused alarm among HCWs in facilities due to the risk of EVD, estimated at 30 times higher than in the general population, and many public and private health facilities were temporarily closed. A sense of apprehension was created among those who used health facilities, with significant concerns that they or their family members might contract EVD if they visited these facilities.\n\nAlthough improvements have been reported in the immunisation coverage for most antigens in Liberia, the performance of the national immunisation programme was suboptimal before the outbreak. The 2013 Demographic and Health Survey indicated 55% immunisation coverage for children aged 12\u201323 months,6 and there were repeated measles outbreaks in previous years. This dismal performance may have resulted from the country's intermittent turbulent political past as well as from the significant challenges of maintaining adequate vaccine supplies and managing the necessary cold chain requirements by the Ministry of Health (MoH).https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5515569\/","b5179326":"#Effects of an Outbreak on Countrywide Immunisation Services.\n\nIt's more likely that the total number of diseases preventable by vaccines was actually under-\nreported during and following the Ebola outbreak, making their findings even more notable.\n\nIn conclusion, this study provides insight into the effects of an Ebola outbreak on countrywide immunisation services.
