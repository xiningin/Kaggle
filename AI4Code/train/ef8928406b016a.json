The data is presented by Business Unit and has a list of hourly consumption for the timeperiod the Business Unite existed. Since electrical consumption often correlates to temperature and working days, we can find further data sets as follows.\n\nThe PJM Data set can be downloaded here: \n    https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/robikscube\/hourly-energy-consumption\nThe Daily Temperature of major cities can be downloaded here: \n    https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/sudalairajkumar\/daily-temperature-of-major-cities\nThe major US holidays I have compiled from two sources: \n    https:\/\/www.public-holidays.us\/mobile_US_KF_1998_Federal%20holidays and https:\/\/www.timeanddate.com\/holidays\/us\/\nTo read more about the company, please follow the link: \n    https:\/\/www.pjm.com\/\n\n# Steps to be completed during import and cleansing:\n\n1. clean up each data set\n    This includes checking each file from file from PJM, ensuring that there are no missing hours, and no duplicated hours. If found, the average of the two lines of data surround the situation will be taken and then averaged.\n    This also includes finding the dates of all major US holidays.\n    \n2. combine the data sets into one large pandas dataframe\n\n\nTo set up the environment, we need to import the following libraries. We will also wish to include the datetime library with timedelta, so that we can quickly and accurately assess any cleansing issues in the data. ","6ffbf854":"To quickly check to see if there are any issues in a PJM file, we can create a function that imports a dataframe, df, and then checks for a duration other than an hour. It can be run with each file after basic processing to make a dataframe and after converting the datetime string into a datetime format. It can also be used to check the final combined dataframe.","2fa62ba3":"We will want to breakdown data by weekdays to analyze how work days and non-work days use electricity.
