For example, 'Energy' scale should be between 0 to 1, as described below:\n> Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy.\n\nSo now I think I will translate the data into some sort of standard value.","cbab0641":"# Discussion\n## Speechiness\nIt appears that 'Speechiness' falls under the mean of 0.22 (std=0.25). Now, if we refer to the description from Spotify:\n> Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value. Values above 0.66 describe tracks that are probably made entirely of spoken words. Values between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain both music and speech, either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap music. *Values below 0.33 most likely represent music and other non-speech-like tracks*. \n\nWe can infer that the most popular music in 2019 tends be non-speech-like according to  the standardized value mean. For me personally, to a certain degree, I think songs such as 'Bad Guy'- Bille Ellish or 'You Need to Calm Down' - Taylor Swift, support this analysis.\n\n## Beats Per Minute\nBased on the analysis, I find that the BPM skews left (standardized mean = 0.3, standardized std = 0.2). Now we see again the description from Spotify to infer conclusion:\n> The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece and derives directly from the average beat duration. \n\nEven though the above description denotes that we do not need to standardize BPM, we can still infer that within the range of the given BPM, most of the songs tend to be in the 90-150 BPM (mean = 120, std = 30).\n\n## Valence\nWe can see from 'Valence' that most songs on average skew to the right (standardized mean = 0.5). However, there are still several songs which skew to the left. By definition:\n\n> A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).\n\nThus, we can infer that these 50 songs tend to sound 'happier', 'more cheerful', or 'more euphoric'.\n\n## Energy\nThe output shows that the standardized average score is 0.57. By definition:\n> Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy. \n\nOn average, top 50 songs tend to be 'in the middle', not too 'energetic' nor to 'gloomy'. I think we can just say these music are 'enjoyable' in terms of the 'energy'.\n\n## Loudness\nThe analysis indicates that the average loudness is around -5.6 dB. By definition:\n> The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks. Loudness is the quality of a sound that is the primary psychological correlate of physical strength (amplitude). Values typical range between -60 and 0 db. \n\nThere's not much I can say in terms of loudness, but if I listen the lowest and highest score in terms of loudness in this data, low Loudness sounds 'fatter' or 'deeper', whereas high Loudness indicates 'brighter' or 'crispier' sounds.\n\n# Conclusion and Limitation\nThis is my exploratory analysis which I, again, hope can provide a glimpse of that sense of how data can be used to better understand the nature of an event or occurence or experience. From my analysis, it can be inferred that the top 50 songs on Spotify in 2019 has these five identical characteristics. \n\nThese aspects, of course, is limited with the data provided in the dataset. We can agree that there are a lot of other factors (other than musical parameter) that affect popularity of a song in a certain year. \n\nI hope this can be useful.
