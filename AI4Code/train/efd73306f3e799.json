I bet actual STFT would provide much richer information about any audio. But processing it let alone train any model is far from being practical reality any time soon. Spectrograms do quite good job capturing a gist of a signal.","ff6bb281":"Looks like specie 23 and 17 are either too common or too easily misslabeled as such... or both. Overall I expected class imbalance being far worse.","c9a9aeb5":"### Rainforest, species and songs\nUnsurprisingly, the purpose of species conservation and any afford towards preservation of our environment is dear to my heart. So I cannot avoid this competition.\n\nOne thing I want to remind reader is the purpose we are building it for in this competition. To collapse long arguments I embedded WWF Living Planet Report 2020.

Perhaps picture is not as sexy but still what if there is something?","014a8547":"Okay, here are not much exiting patterns but one: frequencies are roughly in the same range for each specie. Even variations among TP and FP for specie 0 are close to each other."}}
