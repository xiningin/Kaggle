Exploring the data. Learning something. Hopefully this will encourage other Kagglers to think of interesting questions, explore the data. and share their results.\n\nI'll be making extensive use of **maptlotlib & seaborn**.","52c5c0c5":"Create a new data frame dropping all NaN and missing values","a661005c":"#### Model Development using Linear Regression","9d3568d8":"#### What do we see?\n\nThe above correlation values suggest the following:\n\n* Very active minuetes is our best indcator of calories\n* The more active the user the better the indicator of caloric output\n* Sleep and inactivity are our worst indicators ","a2986dba":"# Findings\n\n\n\nBased on the tests above, it appears that we can accept the null hypothesis that activity has an impact on caloric output \n\nThe company can use this data to improve their app and fitbit tracker by implementing programs that reward high intensity work outs. A feature could be added to the app that allows users to see their predicted caloric output based on intensity and duration on the planned workout. Additionally, the app could create programs that incentivise hitting a certain number of steps for a day.
