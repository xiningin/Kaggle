But males are worse off than females. \n\nHigher healthcare infrastructure,indicated by hospibed, plays an important role in reducing mortality. We see a negative correlation between deaths and the same. Also higer per capita expenditure improves healthcare infrastructure and per person availablity of health resources could reduce tackling mortality. \n\nAgain, mortality doesn't depend on the income level of the country and how much they invest in healthcare expenditure, but how the expenditure in distributed among the population and how well people could avail them,as discussed above. As we see the top ten countries with highest mortalities, most of the world superpowers including (US and China) are present in that.","c4298677":"# Analysis of Smokers and incidence of death","c859d664":"# Correlation Study","77dc8a83":"These are the countries where the healthcare per capita falls in the critical range and has number of confirmed cases greater than 300.","4e60b45e":"From the most affected countries, we could see that the number of hospital beds per 1k population varies between 2 - 5 beds per 1k population and country with maxium number of hospital beds per 1k population ofhas lower death cases as compared to the ones in the given range.This could further imply the more the population level at given health expenditure the pie gets smaller and hence this could be seen.","8802b75d":"There has been a world wide study on whether smokers are more vulnerable to the sickness. Although there hasn't been any solid concluded ground in which we could put forth this as an true argument. Researhers have come up with mixed findings related to this.\n\nIn the density plot we see that although the plot is significantly dense in the areas where we have lower than median smokers with lower mortality, a fair portion of higher mortality is observed at lower range of smokers and sometime lower mortality at higher range of smoker is also seen. \n\nThis is evidient from the incidence of the deaths and smokers in the pandemic countries that deaths and somkers are negatively correlated. The line of average is negatively sloped. A study based in France, says that nicotine might prevent smokers from contracting the sickness and potentially blocks the virus from attaching to the cells. But if a patient catches the sickness, a smoker is more likely to have aggravated health situation. \nHowever, this argument doesn't advocate intake of nicotine based products as an preemtive action against coronavirus, owing to the universally accepted fact about the harmful health-effects of nicotine consumption.\n\nHowever, in the countries with least mortality, in the third graph above, we see an opposite picture. Mortality is higher with higher somkers. \n\nSince, the final conclusion is slightly ambiguous in nature, a further suggestive study as we have done with healthcare expenditure per capita, may be misleading in various aspect. ","4ea7e3c8":"# Scatter Plot Analysis on Variables","bab10b59":"As we see the density is highest in the lower levels of the per capita health expenditure, among the pandemic countries. \nWe have noted before that higher healthcare infrastructure could help tackle the mortality rate.
