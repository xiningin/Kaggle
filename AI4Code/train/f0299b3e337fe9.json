The data is plubic domain and was made available through [Mobius](http:\/\/https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/arashnic). All responses collected came from 33 unique Fitbit users. All users consented to be a part of the data collection process. The personal tracker data collected measured for the following: daily activties, daily steps, heart rate, and sleep.\n\n*Cleaning the Data*\n\nBy scanning and cleaning the datasets we can verify the integrity of the data. Once cleaned and verified we are able to run all analyses.\n\nIn this session we first scanned the data set in the Global Environment Tab to check for mispelling, any missing values, or data that may have been entered incorectly. Once scanning is complete we moved forward with removing all null values and verifying that all were removed. Afterwards we procedded with summarizing the data sets to ensure everything was ready to run analyses. \n\n\n\n","86efb40b":"**Analyzing the Data**\n\n***Plotting a Few Explorations***\n\n*Daily Activity*\n\nFor the Daily Activity data set we first measured the relationship between amount of *Total Steps* walked and the amount of *Calories* burned.

Some of these products include the \u201cLeaf\u201d, a wellness tracker, \u201cTime\u201d, a wellness watch, and \u201cSpring\u201d, a water bottle that can track your daily water intake. The company has come as for to developing the \u201cBellabeat app\u201d that allows their users to keep track of their health-related data such as exercising activities they complete, sleep cycles, stress, and menstrual cycles. Bellabeat also offers month-to-month memberships that allows their users to fully personalize and track their nutrition, exercise, sleep, health, beauty, and mindfulness.\n\n**Current Project**\n\nFor this current project we have been asked by Bellabeat\u2019s cofounders Ur\u0161ka Sr\u0161en and Sando Mur, and Bellabeat\u2019s marketing analytics team to gain better insights on how current Bellabeat product consumers use their products and then provide insightful recommendations for continued growth and future marketing strategies. \n\nWe will be analyzing smart device usage from non-Bellabeat smart devices to later compare them to that of Bellabeat\u2019s to answer the following questions:\n\n1. What are some trends in smart device usage?\n    \n2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?\n    \n3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?","25ee5c5b":"***Summarizing Findings***\n\n*Daily Activity*"}}
