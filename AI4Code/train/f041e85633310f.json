Because it is well known, its influence over governments is growing. Many heads of state and government fear its annual publication. The Index is a point of reference that is quoted by media throughout the world and is used by diplomats and international entities such as the United Nations and the World Bank.\n\n**WHAT DOES IT MEASURE?**\n\nThe Index ranks 180 countries and regions according to the level of freedom available to journalists. It is a snapshot of the media freedom situation based on an evaluation of pluralism, independence of the media, quality of legislative framework and safety of journalists in each country and region. It does not rank public policies even if governments obviously have a major impact on their country\u2019s ranking. Nor is it an indicator of the quality of journalism in each country or region.\n\n**THE GLOBAL INDICATOR AND REGIONAL INDICATORS**\n\nAlong with the Index, RSF calculates a global indicator and regional indicators that evaluate the overall performance of countries and regions (in the world and in each region) as regards media freedom. It is an absolute measure that complements the Index\u2019s comparative rankings. The global indicator is the average of the regional indicators, each of which is obtained by averaging the scores of all the countries in the region, weighted according to their population as given by the World Bank.\n\n**HOW THE INDEX IS COMPILED**\n\nThe degree of freedom available to journalists in 180 countries and regions is determined by pooling the responses of experts to a questionnaire devised by RSF. This qualitative analysis is combined with quantitative data on abuses and acts of violence against journalists during the period evaluated. The criteria used in the questionnaire are pluralism, media independence, media environment and self-censorship, legislative framework, transparency, and the quality of the infrastructure that supports the production of news and information.\n\nSource: <a>https:\/\/rsf.org\/<\/a>","ee014653":"---","389df8c6":"## Import dataset","ab18727c":"![](https:\/\/rsf.org\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/rsf_full\/public\/regions_visuel_rsfindex_20205.png?itok=mGeHSptE&timestamp=1618825403)","b4e8858e":"# World Press Index (2021)\n### Context\nThis is an attempt to understand how different nations treat journalists and journalism in general, throughout the world.\n\n### Content\nThis is a dataset comprising of 180 countries.\n\n***Abuse Score*** : This score is evaluated by experts, based on the violence and abuse caused in a country against journalists and this score is then used a weight metric with the Underlying Situation score to judge the final Global score.
