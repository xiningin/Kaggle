Most data scientists (121 [27%]) have 5\u201310 years of experience. Nearly 40% of software engineers reported that they have 20+ years of experience, and this is true across all job titles (427 [21.3%]).","54f979ac":"Question 7 of the survey asked which programming languages participants use on a regular basis. Python, SQL, R, Java, and JavaScript were the top 5, with the majority of respondents using Python regularly. However, the data shows that most statisticians favor R in their day-to-day work.\n\nThe heat map below illustrates the most popular programming languages for Kaggle users.","abf7fc8c":"What makes a data scientist a data scientist? Or a data analyst a data analyst? Just like with the term \u201cbig data,\u201d there are many definitions of these roles. The field of data science and machine learning continues to grow and evolve, and so do the job titles (and job responsibilities) for these fields.\n\nBecause the field of data science is still relatively new and continues to grow, there is no general consensus on how to define the many interrelated roles in the industry. Responsibilities tend to overlap, particularly in smaller companies where there may not be a dedicated data team. The term \u201cdata scientist\u201d is still so new that the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (2021) does not list a category for this role\u2014data scientists and data analysts would likely fall within the category of Database Administrators and Architects, and related categories include Computer Programmers and Computer and Information Research Scientists.\n\nThe National Center for O\\*NET Development (2021) provides slightly better data regarding job titles in the data science field. Its current data set for alternate titles lists various data science job titles, including clinical data managers (14 alternate titles), data entry keyers (82 alternate titles), data scientists (24 alternate titles), data warehousing specialists (11 alternate titles), database administrators (29 alternate titles), and database architects (46 alternate titles).\n\nIn their recent paper \u201cA Data Science Approach to Defining a Data Scientist,\u201d Ho et al. (2019) concluded that \u201cthe title of \u2018Data Scientist\u2019 is still a new concept that has and will continue to evolve as the role molds to the needs of artificial intelligence and business requirements. Our current definition is the result of the current market\u2019s view via job postings. Additional future work is required to capture a higher accuracy. . . . For future work, additional data such as surveys, in person interviews with working data scientists, and web scraping additional websites could provide a more well-rounded (and accurate) prediction on the definition and skill set.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the best way to determine who does what in the data science and machine learning field is to analyze job postings. In a blog post on KDnuggets, Theuwissen (2015) summarizes the job titles of data scientist, data analyst, data architect, data engineer, statistician, database administrator, business analyst, and data and analytics manager based on relevant job postings. He also lists the most popular programming languages, salary ranges, and roles within a team for each of these jobs.\n\nVerma et al. (2019) also examined a sample of online job postings for titles such as business analyst, business intelligence analyst, data analyst, and data scientist using content analysis, focusing on four U.S. states: Arkansas, Florida, Missouri, and Kansas. They concluded that \u201cthe [business analyst] category appears to be the least technical of the four studied job categories. The [business analyst] jobs require a high degree of domain knowledge whereas the [business intelligence analyst] jobs focus strongly on structured data management skills along with some knowledge of statistics. The requirements for [data analyst] overlap with those for [data scientist] in the areas of decision-making and organization skills. Compared to the [data analyst] jobs, the [data scientist] ones strongly rely on statistical and programming skills.\u201d\n\nThe analysis in this notebook aims to provide a comprehensive overview of job titles and job responsibilities within the U.S. data science field. It examines demographic information such as age, gender, and levels of education as well as technology use and participants\u2019 salaries and years of experience.","6d73e01a":"A total of 590 participants responded to Question 24, Part 5, which asked if respondents perform \u201cexperimentation and iteration to improve existing ML [machine learning] models\u201d as part of their typical job responsibilities.
