Below we look at the raw measurement data, in descending order of happiness score. The cells are coloured so that the larger values in the column are darker.\n\nSome trends are immediately obvious:\n\n1) Factors closely linked with economic development, (i.e. GDP per capita, social support, and healthy life expectancy) are very strongly linked with happiness score.\n\n2) There are some noticable exceptions to the above. In particular, many countries seem to be happier than their economy would suggest. Costa Rica in particular has a very high happiness score given its GDP per capita. ","530eb4b6":"Box plots of happiness score show that cluster 2 is the happiest, with clusters 0 and 1 having similar median happiness, but cluster 1 having a much larger range.

","5177ffe0":"Here we see the radar chart for the two happiness outliers, Singapore and Costa Rica. Costa Rica was much happier than other nations in cluster 0 while Singapore was much less happy than other countries in cluster 2. It is easy to see why Singapore was in cluster 2, as it is very economically developed and has a low level of percieved corruption. Similarly, Costa Rica matches the profile of cluster 0, though with a high GDP per capita and healthy life expectancy for that cluster. Given that the happiness score for Costa Rica is 7.12 and for Singapore is 6.38, it seems clear that Costa Rica has something extra that is making it a happy country that is not captured by this data.","fa79198e":"## Conclusions\n\nThe most important factor in the happiness of a nation is economic development, as can be seen from the correlation matrix we produced in the overview section. Generosity seems to have little to do with the happiness of a nation, but the increased social support increases happiness exponentially. The perception of corruption within a nation only shows a small correlation with happiness, and only once the perception of corruption falls below about 0.6. \n\nAlthough happiness worldwide has remained fairly constant on average over the years 2015-2020, the difference between the happiest and least happy countries has grown. The biggest increases in happiness between 2015-2020 were seen in West Africa. The biggest drop in happiness over the same time period was in Venezuela. \n\nWe can divide the happiest quartile of countries into three clusters. The first cluster (consisting mostly of Northern Europe) is the happiest, richest, and perceives the lowest levels of corruption. The second (consisting mostly of Southern Europe and the USA) is almost as rich as the first, but perceives more corruption. The third cluster (consisting mostly of central and South American countries) is not as rich as the first two, but freer than the second. This third cluster is almost as happy as the second, despite being much poorer economially. \n\nWe can see that there are factors that contribute to happiness that are not found in this data set. This is clear from looking at two significant outliers: Singapore and Costa Rica. Singapore beats Costa Rica on every measure apart from freedom, where they are almost equal, but Costa Rica is much happier. "}}
