been earmarked by investors as being too expensive and inefficient to be financially feasible in  any manner. However, with the advancement of green technologies and a shift in global perceptions towards climate change over the past decade, they have been growing in prominence and attractiveness, and are looking poised to overtake traditional fossil fuels as the main energy source over the next decade or two. \n\nHowever, how viable is renewable energy really compared to fossil fuels? As an business owner\/investor, would it really be in my best interest to invest into clean energy? We invesetigate several key issues surrounding the adoption of renewable energies, and therefore find the intersection between corporate and environmental concerns.

In fact, for every academic study or journal that denounce such laws for their economic harm,  are a dozen more that conclude that the savings from improved health outcomes are more than sufficient to cover any economic pain the poor might face in the short-term.\n\nIs this true though? Climate change denialists would argue that it is all a charlatan's ruse. We will certify this with some data. \n\nFirst, we explore the idea that environmental degradation may incur huge costs for populations. Logically, one would think of the social and economic costs borne by society due to sickness and premature deaths from phenomenon such as increased pollution, unsafe water sources, lead poisoning etc. Indeed, we confirm this hypothesis by finding a strong correlation between PM2.5 readings and deaths by particulate matter air pollution. \n\n","3a090ee9":"While the median company still makes only about 2% of their revenue from low-carbon products in 2020, this is a rise from the  previous years of 1%, and if we extend it to the 75th percentile, we find a marked increase from 25% to 29.5%, which is promising. There are also a group of companies that make a 100% of their revenue from low-carbon products, but this is likely from the nature of the product they are selling. ","caf2340e":"Ironically, another way that environmental protection may help level the playing field is in terms of employment. In the same study by OECD that showed the deterioration of energy sectors due to GHG mitigation policies, they also found that the jobs created in renewable energy were not only more abudnant than those lost in energy, but that they were largely proportionate in terms of skill level. \n","f1d797f1":"This much is obvious. However, after digging deeper, we find a more troubling trend. Countries who are the greatest contriubtors of carbon emissions are not necessarily the ones who suffer the most emissions-related deaths. In fact, we find that in general, richer economies contribute marginally more carbon emissions while suffering lower mortality,while the countries with the highest mortality tend to have lower GDP. The obvious exceptions are China and India, but these are rapidly industrializing countries with huge inequality issues of their own. So it seems logical to conclude that this is a form of environmental inequity, and any measures to alleviate it will also help in attenuating this death inequality.","025d1f8a":"Of course, the estimates for these costs vary, and Lazard's own estimation for the average cost of solar PV puts it below the combined cycle power plant at 0.036. Whichever the case though, this shows that the most common renewables, solar photovoltaic and onshore wind, are price-competitive with fossil fuels in terms of running costs.  \n\nThen, we move on to the initial capital costs, the barrier to entry for all energy aspirants. This is typically measured using overnight cost per watt. As of 2019, the estimated average capital costs per kilowatt for coal is 3500, while for gas\/oil combined cycle it is 1000. Most renewables have fallen below the installed price of coal as of 2019, but only solar PV is able to compete with the combined cycle power plant.","0719857a":"\nA naive approach would be to plot the Gini index of a population with a proxy of enviromental performance (such as pollution readings) over time. However, this would be grossly unrepresentative, because in reality income inequality in a nation is dependent on a host of macroeconomic factors, and is in fact usually hardly impacted by environemntal policy, due to its relatively small contribution to overall GDP.","26185432":"### So what's stopping people?\n\nI have not shown all sides of this argument, naturally. It would be impossible to capture all political, economic, (and administrative?) contexts unique to each region that might possibly act as a roadblock for providers of renewable energy. However, the fact is that renewables have seen widespread success in many regions across the world. In Europe, especially, there have been many success stories. I have already mentioned Germany, but the other EU states are perhaps even more impressive. The UK and Denmark have achieved 50% renewable usage, and Scotland, incredibly, is on track to power 100% of its domestic electricity consumption with clean energy by the end of this year. \n\nAll this was achieved wfrom a collaboration of public and private sectors, with governments generously supplying subsidies and infrastructures and the business owners managing the production and distribution. The Aberdeen Renewable Energy Group (AREG), for instance,  is a public-private partnership created in Scotland to identify and promote renewable energy opportunities for businesses in the country. \n\nThe existence of such exemplars, together the aforementioned factors of costs, reliability, and investment potential, suggest that the inability of other developed nations to transition to renewables stems from factors besides economic. For rapidly industrializing economies, the situation is more fraught, but that doesn't mean that they cannot contribute in small ways. I[ndia has committed to reducing their greenhouse gas emissions intensity by 33% from 2005 to 2030](https:\/\/www.globalenergyinstitute.org\/indias-conditional-unconditional-climate-pledge), and [China has pledged to reach \"peak carbon\" by 2030 and zero emissions by 2060](https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/environment\/2020\/sep\/27\/china-carbon-pledge-put-energy-system-reverse-wind-solar). Although it still remains to be seen whether they can deliver on these promises, the conditions seem favorable for a smooth transition, and perhaps a day may come when it becomes more economically vialbe to adopt renewables as the primary energy source. For the whole world, it only seems a matter of time. \n\n","f2ee1ffc":"## What about energy-efficient companies? \n\nNot all companies need to be in the energy sector to make a difference to climate change, though.

It was undoubtedly a huge boon for our development, but it did not come without its own share of growing pains. For instance, the benefits of the revolution were not equally available to everyone. The proletariat famously had to endure terrible working conditions, proffer child workers, and suffer all manner of pollution-related sicknesses and deaths. Even worse, the subjugated natives of the European colonies were the ones who had to pay the heavy price of these ravenous processes, and only got to enjoy the fruits of their labour via the breadcrumbs of their colonial masters.\n\nNow,  we are in the midst of a \u201cGreen Revolution\u201d. And have no doubt, it is certainly underway. For instance:\n\n1. Governments are increasing funding for research on environemntal protection and subsidies for clean energies, spurred in part by the rise of climate-induced natural distasters.\n\n2. Advancements in  renewable energy have made them more attractive to business owners nad invesetors than ever before..\n\n3. Increased pressure from civil society groups on governments and business enact climate change mitigation policies. \n\nThe only question is at what speed it will occur, and whether the thousands of preventable deaths due to food shortages, extreme weather conditions, and displacement of people at coastal areas can be avoided.\n\nBut beyond the rate of uptake, we cannot neglect the other elephant in the room, which is how to perform this transition equitably. We can find a lot of parallels with the first Industrial Revolution in this sense, especially with regards to how not all groups will benefit equally from a green transition in the short term. In this notebook, we aim to explore the aspects of this inequity, and aim to propose some KPIs to healp quanitfy the progress made in achieving environmental goals, while not compromising on equity. ","4dad0eb8":"### 1. Price of Renewables\n\nCosts in producing energy can be broadly broken into two categories. First, is the capital costs involved to set up the infrastructure and machinery needed to generate the energy, whether that comes in the form a power plant, or wind farms. The second are the costs for the production of the energy itself, the \"running costs of the operation\". \n\nWe start with running costs. Running costs can be quite handily summarized with the levelized cost of energy (LROE)  metric, which takes the sum of costs over a plant's lifetime and divides it by the sum of electricity produced over its lifetime. Taken over many plants, this provides a good estimate for us to compare the running costs of different energy types. The data below was collected by IRENA, and shows declining LCOEs for renewables over time. We use Lazard's estimation of LCOE for gas combined cycle power plant and coal for 2020.","bf739b4c":"It is interesting to note that the pollution inequality at the state level is not very high.

This is especially egregious if the workers do not have the requisite skills or opportunities to transition to new jobs in the renewable energy sector.\n\nFor instance, a hot-button topic in US politics involves the decline in manufacturing and energy jobs in the Rust Belt, supposedly spurred by \"job-killing\" environmental regulations.  \n\nWhile the decline in manufacturing jobs over the decades has more to do with cheaper labor costs overseas and US trade agreements, it is true that the energy sectors have been greatly pressured by the regulations.

However, the issues we discussed above were not for naught; they will help play a key role in the formulation of these KPIs.

Thus demonstrating the legitimacy of the metric.\n\nHowever, some may take issue with this interpretation of pollution levels, and for good reason. Here, we are treating PM 2.5 levels as a uniform measure with every unit having the same (negative) value. So, with our current version, we would view 2 states with 5\u00b5g\/m\u00b3 annually as being as bad as 1 state with 105\u00b5g\/m\u00b3 annually. However, this is clearly at odds with reality. A measurement of 5\u00b5g\/m\u00b3 is usually considered 'a clear and non-hazy day', [while EPA researchers have associated PM 2.5 levels of 10\u00b5g\/m\u00b3 with higher incidence of pollution-related death in black communities](https:\/\/www.pri.org\/stories\/2020-01-07\/air-pollution-silent-killer-even-when-it-meets-epa-standards).

After all, environmental regulations may help curtail some of the actions of these polluting industries, but at the expense of society's welfare since energy is a necessity\\.

","0096eb4a":"We start by considering the most intuitive choice for measuring equity, which is the commmonly used Gini index. The Gini is a single-value measure of the inequality (usually income) in a population.

So, it would be prudent for us to calculate an employment-wealth Gini from this as well. However, this is where we run into a roadblock, because unfortunately there is no publicly available dataset containing information on renewable jobs AND energy jobs created on the state\/country level. (believe me, I've looked) \n\nSo we have to make do with a proxy. Fortunately, we can use an important finding confirmed independently by many pieces of peer-reviewed research, which is that renewable energy tends to create more jobs than it removes per unit energy produced compared to fossil fuels - up to 12 times, some say. So, in our analyis, we can safely make a worst-case assumption that a unit of energy produced for renewables is equivalent in job production\/loss to a unit produced for fossil fuels. \n\nFortunately for us, data for renewable and fossil fuel energy generation is available for US states. So we can subtract the difference in fossil fuel generation over years from renewable generation to get the net energy change for each state. So we take the change in these energy generation levels as a very rough proxy for employment in these areas. (An approach with many limitations, but we makek do with what we have). Here, we calculate Ginis for renewable energy generation, fossil fuel generation, and net energy change = renewable energy change - fossil fuel energy change. Since the Net Energy Change column has negative values which is incompatible with Gini, we normalize by adding the minimum value in the year to all values. \n","a604291d":"We see that on the  years where most states saw a rise in net energy generation, the inequality index is lower, while during years that had mixed changes in energy generation, inequality index is high.

Another persepective we could take is by viewing a state's fossil fuel dependence, which is simply their fossil fuel energy generation\/total energy generation. \n\nThis is useful because it shows us 1. which states have successfully transitioned to renewables, and which ones are still stuck on fossil fuels, which we can roughly approximate to employment in these sectors, and 2. the future employment prospects of that state. Many economic studies and papers have confirmed the inexorable decline of fossil fuels, so we would like them all states to reduce fossil fuel reliance anyway.

In other words, public funds spent on green projects such as renewable energy investments  or reforestation etc. could  have been used for schemes that more directly benefit the poor, such as food subsidies and public education. This may result in a welfare loss for society if the legislation does not bring aboout a commensurate positive impact that covers the costs. \n\nFor instance, a common way of measuring the economic efficacy of environmental policies is via a marginal carbon abatement curve (MACC), which is an estimation of the volumes and costs of opportunities to reduce emissions in a given year. This allows policymakers to easily compare the relative costs and GHG emissions reductions of each course of action. Here, we see that the most effective environmental policies are also the most expensive, resulting in these funds being unable to be used for poverty-alleviating measures instead.

Investment potential of renewables \n\nInvestor sentiment is an indispensable factor when it comes to business feasibility. It can be said that even the CEO of a company is just another employee in the eyes of its shareholders.

They first identified some \"pure play\" companies in renewable energy and fossil fuels in  Germany\/France,the UK and the US, using them to build two separate portfolios respectively. They then analyzed the activity of these two portfolios over 5 and 10 year period. They found that renewables yielded a 178.2% return over -20.7% for fossil fuel investments over a 5 year period for France+Germany, 75.4% compared to 8.8% returns for the UK, and 200.3% against 97.2% for the US.\n\n![Returns](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/UUjY4oY.png)\n\nIf renewables are such a lucrative market, why aren't more instituational investors jumping on?

Still, even on this front, this may not be the case for long. Investment in renewable energy has been steadily rising for the past decade and governments have already pledged a collective US$1 trillion on clean energy in the next decade, so it seems only a matter of time until the market becomes deep and tested enough to inspire the confidence of shareholders. Maybe then, it will reach the crucial inflexion point it needs to really take off.\n\n","8a0c64d2":"In conclusion, it seems that costs should not be a deterrent for businesses to switch from fossil fuels to the most cost efficient renewables.

There are many ways to measure environmental health of a community: through level of pollution, water security,climate vulnerability etc. For this part, however, we will be mainly exploring pollution as quantified by annual PM 2.5 levels, since this is the only information that is widely available and easily understood.  \n\nPM 2.5 Levels are usually measured across a large area (eg. city\/state level. Therefore, we will utilize area-based Gini coefficient (AR-Gini), where each area is treated as an a uniform group in the Gini tabulation. \n\nSince we are using a discretized version of Gini, the formula of Gini coefficient is defined as follows:\n\n$$ G = 1 - \\sum\\limits_{k=1}^{k=n-1} {(x_k - x_{k+1})(y_k + y_{k+1}) } $$\n\nwhere y is the cumulative sum of the dependent variable (eg. PM 2.5 level) in the kth state, x is the cumulative sum of the population in the kth state, k is the number of states.\n\n(Note: this is equivalent to the geometric definition we saw before, where G = A\/(A+B). Since A+B = 0.5, we have G = 2A = 1 - 2B. B is the Lorenz curve and can be estimated by trapezoids defined by the x\/y values, which is represented in the second term in our equation above.)\n\nLet's illustrate the concept of Environmental Gini with the USA.  We would like for our Gini to summarize the change in inequality of pollution across its population. We could achieve this in several ways. First, we could treat each state as a separate entity and calculate the Gini as if there were only that number of people. Here, we only have PM 2.5 data for 47 states, so we will be calculating it as if the US is a 47 person population. Doing so for the year 2003 yields this graph:\n"}}
