the world require information related to this virus. Although papers are a good source of the information, the number is huge, and they contain many technical terms, so it is a hard work to decide which paper to read and understand whole contents. Therefore, our goal is to pick up paragraphs in paper which likely contain answers to our questions and process them into easily understandable format.\n\n\n### Idea\n* JSON files supplied by Kaggle contain the information of paragraph (indicated by \\n\\n). Analysis on each paragraph enables extracting more compact and important part of the dataset.\n\n\n### Pros\n* We separated the body text into finer units (paragraphs) to get more specific results.\n* In the process of construction of DataFrame, handling body text by each paragraph extremely increase the number of repetitions in \"for loop\" to append data and this makes execution very slow. Making dictionary first and use \"from_dict\" method solved this problem.\n* Selecting paragraphs by Word Clouds helped us to scan the contents.\n\n### Cons\n* The visualization of the LDA topic model gives us some insight, but takes time so we skipped this step, unfortunately (commented-out).\n\n\n### Conclusion\nJudging from Word Clouds and papers found by, our approach seems successful to extract the important parts of the papers. However, evaluation of unsupervised learning is difficult. Having people use this program and getting feedback will make us understand where we stand and what to improve.\n\n\n### References\n\u201cTopic Modeling: Finding Related Articles\u201d by Daniel Wolffram.\n\n\n### Acknowledgment\nWould like to thank the note book \u201cTopic Modeling: Finding Related Articles\u201d by Wolffram\u2019s team and their wonderful work, \"discovid.ai\".\n\n","efbf09af":"# Widget: Free Text Search","3f05fa10":"# Widget: Pick a COVID-19-Paper ","27aa213a":"# Get Nearest Papers (in Topic Space)","883e840f":"## Discovered Topics"}}
