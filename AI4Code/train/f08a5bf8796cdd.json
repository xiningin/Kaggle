Check out the below figure ([Figure_1](#figure_1)) that shows how China started as a low-income economy in 1990 and is moving towards becoming a high-income economy. \n<a id=\"figure_1\"><\/a>\n<script type='text\/javascript' src='https:\/\/dataviz.worldbank.org\/javascripts\/api\/viz_v1.js'><\/script><div class='tableauPlaceholder' style='width: 750px; height: 654px;'><object class='tableauViz' width='750' height='654' style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fdataviz.worldbank.org%2F' \/> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' \/> <param name='site_root' value='&#47;t&#47;DECDG' \/><param name='name' value='gni_and_thresholds&#47;final' \/><param name='tabs' value='no' \/><param name='toolbar' value='yes' \/><param name='showAppBanner' value='false' \/><param name='display_count' value='no' \/><param name='display_spinner' value='no' \/><param name='filter' value='iframeSizedToWindow=true' \/><\/object><\/div>\n> **Figure_1**: * Source [[7](#ref_7)]. The economy in many countries improve over time. For instance, in this graph, we can see how China moves from being a low-income economy in 1990 towards becoming a high-income economy. *\n\nAs shown in [Figure_1](#figure_1), economies tend to improve over time. In 1990, 6 in 10 humans lived in low-income economy and now only 1 in 10 humans still live in low-income economy [[7](#ref_7)]. \n\n[Figure_2](#figure_2) shows how the share of world population living in low-income countries has decreased from 60% to less than 10%. People who were under the low income category became part of the middle income categories. The share of world population living in high income countries remained almost the same at around 15% because it is very difficult for high income countries to grow at high rates.\n\n<a id=\"figure_2\"><\/a>\n![](https:\/\/drive.google.com\/uc?export=download&id=1XGzDivLXH9VA3h3E2ZlAiX2vGVYABF72)\n> **Figure_2**: * Source [[7](#ref_7)]. The share of world population living in low-income countries has decreased from 60% to less than 10%. The share of world population living in high income countries remained almost the same at around 15%. *\n\nSo far, we have talked about what SWOT is and how the World Bank categorizes the economies of the countries around the world. In the next section, we will get to know the countries that are part of the Kaggle Survey - 2019. ","6a0f12a0":"<a id=\"figure_19\"><\/a>\n> **Figure_19**: *a chart showing the salaries of different professions in the survey.*\n\nNow that we know have a clear idea about salaries, let's see the unemployment rate. As shown in [Figure_20](#figure_20), the unemployment rate for people with only a high school degree is very high. Earning a university degree significantly increases the likelihood of being employed. In high income countries, the unemployment rate drops from 4% for people with a bachelors degree to 3% if a person earns a doctoral degree. People with a masters degree in upper-middle income and lower-middle income countries reported having higher unemployment rate than those who have a bachelor degree only. However, people with a doctoral degree in upper-middle income countries have the lowest unemployment rate which is only 2.5%. In other words, having a doctoral degree in an upper-middle income country makes a lot of sense as the unemployment rate is very low. The same applies to lower-middle income countries where people with a doctoral degree reported having lower uneployment rate. Let's update our SWOT matrix with this information.","19394175":"# Section_3: Getting to know the Countries in the Survey\n<a id=\"section_3\"><\/a>\n![](https:\/\/drive.google.com\/uc?export=download&id=1X0iLDBQZYObLLaQbJd5kfJyaS4S8O3IV)\n\nLet's try to explore the countries that are represented in the Kaggle survey.

However, if we normalize the gap with respect to the male salary, we see a different kind of picture. As shown in [Figure_10](#figure_10), after salary normalization, we can see that the largest gap is in lower-middle income countries because the gap is 90% (males earn twice as much as females).

The figure only shows the formal education of people who work as a Data Scientist. Clearly, a masters degree significantly increases your chances of being employed as a data scientist. In high and upper-middle income economies, more than half of the data scientists have a masters degree. For middle income countries, the percentage of data scientists who have a doctoral degree is lower than those who have a bachelor degree. In fact, in lower-middle income countries, only 6% of the data scientists have a doctoral degree compared to 26% in high income countries.

In upper-middle income countries, data scientists who have a masters or doctoral degrees earn higher salaries than those with only a bachelor degree. In fact, in upper-middle income countries, data scientists who have a doctoral degree can expect to be paid around 50% more than those who only have a bachelor degree. Unfortunately, this trend is not the same in lower-middle income countries where data scientists who have a doctoral degree reported having lower average yearly salary than those who have a bachelor degree. In low-middle income economies, the average annual salary of people with masters degrees is higher than those who have either a bachelor degree or a doctoral degree. In other words, in a lower-middle income economy, the ideal degree that is likely to yield the highest salary is a masters degree.","ad4388b6":"<a id=\"figure_21\"><\/a>\n> **Figure_21**: *shows the SWOT matrix updated with jobs analysis (shown in bold)*\n\nFinally, we finished the SWOT analysis from 4 different angles: Gender, Age, Education, and Jobs.

The percentage of female participants in lower-middle income countries (17.08%) is slightly better than the percentage of female participants in high income countries (16.93%).

Whether you are interested in visiting, living, or working in a country, each country has its own competitive advantage. In other words, each country has some strengths and some weaknesses. This inspired me to create this notebook. In this notebook, we will analyze the data from the Kaggle Survey 2019. We will use the SWOT analysis [[1](#ref_1), [2](#ref_2), [3](#ref_3)] as a framework to guide us. There are 4 components of a SWOT analysis:\n* Strengths\n* Weaknesses\n* Opportunities\n* Threats\n\nIt is worth mentioning that a SWOT analysis is typically used when making decisions. However, it can also be used to capture the state of a business, a competition, a concept or pretty much anything you want. We will learn more about SWOT in [Section_1](#section_1). \n\nIn this notebook, we will use the World Bank categorization of the countries around the world. The World Bank categorizes countries based on their economy into 4 groups: \n* Low income\n* Lower-middle income\n* Upper-middle income\n* High income\n\nThe Kaggle 2019 survey only contains data about countries belonging to lower-middle income, upper-middle income, and high income categories. There's no data for low income countries (this is likely because the number of responses from these countries are below 50). We will perform the SWOT analysis on the following 3 income groups: lower-middle income, upper-middle income, and high income categories. We will learn more about the World Bank classification in [Section_2](#section_2). \n\nIn [Section_3](#section_3), we will learn more about the income groups available in the survey. Then, we will perform the SWOT analysis from four different angles: gender ([Section_4](#section_4)), age ([Section_5](#section_5)), education ([Section_6](#section_6)), and jobs ([Section_7](#section_7)).

In this notebook, we used the World Bank countries classification to analyze the Kaggle survey. The World Bank classifies countries based on economy into 4 categorizes: Low income, Lower-middle income, Upper-middle income, and High income. The survey has 30 countries that are classified as high income countries and this group include: the US, Canada, Germany, and the UK. The Upper-middle income group in the survey is composed of 14 countries and include: Brazil, China, and Russia. Finally, the lower-middle income group is composed of 12 countries and include: India, Nigeria, and Indonesia. \n\nWe used the SWOT framework to capture the state of each income group from 4 different angles: Gender, Age, Education, and Jobs. SWOT stands for **S**trengths, **W**eaknesses, **O**pportunities, and **T**hreats. The SWOT Matrix shown in [Figure_22](#figure_22) summarizes the state of the 3 income groups in the survey.\n\nThank you. \n\n","364607ce":"# Section_5: Age\n<a id=\"section_5\"><\/a>\n![](https:\/\/drive.google.com\/uc?export=download&id=1A7TkbctR6UamNVN5hk3vTTTvveg1I8tt)\n\nEconomic growth is tightly related to the population demographics [[11](#ref11)]. One of the main reasons for why the economic growth has been slowing down is because of a lower productivity gains (new people entering the workforce). This trend is being noticed in high income countries but also started happening recently in middle income groups but at a lower rate [[12](#ref12), [13](#ref13)]. \n\nLet's explore the age of the participants in the survey. [Figure_13](#Figure_13) shows the distribution of age for all 3 income groups. We can clearly see that lower-middle income countries have a younger population. More than 50% of Kagglers in lower-middle income countries tend to be younger than 24 years old. On the other hand, for both high income and upper-middle income countries, Kagglers are on average older. More than 55% of the Kagglers in upper-middle income countries are younger than 30 years old. Kagglers in high income countries are the oldest with 62% aging 30 years old and above.","5eee24fd":"<a id=\"figure_10\"><\/a>\n> **Figure_10**: *the largest gap is in lower-middle income countries because the gap is 90% (males earn twice as much as females).

Men and women face different expectations when it comes to education and work [[9](#ref_9)]. The gender gap refers to the fact that women earn less than men in many areas. In some countries, women are not given the same opportunity to study and work. \n\nFurthermore, gender gap slows economic growth and it is costing the world economy trillions of dollars [[10](#ref_10)]. According to the IMF, closing the gap would raise the US GDP by 5%, Japan by 9% and Egypt by 34% [[10](#ref_10)]. \n\nWe can clearly see the gap in [Figure_7](#figure_7).

[Figure_12](#figure_12) shows the SWOT matrix for all three income groups. All groups suffer from large gender gap (weakness). This could lead to a lot of gender biases because females point of view is not being taken into consideration (threat). Also, accross all three groups, women are more likely to have an advanced degree such as a masters or a PhD(strength). This presents an opportunity and it is very likely that encouraging initiatives to close the salary gap can lead to more female graduates and hires.","d6bc4b9c":"Let's see what each income group is made of.

In upper-middle income countries, database engineers earn the highest salary with an average of \\$40K yearly followed by data engineers who earn \\$35K a year. It is interesting to note that while upper-middle countries have higher salaries than lower-middle income countries, product\/project managers earn more in lower-middle income countries than their counterparts in upper-middle income countries.
