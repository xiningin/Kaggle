This means that maybe they pursue their studies and obtain their masters at a further point in time.\n* 2. In many countries in Africa, the children have to start providing financilly sooner rather than later.

Throught its speakers and poster sessions, it also provides a platform to highlight the unbelievable achievements of African researchers \/ students \/ startups.\n\nMore than 500 Africans gathered for the second edition of this event. As for the speakers, we were served by *La creme de la creme* : Moustapha Cisse, Timnit Gebru, Nando De Freitas, Jeff Dean and many other big names were there to inspire and empower the community.    \n\nOn a personnal note, not only did I have the great honour of talking to world-renowned scientists of our field, especially those who are born, raised and educated in Africa, but I also had the pleasure of exchanging with peers I so rarely meet and discuss their posters that was showcasing the amazing research work that African universities have been able to deliver as of late [1].\n\nYou can find some blog posts where attendants talk in more details about their experiences there and why the enjoyed it [2].","4ed61bcf":"And believe me when I say this : many, many africans have similar stories to this one above and it's been amazing to see the efforts that are being made from the AI community to build a diverse and inclusive environment where anyone that puts in the workd could thrive.\n\nI stated before that many universities in Africa still don't include ML in their teaching. I also discussed that quality of teaching can also be a concern sometimes. This is changing now, and part of that is because of the newly founded masters AMMI, let's talk about that.","640e2036":"![google](https:\/\/www.newsghana.com.gh\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/google-1.jpg)","8048f67a":"Here each respondent is asked for how long he's been using ML. The trend in Africa and the rest of the world is similar (highest percentage in < 2 years).  That being said, respondents from Africa seem to be even newer to ML, as seen in the plot.\n\nLet's see what happens when we go to the workplace : ","07c31931":"We notice that most of the African respondents are between 22 and 24 while the majority for the rest of the world falls under the 25-29 category.                                        \nNoticing this trend, it made me think about an important point : **The youth of Africa**.       \nHere's an anecdote that's been told to me : Moustapha Cisse, who's 33 and is from Senegal, is older than 70% of the population of Senegal. Kyunghyun Cho, who's 34 and is from Korea, is younger over 70% of the population in Korea [3].                          \nIn fact, to give you a more general view, **the median age in Africa is 19; in the European Union, 43.** Yep, the difference is that huge and the margin of progress is that big for Africa.","c9c7ce97":"Most respondents haven't started working yet. The others work mainly in tech or education\/academia.     \n\nI would like to focus on that small fraction that's categorized under \"Non-profit\/Service\". It's only 2.7%, granted. It's still 3 times the value found in the rest of the world (0.8%). In fact, more and more \"AI for good\" projects are taking place in Africa because there's an increasing sense of urgency when thinking about the effect that AI\/ML can actually have regarding the problems facing Africa.\n\nExamples of such work include : \n* Delta Analytics, provides talks and live teaching classes in different countries (among other activies such as consulting to NGOs) [5].\n* AI Saturday Lagos, provides a weekly meetup community that gathers to learn, follow fast.ai courses, organize ML hackathons ...","b40f5b27":"Bear in mind that in this question, respondents could have multiple choices (so probably a lot of people that checked self-taught also checked online courses).        \nMore than half the respondents consider themself to be self-taught while only 30% consider that University played a role in their teaching. That's not surprising since many universities in Africa are just starting to include ML courses in their curriculum. \n\nWhich platforms are mainly used for online learning ? ","a7999b47":"# Conclusion\n<a id=\"conclusion\"><\/a>\n*** \n\nThis is maybe the most important part of my notebook, so I hope you're still not bored ! \n\nIn this notebook, I wanted to show that the future of AI in Africa seems bright. Indeed, unlike past technological revolutions, mutiple efforts are being done to ensure that Africa can thrive : from companies sponsoring events such as Deep Learning Indaba to opening research labs in Africa. In fact, even the most important ML-related conferences will be happening in Africa in the next few years. **Indeed, ICLR, a major AI conference, will take place in Addis, Ethiopia, in 2020 !**[11]    \nIt's also necessary to recognize the work of a handful of people who worked extremely hard to get to this point, to name a few : \n*  **Moustapha Ciss\u00e9**, that I've mentionned before, used his position to push for the Google AI Lab in Accra (which he'll lead) and founded the AMMI.\n* **Rediet Abebe and Timnit Gebry** founded the 'Black in AI' group that aims to increase increase the presence of Black people in the field of Artificial Intelligence and the work they've been doing is HUGE, to name a few :  financial assistance for members who want to attend conferences, mentoring for students who are applying for graduate programs. \n* One could also cite **Yoshua Bengio** and the founders of fast.ai, **Jeremy Howard and Rachel Thomas**, who have been using their platform and their voice to encourage diversity and explain why it's not a bonus but a necessity. \n\nAll of that being said, everything is not perfect. Let's take this survey for example : Less than 5% of the respondents are actually from Africa. That's far too few. As many of you may know, NeurIPS is taking place in Montreal this week. **Guess how many African scientists, members of the black in AI group, have been denied a Visa to Canada ? Half of them**. Yes, that's a crazy number... PhD students in Oxford and even research scientists from Google didn't get a Visa on time. This goes on to show how difficult it can be for an African scientist to thrive and present their work, for absolutely no other reason than pure racial profiling.[12]          \nLack of diversity and representation can also cause AI to be racist\/sexist as shown in many research papers (example of facial recognition algorithms algorithms which are less accurate when it comes to black people)[7,8].  If teams that set research directions and write algorithms or are made up of individuals from similar backgrounds and experiences, then we will end up with research that is to the benefit of a similarly narrow and already privileged subset of society [9].\nEstablishing a diverse and inclusive environment will take time and efforts for any and each one of us. The first step is to encourage AI education and incentivize entrepreneurship in the AI sector across the continent [10].\n\nTo conclude, I'd like to send one last message to fellow students from minorities that \n\nWhen attending an event where you can meet and talk with African scientists that made it to the top, such as Deep Learning Indaba,  it gives you a much needed confidence boost. I'll share an anecdote that marked me : I had a long exchange with [Nando de Freitas](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nando_de_Freitas) on the closing night as I was trying to get some advices from him, at one point he said : \"When I was your age, I was doing my masters at University of the Witwatersrand (South Africa) and a couple of mathematicians were coming from Imperial College to our university. I was like *Oh wow those people are unbelieavble, I can't even talk to them at my level*  and then I went to one of them and started discussing an idea that was in one of his papers. At that specific point, I realized that it was all in my head, there was no reason for me to feel inferior because I'm not.\"      \nBeing part of an underrepresented minority \/ coming from a country without world class universities, the lack in confidence is quite natural. But at the end of that week, everyone was pumped and motivated because literally every lecturer's\/guest's message was **\"I've been in the exact same spot. I felt that I won't be admitted to that PhD. I won't be admitted to that Internship and yet, here I am. If you work hard enough, if you put in the work there's no reason for you not to reach your goal, no matter your race or your country\"**. I know this might sound very clich\u00e9, but it was very effective because indeed, every one of them went through it.\n\nI hope that this hybrid  blog post\/notebook will be helpful to people in any way.\n\n[Masakhane !](https:\/\/www.wordnik.com\/words\/Masakhane)","e9eab577":"It seems that women tend to go for the Master's \/ PhD more often than men. This could be because one of the following, or a bit of each : \n1. The male is still considered as the provider in many countries in Africa. So the \"urgency\" of working is a little bit more present for the male.\n2.

A special event \"Women in ML\" was organized by Microsoft in order to encourage, support and unite women in machine learning, while highlighting diverse career paths: from academia, to industrial research, to applied machine learning, and start-ups. \n\nI think that similar efforts are a great way to help women thrive and feel empowered in a field that is so dominated by the male presence.","0fafce02":"# Table of contents\n***\n\n* [Deep Learning Indaba ](#introduction)\n\n* [1.

Ever since, I was wondering what would be the best way for me to share that experience and share my thoughts about the state of AI in Africa in general in order to : \n1. Reach out to Africans, especially students like me, who have their doubts, struggle to fit and show them that they're far from being alone in their quest.\n2. Reach out to the rest of the world and raise awareness of the potential in Africa and the importance of its inclusion in research and in representation.\n\nMedium has been THE to-go place for such blogs but this survey  gave me an original and fun way to tell my story. \n\nIn this notebook, I will be talking about **AI in Africa**. More specifically, I will talk about the main efforts that are being done to help close the gap and promote AI (Deep Learning Indaba, Black in AI, new google research lab in Ghana...) and while doing that, I'll be using some extracts from the Kaggle Survey that will shed more lights on this matter.","ad0d541a":"Coursera comes first, as expected. Many other platforms are starting to put together great resources for ML and AI and it shows on the graph : there's no monopoly when it comes to the platforms.\n\nWhat about how efficient those platforms are compared to university ? Let's check for students from Africa and the rest of the world."}}
