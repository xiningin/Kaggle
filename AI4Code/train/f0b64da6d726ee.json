Art was to exist for its own sake, for its own essence or beauty.\"\n\n\"The artist was NOT to BE CONCERNED about morality or UTILITY or even THE PLEASURE THAT a WORK might BRING to its AUDIENCE. Aestheticism was supported in Germany by J. W. von Goethe and in England by Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Thomas Carlyle.\"\n\n\"Oscar Wilde did not invent Aestheticism, but he was a dramatic leader in promoting the movement near the end of the nineteenth century.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/www.cliffsnotes.com\/literature\/p\/the-picture-of-dorian-gray\/critical-essays\/oscar-wildes-aesthetics","ac247480":"<h1><span class=\"label label-default\" style=\"background-color:black;border-radius:100px 100px; font-weight: bold; font-family:Garamond; font-size:20px; color:#03e8fc; padding:10px\">Dorian Gray Deep Learning<\/span><\/h1><br>\n\n\"In The Picture of Dorian Gray, the perception of appearance and sin is delicately interwoven. Connecting the beauty of Dorian with the rumors of his corruption, we are able to witness an exploration of aestheticism and see a hint of its flaws, especially in regards to perceiving PEOPLE as ART OBJECTS, as what can be lost in judging people in such a way. Each line reveals to us a DEEPER LAYER of the society, perception, and beliefs of the culture painted in Dorian Gray.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/milesofpagesblog.wordpress.com\/2019\/03\/11\/the-appearance-of-sin\/"}}
