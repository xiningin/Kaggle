So is there truly a correlation between sex and heart disease? Well, I can't really accept this result here mainly for one reason. The data for healthy female is too low. We only have 24 female individuals that are healthy. If we were to push the number up to, let's say 94, we will get a much higher p-value.

People who are suffering from heart diseases are known to demonstrate high blood pressure, lipids, glucose as well as obesity and overweight issues. The ability to identify these high risk factors will ensure that the patients receieve appropriate medical care and prevent premature deaths. \n\n## Understanding this study\nWe have the following information about our dataset:\n- Age\n- Sex: (1 = Male, 0 = Female)\n- cp(chest pain type): \n    * 1 = typical angina\n    * 2 = atypical angina\n    * 3 = non-anginal pain \n    * 4 = asymptomatic\n- trestbps: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)\n- chol: Serum cholestoral in mg\/dl\n- fbs: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg\/dl (1 = true; 0 = false)\n- restecg: Resting electrocardiographic results\n    * 0: Normal\n    * 1: Having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and\/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)\n    * 2: Showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria\n- thalach: Maximum heart rate achieved \n- exang: Exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)\n- oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest\n- slope: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment\n    * 1: Upsloping\n    * 2: Flat\n    * 3: Downsloping\n- ca: Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy\n- thal: Thalium heart scan\n    * 3: Normal\n    * 6: Fixed defect\n    * 7: Reversable defect\n- target: Diagnosis of heart disease\n    * 1: Yes\n    * 0: No\n    \n## Objective\n- Find any correlations between attributes\n- Find correlations between each attribute and the diagnosis of heart disease","312620b2":"# Correlation between fasting blood sugar and heart disease ","b7deb827":"# Correlation between serum cholesterol and heart disease","adfa2290":"Looking good! We do know that some of the attributes like sex, slope, target have numbers denoting their categorical attributes. We will need to change them to something we can understand without looking back.

Not really for this case. We do see an even distribution of heart disease patients across all ages. In fact we even saw a positive correlation between age and healthy patients.
