We will reduce all 784 pixel features to 2 features and compare the impact it has on the accuracy score. For dimensionality reduction we first use [Truncated Singular Value Decomposition (TSVD)](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Singular_value_decomposition), which is a powerful compression algorithm for matrices such as MNIST digit images. After that we use [t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/T-distributed_stochastic_neighbor_embedding) on the compressed data from TSVD. Luckily we can easily implement these algorithms thanks to libraries such as [scikit-learn](https:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/). Let's dive in!\n\nImage: an example of t-SNE results on the MNIST dataset with labels. In this kernel we will create our own t-SNE visualization.

I will try to implement your suggestions in this kernel!","fa4e5315":"Besides compressing data and making simple algorithms more effective on high-dimensional data, t-SNE can also be used to create intuitive and beautiful visualizations of data. As you can see in the graph below the classes are clearly distinct from each other when compressed into a 2-dimensional space. Also, images that are similar like 3 and 9 are closer to each other than 0 and 7. In the MNIST dataset, some 7's look pretty much like a 1 and this is reflected in the t-SNE visualization.\n\nA downside of creating a classifiers using compressed data can be that a model like a decision tree becomes less interpretable. We don't know which specific feature influences the result because all features are made up of a combination of features. We can counter this by compressing groups of features that have a similar meaning and have a high correlation with each other.","8aa83fd8":"The general metric for MNIST is a simple accuracy score. We use [sklearn's accuracy_score](https:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/generated\/sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score.html) straight out of the box for measuring performance.
