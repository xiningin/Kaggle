`ImageClassificationBase` class whose functions are:**\n\n- `training_step` - To figure out how \u201cwrong\u201d the model is going after training or validation step.We are using this function other than just an accuracy metric that is likely not going to be differentiable (this would mean that the gradient can\u2019t be determined, which is necessary for the model to improve during training)\n\nA quick look at the PyTorch docs that yields the cost function: [cross_entropy](https:\/\/pytorch.org\/docs\/stable\/nn.functional.html#cross-entropy).\n\n- `validation_step` - Because an accuracy metric can\u2019t be used while training the model, doesn\u2019t mean it shouldn\u2019t be implemented! Accuracy in this case would be measured by a threshold, and counted if the difference between the model\u2019s prediction and the actual label is lower than that threshold.\n- `validation_epoch_end` - We want to track the validation losses\/accuracies and train losses after each epoch, and every time we do so we have to make sure the gradient is not being tracked.\n- `epoch_end` - We also want to print validation losses\/accuracies, train losses and learning rate too because we are using learning rate scheduler (which will change the learning rate after every batch of training) after each epoch.\n\nWe also define an `accuracy` function which calculates the overall accuracy of the model on an entire batch of outputs, so that we can use it as a metric in `fit_one_cycle`","c923ea3d":"Before we train the model, Let\u2019s define a utility functionan `evaluate` function, which will perform the validation phase, and a `fit_one_cycle` function which will perform the entire training process.

Saving a model in this way will save the entire module using Python\u2019s [pickle](https:\/\/docs.python.org\/3\/library\/pickle.html) module. The disadvantage of this approach is that the serialized data is bound to the specific classes and the exact directory structure used when the model is saved. The reason for this is because pickle does not save the model class itself. Rather, it saves a path to the file containing the class, which is used during load time. Because of this, your code can break in various ways when used in other projects or after refactors.","fd2ae0b2":"\n#### Hope you all learned something from this kernel.

There are many strategies for varying the learning rate during training, and the one we\u2019ll use is called the *\u201cOne Cycle Learning Rate Policy\u201d*, which involves starting with a low learning rate, gradually increasing it batch-by-batch to a high learning rate for about 30% of epochs, then gradually decreasing it to a very low value for the remaining epochs.\n\n- **Weight Decay**: We also use weight decay, which is a regularization technique which prevents the weights from becoming too large by adding an additional term to the loss function. \n\n- **Gradient Clipping**: Apart from the layer weights and outputs, it also helpful to limit the values of gradients to a small range to prevent undesirable changes in parameters due to large gradient values. This simple yet effective technique is called gradient clipping.\n\nWe'll also record the learning rate used for each batch.","264d59ae":"`torchvision.datasets` is a class which helps in loading all common and famous datasets.
