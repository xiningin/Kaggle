But she wants to focus her attention on articles including a specific word. Complete the function below to help her filter her list of articles.\n\nYour function should meet the following criteria\n\n- Do not include documents where the keyword string shows up only as a part of a larger word. For example, if she were looking for the keyword \u201cclosed\u201d, you would not include the string \u201cenclosed.\u201d \n- She does not want you to distinguish upper case from lower case letters. So the phrase \u201cClosed the case.\u201d would be included when the keyword is \u201cclosed\u201d\n- Do not let periods or commas affect what is matched. \u201cIt is closed.\u201d would be included when the keyword is \u201cclosed\u201d. But you can assume there are no other types of punctuation.","932bea43":"## 0. \n\nLet's start with a string lightning round to warm up.

Use the variable `length` to record your answer, then run the cell to check whether you were right.","bae919e4":"## 3.\n\nNow the researcher wants to supply multiple keywords to search for.

For our purposes, a valid zip code is any string consisting of exactly 5 digits.\n\nHINT: `str` has a method that will be useful here. Use `help(str)` to review a list of string methods."}}
