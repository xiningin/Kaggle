For this evaluation metrics like accuracy, metrics which consider unfair bias are considered.<br>\n4) There are challenges as well which data scientists face in initiating the machine learning project like finding and collecting data. Mostly data scientists try to find data on publically available platforms like Kaggle, Github, etc and some try to collect the data on their own.<br>\n5) While collecting data, one should consider the biased target problem and the analysis needs to communicate with the data collector in order to generate best data and find best insights from them.<br>\n6) Bt the job is not done here only. Data scientists needs to check the model insights as well. They can check either while building the AI model or before putting the model into production as this notebook's analysis explains.<br><br>\n\n**Experience**<br><br>\n1) As most of the developers are students so does their experience graph depicts. Most of the respondents have\n    experience less than 5 years.<br>\n    \n**Salary**<br>\n1) Average salary of Developers lie between 0-20K USD\n\n### Hope the above analysis helps to get to know about the Data Science Career.\n### Thank You!","829510f4":"1) As analysed earlier, People mostly use Python or R as their programming language.<br>\n2) Sql, c++ are also among the widely used languages.<br>\n3) Python, Typescript are the specific languages which people use.","dace2126":"### <a id=\"5\">5.
