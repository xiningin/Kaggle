This happens because developing apps in the Android Studio is one of the most discussed things online and you can find solutions for literally everything. Furthermore, for a non-programmer's case, there are plenty of programs to create applications for Android using simplified programming language, in a much more accessible way for the developer and there are even more programs which use a graphical environment, without the need of coding! <\/font>\n**<br><br><font size=3>Then, what does it take for an android app to be considered successful?<\/font><br><br>**\n<font size=3>First of all, what the word successful actually means? An Android application would be characterized as successful if it has an amount greater than a hundred thousand downloads. When the application is ready and uploaded on Play Store, advertisement is the primary factor for a successful application.<\/font>\n**<br><br><font size=3>But, what should we take into account before the application is completed?<\/font><br><br>**\n <font size=3>Here is where a Data Scientist comes! Having a large amount of application data of Play Store can be very usefull to analyse why and how some applications succeed and others do not. So, the \"Google Play Store App\" dataset is a very good start to enable you to see things you may have to add or remove in your current developing Android application!
