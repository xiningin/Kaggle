Bar plot**\n* A bar plot represents the category of data with rectangular bars with height which represents the value.\n* Bars can be plotted virtically of horizontally.\n* Bar charts describe the comparisons between discrete categories. \n","5a542bfc":"# Visualizing planet data using seaborn","971baaff":"**9. Scatterplot**\n* Scatter plots are used to find the relationship between the variables.","47b477a6":"**10. Heatmap**\n* Heatmap is a representation of data in the form of a map or diagram in which data values are represented as colours.","6bd3682a":"**6. Swarm plot**\n* It is a good complement to a box or violin plot when we  want to show all observations along with some representation of the underlying distribution.","9c23c73f":"**5. Violin plot**\n* It is similar to a box plot, with the addition of a rotated kernel density plot on each side.","460ea121":"**Conclusion**\nVisualization is great way to communicate.

Selection of plot depends on our objective. \n\nThanks for reading!!!","62642e9a":"![featured-data-visualization.png](attachment:featured-data-visualization.png)","ba178aa8":"**3.

Catplot**\n* Catplot shows the frequencies of the categories of categorical variables.","80304cc5":"Graphical way of representing data is termed as visualization. It is obvious that we all like seeing graphs\/pictures rather than reading text data. There are numerous way of communicating through visualizing our data. \nLet's make an attempt to understand various plots along with their description. \n\nHere we go!!!!!!","542c8bc9":"**4. Box plot**\n* Boxplot represents the quantiles of the data. \n* This method is used for outlier detection. \n* This plot represents min,max and quantiles.","ffd40bd2":"**2.
