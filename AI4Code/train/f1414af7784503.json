What is the most dreaded language for \"Data or business analyst\"\n> 2. What is the most dreaded language for \"I am not primarily a developer, but I write code sometimes as part of my work\"?\n>\n> The reason I ask these questions is to me it is totally obvious that a full stack\/back end\/desktop application\/front end developer wouldn't want to use VBA. They have much better tools at their disposal. The important question really is, how is VBA rated where it's most used, imo.\n\n","1b21fb73":"## Q0: What percentage of VBA developers did not express interest in continuing with VBA?\n\nThis question is not listed above.\n\nThe purpose of this question is to whether or not the way we got the data from the CSV file is correct. Stack Overflow already provided the answer (80.4%). We need to be able to arrive at the same number.\n\nSo far, what we have done is to read from the source data, store each response in a `dataclass`, and collect all responses in a `list`.\n","658c48b6":"# Where do we go from here?\n\nAs an accountant who works with VBA a LOT but doesn't really have much collaboration with other people, it is personally meaningful to me to have an idea of what other VBA coders are like. To be honest, VBA being the most dreaded language is not something I would be surprised to discover.\n\nSome final thoughts for anyone who would like to improve this notebook\n\n- There are other variables in the survey which wasn't taken into account in this notebook.\n    * To add other data, just add attributes to the `Respondent` dataclass, or try `setattr()`.\n- This notebook could also use some visualization.\n- Set `LANG` to a different language to use the code for a different language.\n\n## Functions\n- Function `create_counter()`: the first argument must be a string which exists as an attribute of the `Respondent` dataclass. The second argument must be an iterable containing `Respondent` objects.\n- Function `print_counter_results()`: pass a `Counter` object as first argument; optional argument `top` limits printed results based on given integer. This function could definitely use some improvements especially with regards to `string` and `print`.","e76cfb9d":"# Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2020\n\nThis is inspired by Corey Schafer's video [Python Data Science Tutorial: Analyzing the 2019 Stack Overflow Developer Survey](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=_P7X8tMplsw) where he performed basic analysis of Stack Overflow survey results without using `pandas`.\n\nIn this notebook, we will answer the question, **Who are VBA Developers?**\n\nAccording to [Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2020](https:\/\/insights.stackoverflow.com\/survey\/2020#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-languages-dreaded), 80.4% of developers who are developing with Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) have not expressed interest in continuing to do so. This makes VBA the Most Dreaded Language for two years in a row.\n\nIn particular, I'm interested knowing about the following:\n\n1. Other than VBA, what languages have they worked with in the past year (`LanguageWorkedWith`)?\n1. What languages do they desire to work with next year (`LanguageDesireNextYear`)?\n1. How frequently do VBA developers learn a new language or framework (`NEWLearn`)?\n1. Primary operating system (`OpSys`)?\n1. What kind of developer are they (`DevType`)?\n1. How do they best describe themselves (`MainBranch`)?\n1. Where do they live (`Country`)?\n1. How do they describe their employment status (`Employment`)?\n1. How many years have they been coding in total (`YearsCode`)?\n1. What is their primary field of study (`UndergradMajor`)?\n"}}
