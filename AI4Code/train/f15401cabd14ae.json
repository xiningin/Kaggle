In the future I hope to do something more extensive in this area. But for now, maybe think twice about buying a new iPhone to \"fix\" a broken screen or buying one every year? :P\n\nIn all seriousness though, the final section of this notebook was meant to explore why Indian's choose to immigrate abroad. This was meant to include an analysis of loan repayment options an why Indians have certain advantages over native citizens.\n\nEmprically, Indians have three main advantages. On average, they are younger than native citizens when they enter postgraduate programs (Indians finish school at 16-17 at least 1 year earlier than American children). Second, Indians do not have massive undergraduate loans to worry about that amount to tens of thousands of dollars. This is their biggest advantage over Americans because it means that they can pay off their loans faster than Americans who need to reconcile the constrasting perspectives of more dollars in loans and a better salary. Many choose to stay content with just  undergraduate degree because of this (which is what I wanted to explore in the last part of the notebook). Given that they are younger and have more time left in their careers, this effect often balloons. Finally, Indians are used to a lower standard of living than their American peers. Many of the things that seem ordinary to Americans are luxuries that Indians are able to live without while they wrap up their loans.\n\nAgain emprically, the flip-side to this is the risk involved for Indians. Coming back to India without paying off your student loans is a bad place to be in. Given that the salary is about a tenth of what you would earn in the USA (this number was taken from this dataset), you are looking at a significantly longer repayment schedule in India especially once you consider living costs.","b60779d8":"### Annex B:","801aa1a1":"### A sample comparison of buying power\n\nThe graphs below show sample costs for a variety of products.

These comparisons go beyond simple life and even into grander opportunities.\n\nThink about international flights, gadgets, etc. Chances are prices don't change significantly across geographies unless there are a large fraction of manual labour involved - at which point, cost of labor factors into price.

While comparing different countries, I have made no attempt to include tax calculations. This is largely because tax deductions are varied and depend on the special circumstances of each person. It is more straightforward to include.\n\n2. I have included only Data Scientists for this analyis. However, Data Scientists only account for about 15-20% of the survey respondents. The reason I stuck with the choice is in part due to my desire for consistency (with the title and the comical aspect of the data analyis) but also because I did not want to involve more career paths that have smaller and differing levels of interaction with Data Science.\n\n3. I have only accounted for Bachelor, Master, and Doctrate programs. This is because these are the traditional paths available to Indian students who want to work abroad. Including the remaining would not be a fair comparison because there is no way that bridge or cross-over for comparison. You do not have a drop out from India going and working for a FAANG company in USA. Likewise, given the intense compeition,  it is unlikely for plain cetrificate holders to work in the USA. Remote work is an option, one that even I have taken advantage of, but the opportunity is very niche.\n\n4. I have made use of percentages for buying power comparisons because it is the most straightforward way for someone to understand the extent of strength or weakness in their local currency. PPP (Purchasing Power Parity is a similar concept, but I wanted to show how it may not be an entirely accurate measure. Sadly I was not able to get the required data, that would allow me to check if raw material prices at the industrial level do not change depending on the country buying. \n\n5. All additional data was gathered manually. I have explained further in the dataset description ([link](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/aashishghosh\/iphone-prices-and-average-rent-across-the-world)). Data was collected from three sites: www.themacindex.com, www.numbeo.com and www.globalpetrolprices.com. Global petrol prices had a special CC (CC Attribution Noncommercial No derivs) license and I clarified this use case (kaggle competition) via email with the owners of the data.\n\n6. The low number of responses makes it hard to make definite statements regarding the industry and the world. The best I can personally hope for is something along the lines of: \"Look, this is how _this data_ is spread\". However, the general intuition regarding PPP is what I wanted to demonstrate the most, and I think I have succeeded there.\n\n7. I wish I could delve deeper into data that would allow me to analyse immigration from India and the motivations to do so. I suppose this will need to wait for more data. This is of personal interest to me because I wonder if understanding how to remove this income disparity holds the key to removing income disparities all over the world, including countries with strong economic power. Some of these countries still have extremely poor people and large disparities in income.","b8dd2dd8":"UAE has an interesting value for rent\/income.\n\nThe value is of the ratio is **close to 1** indicating that:\n1. the value of rent is wrong and is biased by higher earners (or)\n2. the value of salary has been biased by younger members of society who do not earn money (or)\n3. people with lower incomes tend to share their homes\/rooms with others (or)\n4.
