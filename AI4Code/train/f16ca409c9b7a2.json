This accuracy is calculated on the same data on which the model is trained. Now let's see the accuracy when our model gets new data on which it is not trained. Generally it should be slightly lower than the training accuracy.<br>\n> This is done to avoid overfitting. **Overfitting** is the case when the model gives *high accuracy on training data but low accuracy on test data*. Whenever you see a hugh difference in the Train accuracy and Validation accuracy, it is an example of overfitting. \nOverfitting can be caused due to a number of reasons and have several ways to avoid and fix. We will discuss that later in the course.<br>\n*Note that we expect the validation accuracy to be slightly lower than training accuracy but not much lower.*","8d4dc6a9":"# Preprocess\n\nThe image pixels in the data range from 0-255.

It depends on a number of factors like size of data and complexity of classification, etc.* You will slowly get a feeling of how to estimate number of epochs required for a particular model and dataset.","78f540b5":"# Modelling\n\nThere are two types of models in Tensorflow:\n - **Sequential**\n - **Graphical**\n\n## Models\n`tf.keras.model.Sequential()` lets you create a linear stack of layers providing a Sequential netural network.<br>\n`tf.model()` allows you to create arbitarary graph of layers as long as there is no cycle.\n\n## Flatten Layer\n`tf.keras.layes.Flatten()` flattens the input.<br>\nFor input of `(batch_size, height, width)` the output converts to `(batch_size, height*width)`\n\n## Dense Layer\n`tf.keras.layers.Dense()` Normal dense layer of Neural Network where each node is connected to each node in the next layer. <br>\n>The two arguments passes below in dense layer are *units* and *activation* (activation function).<br>\n* **units** corresponds to the number of nodes in the layer<br>\n* **activation** is an element-wise activation function.\n    * **relu**: This activation function converts every negative value to 0 and positive remains the same\n    * **softmax**: This function takes the element with max value, converts it into 1 and rest to 0.\n\nIn the below example we've 3 dense layers with 128, 64 and 10 nodes respectively. The layer with 10 nodes is supposed to be the output layer. Since we just need single value as 1 (preferably the maximum value), therefore we apply *softmax* activation function to the final\/output layer.\n\n## Compiling model\n`model.compile()` Sets up the optimiser, loss and metrics configuration.\n> * **optimizer**: updates the parameter of the Neural Network.\n* **loss**: Measures the error in our model.\n* **metrics**: Used to judge the model. The difference between metrics and loss is that metrics in not used to evaluate the model while training, whereas loss evaluates the model error while training and helps optimizer reduce the error.","85dfc127":"# Tensorflow Keras Tutorial - Neural Network (Part 1)\n\n**What is Keras?** Keras is a wrapper that allows you to implement Deep Neural Network without getting into intrinsic details of the Network.

You set a large number of epochs but most likely after it reaches the required accuracy it will go on training resuling into overfitting. So you just need the training to stop when it reaches to 95%. Let's see how we can do that."}}
