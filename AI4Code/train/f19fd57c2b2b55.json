","351f9d37":"Following our analysis of the weather data, I decided to investigate if time of day has an effect on both accident severity and the number of accidents.","62bf889e":"From checking my calendar, I was able to see that the peaks and dips corresponding to weekdays and weekends respectively. This makes sense as less people tend to travel on the weekend and perhaps drivers are in less of a rush to get to work. If we zoom in further, perhaps we can see this better.","00818faa":"Let's see if it worked.","ba040ef1":"### Part 5: Correlation","6c322bb7":"Below I've grouped the number of accidents that occur each day by their Severity.","32868514":"I began by converting the relevant columns to the correct datatype. ","323947ec":"### Part One - Data Preparation and Cleaning","4b57206c":"- The analysis of a large set of data takes some extensive pre-planning as it's quite easy to get lost amongst all the potential questions. I decided that by pre-planning my questions and objectives, I was able to meet the majority of my goals within the timeframe.\n\n\n- Sometimes the results were surprising because you expect clearer correlations between bad weather and the number of accidents. However, it's worth noting that the occurence of bad weather is typically less common than good weather, depending on which state you're in. Factors such as population density, road useage, road conditions and the numbers of drivers per state could have significant impacts on the number of accidents that occur.\n\n\n- Giving advice based on data can be difficult given that even accident reporting can be subjective without a clear understanding of the system utilised. For example, the lack of Severity 1 accidents suggests that there's probably an unreporting of more minor accidents, whilst the abundance of Severity 2 accidents suggest that perhaps those that report accidents may only report them if they feel they're worth it and bump them up a category.\n\n\n- Despite this, analysing data for trends over time is quite interesting. In the aforementioned severity vs time plot, it's plain to see where weekends and weekdays have an impact on the number of accidents, likely due to the changes in the numbers of road users. Also, it's apparent when public holidays occur such as Christmas, there are significantly less accidents.","9d9b6898":"Hypothesis can be rejected","574529d5":"This rather spikey graph illustrates the number of accidents against the timeframe we are investigating, catagorised by the severity. \n\nAs you can see from the above plot, the greatest number of accidents are considered Severity 2, followed by Severity 3 and 4. There are barely any Severity 1 accidents, as this suggests that perhaps the definition of an accident isn't always clear and perhaps many are unreported.\n\nHere, I zoom in on a smaller timeframe to investigate the nature of the peaks and troughs.

","478b5629":"Whilst given that this is an accident dataset and that the most common description of the accident is \"(Q) Accident(s)\" is unsurprising, it's interesting to denote the use of the TMC as a way of providing quick information the to Police, Emergency Services etc. It also gives valuable traffic data in some instances such as how the road is affected.","b4634c45":"Here, I convert the entire Start Time column to a datatime format.

","7f05d54d":"As we stipulated, around 8pm and 5pm, the greatest number of accidents occurs. We can attribute this perhaps to rush hour.

It then prints the correlation between the weather condition and Severity.","d319df37":"#### As you can see above, Severity 4 accidents occur most frequently in Flordia, Georgia and California."}}
