Let's make at a plot.","a10532fd":"## Background\nSARIMA and exponential smoothing (Holt Winters) are proven to work well for a range of time series prediction problems, but they require a good bit of parameter tuning. \n\nProphet is a relatively new library -  it was released in 2017. It's designed for \"Business Time Series\".  Prophet is open source and was developed by Facebook. Facebook claims to use it a good deal internally. It is useful for univariate prediction. Prophet has APIs for Python and R. It is designed to be robust to use and to handle seasonal trends and holidays well. \n\nProphet uses a generalized additive model, a type of regression model, to make predictions. It can accomodate non-linear smoothers applied ot the regressors. The model is decomposable into trend, seasonality, and holiday components. Prophet is curve-fitting instead of a model class like ARIMA that explicitly accounts for the temporal component of the model through autoregression. \n\nProphet can accomodate expert information, so it's Bayesian-friendly.\n\nProphet is fast and the [Prohpet docs](https:\/\/facebook.github.io\/prophet\/docs\/quick_start.html) are quite nice. Here's an [introductory paper](https:\/\/peerj.com\/preprints\/3190\/) on the library. \n\nI've only found two evaluations of Prophet. One, discussed [here],(http:\/\/kourentzes.com\/forecasting\/2017\/07\/29\/benchmarking-facebooks-prophet\/) found it didn't perform fabulously with a relatively small amout of data, which isn't shocking. A [second analysis](https:\/\/pythondata.com\/stock-market-forecasting-with-prophet\/) of stock data also didn't find it to perform super well.\n\nWe're going to test it on smaller and larger data sets for business-case type problems.","54c7b5df":"That all looks correct.","8bdcd6bc":"## Performance metrics\n\nLet's compare the predictions to the actual values from the first forecast, when the fourier_term was higher and nothing was log transformed. \n\nWe first need to create a cutoff column so Prophet knows when to compare predicted values to actual values.","1a07cc98":"That looks better.","85140583":"Let's decompose this graph into the trend and seasonality.

We'll do that in a bit.","c6a1d250":"Let's plot the RMSE lines for the two models. I chose RMSE because its a common metric that outputs an error term in the same units as the predicted variable.
