Save the results to a variable called `predictions`.","d3673472":"## Step 2: Create X\nNow you will create a DataFrame called `X` holding the predictive features.\n\nSince you want only some columns from the original data, you'll first create a list with the names of the columns you want in `X`.\n\nYou'll use just the following columns in the list (you can copy and paste the whole list to save some typing, though you'll still need to add quotes):\n    * LotArea\n    * YearBuilt\n    * 1stFlrSF\n    * 2ndFlrSF\n    * FullBath\n    * BedroomAbvGr\n    * TotRmsAbvGrd\n\nAfter you've created that list of features, use it to create the DataFrame that you'll use to fit the model.","3503eed2":"# Exercises\n\n## Step 1: Specify Prediction Target\nSelect the target variable, which corresponds to the sales price. Save this to a new variable called `y`. You'll need to print a list of the columns to find the name of the column you need.\n"}}
