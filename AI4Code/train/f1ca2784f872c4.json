There are a lot of components: exploring the training data, training different models, combining trained models in different combinations (ensembling), and so on.\n\n\nW&B can be useful for Kaggle competition with it's lightweight and interoperable tools:\n\n* Quickly track experiments,\n* Version and iterate on datasets,\n* Evaluate model performance,\n* Reproduce models,\n* Visualize results and spot regressions,\n* Share findings with colleagues.\n\nTo learn more about Weights and Biases check out this [kernel](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/ayuraj\/experiment-tracking-with-weights-and-biases).","21862dd3":"## \ud83d\udd251 FastAI\ud83d\udd25\n\n![image.png](attachment:f84bbc1e-80d7-4e05-9f91-d620d744b270.png)\n\n* No 998\n* easy to use\n\n\n### Architecture\n\n![](https:\/\/docs.fast.ai\/images\/layered.png)\n\n\n### The component will be used\n\n1. learner\n2.
