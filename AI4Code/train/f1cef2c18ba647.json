Thus I have decided to share with you how you can build a custom Convolutional Neural Network estimator, train it, evaluate its performance and submit predictions.\n\n## Estimator API\n\nLet's start by exploring the [documentation](https:\/\/www.tensorflow.org\/guide\/estimators) (optional). So an Estimator is simply a python object which already has the following methods defined:\n* train\n* evaluate\n* predict\n\nand the only thing which you need to do is to serve your data into those methods via an **input function**.\n\nNow here is the place to mention that it is this simple only for premade (canned) estimators, where the structure of the neural network had been defined. Examples for such estimators are:\n* [DNN Classifier](https:\/\/www.tensorflow.org\/api_docs\/python\/tf\/estimator\/DNNClassifier)\n* [DNN Regressor](https:\/\/www.tensorflow.org\/api_docs\/python\/tf\/estimator\/DNNRegressor)\n* [Boosted Trees Classifier](https:\/\/www.tensorflow.org\/api_docs\/python\/tf\/estimator\/BoostedTreesClassifier)\n* [Boosted Trees Regressor](https:\/\/www.tensorflow.org\/api_docs\/python\/tf\/estimator\/BoostedTreesRegressor)\n\nHowever when you are preparing your custom estimator you also need to provide a **model function** which describes the model of the neural network (convolutions, dropout layers, logits layer and so on). Now when you have a basic idea, let's build the project step by step.\n\n### Includes and loading the datasets in Python\n\n\n","d011899f":"Now once we have the data already in our hands we can start with the actual Tensorflow part.\n\n### Input functions\n\nHere I will define the methods which will serve our data to the Tensorflow neural network during training, evaluating and predicting. Fortenately the Estimator API already provides a method which can read numpy arrays and convert them to tensors, the [numpy_input_fn](https:\/\/www.tensorflow.org\/api_docs\/python\/tf\/estimator\/inputs\/numpy_input_fn). \n\nAll which I will do now is to define small wrapper functions for training, evaluating and predicting using the numpy_input_fn. \n\nNOTE: these functions are not actually performing the training, evaluation and prediction of the neural network. They just serve information to those methods, which are already implemented in the Estimator API!\n\nLet's start with the **training input function**:","da5f09ac":"Here is the **evaluation input function**:","ad829a54":"### Model Function\n\nSo far we have defined only the input functions, now let's define the model of the neural network which we will apply them to:\n","0cc0a0e5":"And finally the **prediction input function**:","2b3bf468":"The training finished with 99.69% accuracy for 10 epochs.
