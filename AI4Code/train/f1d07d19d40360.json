The job bulletin analysis would ideally cover one of the three topics below:**\n1. Identify language that can bias the pool of applicants\n2. Improve the diversity and quality of the applicant pool\n3. Increase the discoverability of promotional pathways\n\n**Lastly, make sure you code\/analysis is well documented as we may use the results in the future to improve the City's hiring processes.**","93852bdb":"### Structuring the Job Bulletin Data into a CSV\n\nHere we're collecting data from all of the job bulletins and storing it in a CSV.\n\nThe code block below goes through all of the job bulletins, extracts the FILE_NAME and OPEN_DATE, and puts it in a list.\n\nWe're only collecting two features here, but ideally your code would collect a lot more. Please refer to the **kaggle_data_dictionary - output_fields.csv** and the **sample job class export template.csv** to see all the features that we're interested in.\n\nAdditional consideration will be given to those who extract more features outside what is listed in the data dictionary we provided. Just be sure to provide an updated data dictionary so that we may understand what you have collected.","bb009afc":"We are now taking the data within the list, putting it in a dataframe so that we can conduct our analysis, and saving the dataframe as a CSV.","fb03dc10":"### Analysis\n\nNow that we have the data structured in a dataframe, we can conduct our analysis.\n\nBelow we're converting the open date into a datetime field. In our analysis we can see the earliest posting was released in 2002, and the latest posting was released February of this year.\n\nThe analysis we provided below is basic, and not very useful.\n\n**Make sure that your analysis is useful by providing actionable insights that are related to the three topics listed:**\n1. Identify language that can bias the pool of applicants\n2. Improve the diversity and quality of the applicant pool\n3.
