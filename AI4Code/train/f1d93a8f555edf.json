For example, in the 'ARTS_AND_DESIGN' category, the peak is at 100,000, which means most of the apps in this category have been installed by more than 100,000 times. On the other hand, the majority of the apps in the category 'WEATHER' were installed 1000,000. This can be seen the 'WEATHER' category is more popular among people. The other intresting category is 'VEDIO_PLAYERS'. The postion of the peak is also at 1000,000. But one thing is noticeable that there are around three apps in 'VIDEO_PLAYERS' was installled more than one billion times, which is not shown in the other two categories.","4d2da18c":"It's noticeable that the feature 'Installs' is categorical, not numerical.

The first one with Rating 19.0 was clearly an outlier. Hence the rating score of 5.0 was the highest.  Although they are highly rated, they are not quite popular, most of which were installed by only 100+ times.","e2af7f46":"I am more interested in the apps installed by more than 1 billion times, hence the data of these apps was analyze. There are 53 apps with installment times larger than 1 billion. The apps with the highest rating score of 4.5 are Google Photes, Instagram, Subway Surfers. Although Facebook has a lower rating score of 4.1, the number of reviews on it is the largest, 78 158 306, followed by the WhatsAppMesseger."}}
