","8e9dfb5b":"# Introduction","729b6aaf":"# **World Marathon Majors**","4dfaaca8":"Winning times vary widely for each of the six WWM locations. However, median winning times appear to be slightly better in certain locations (e.g. London) than in others (such as Boston or NYC). This is particularly evident when comparing London to Boston. ","0a7690a4":"# Marathon wins by location","a4829374":"The US participation, on the other hand, has a much longer history, spanning well over a century. The most successful decade for US athletes were the 1970s, when they won 36 marathons. ","060734d1":"Here we can take a look at which athletes have won the most competitions in the history of these six marathons. Norwegian runner Grete Waitz appears to take the first place with 11 marathons won, while Ingrid Kristiansen (Norway) and Bill Rodgers (USA) won 8 each. ","874cbc8f":"While is has little statistical relevance in itself, 11-times WMM winner Grete Waitz also recorded her best two winning performances in London. ","55b59a5b":"The success of individual countries tend to vary over the decades. Let's take the first two countries in the ranking as an example. Kenyan athletes have won most of their marathons after 1995, having won 35 of them only in the years 2010-2014, and thus enjoying a growing momentum of success in this discipline. ","9ab5f755":"# Most successful athletes","f89e60c9":"The World Marathon Majors (WMM) is a series of worldwide top-level marathons, disputed yearly in six major cities of the world: \n\n* Tokyo (Japan)\n* Boston (USA)\n* London (UK)\n* Berlin (Germany)\n* Chicago (USA)\n* New York City (USA)\n\nWhile the modern WMM was established in 2006, our dataset also includes historical winners of the six marathons since their start (the earliest data is from the Boston marathon in the late 1890s). \n\nThe data provides interesting insights on the development of the competition and on which athletes and countries have been more successful. The purpose here is to take a look at the data and explore which countries and individual athletes have been the most successful in WMM history, and what change can be observed over time and across different host cities. ","bf45a137":"As can be observed in the graphs above, Kenya still retains its strong position across the board, coming in first in London, Tokyo, NYC, and Chicago, and second in Berlin and Boston. We can however observe something more here: for instance, the home country seems to have some advantage with regard to how many of its athletes have won the local WMM. Germany comes on top in the Berlin race, and the UK has a strong second place in the London marathon. The US have by far the most wins in Boston, and lose only to Kenya in Chicago and NYC. Interestingly, the US do not even figure in the top 5 in Berlin, Tokyo and London. \nThere could be many reasons to this; one might think of potential higher barriers to entry for non locally-based athletes, such as higher travel costs, which could make it easier for local athletes to compete. ","321b044a":"# Winning times by WWM location","2701977a":"But what if we isolate each of the six WMM locations while looking at WMM wins by country? Would the results still look the same, i.e. races dominated by Kenya, the US, etc. or can we observe more variance?","42eca87f":"Are all marathons equal? Or do winning performances vary between locations? We can see whether there is any statistically relevant variation with a simple box plot.","772ba3fe":"# The dataset"}}
