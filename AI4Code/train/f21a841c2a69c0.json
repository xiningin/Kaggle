Every industry has pressing questions answered by Big Data. How can a business sort through purchasing data to create a marketing plan? How can government departments use patterns of behavior to create engaging community activities? How can a non-profit best use their available marketing budget to further enhance their potential operations? \n\nIt all comes down to the work of data scientists!\n\nData scientists are trained to gather, organize, and analyze data, helping people from every corner of industry and every segment of the population. There is a nearly infinite amount of information, so there is a nearly infinite amount of uses for data scientists!\n\nIn the 2021 Kaggle survey, the users are primarily showing themselves as 'students' who are here to learn data science and machine learning. We will try to understand, what it takes to become a datascientist in the real world. Read on to learn how to become a data scientist and jump onto this booming career path!\n\nLets ask some questions regarding academic qualifications, coding skills, experience to try to understand what data scientist are doing.\n\nQ1 Which educational qualifications are preferred?\n\nQ2 What coding experince is needed?\n\nQ3 Which coding languages are the most popular ones in the field of data science?\n\nQ4 What is the Machine Learning Experience of Data scientists on Kaggle?\n\nQ5 What all tools do Datascients need to learn to use?\n\n\nQ6 What are the indusrties in which data scientists are employed?\n","86919e5e":"# Tools Data Scientists Love!\nData Science is a vast stream and involves handling data in various ways. As a data scientist or IT professional, you should be aware of the best Data Science tools available in the market to complete your work efficiently. \nKnowing how to use Data Science tools can help you build a bright and promising career in Data Science.\n1. IDE (integrated development enviornments) : Jupyter Notebook and VScode are the preferred IDEs.\n\n2.
