Now lets check level 70-80.","f0c1467f":"1. The below describes initial data set","de15ba29":"2.1.a. Lets check closely level > 80.","74cbfce9":"Our assumption was correct. If you want to buy a better player, with probability of 82% you will pay more.","6179720b":"0. Load and preparation","52a7acc5":"80%, not bad, lets see the graph:","839cb22d":"The goals of the analysis are following: find out how to buy the best player for the lowest price using correlation, is it better to bid or buy it now. If correlation is very close to 1, we will definitely buy better player if we pay more. If it is around 0.5 we will need to search for the best price. It will help to save time for searching players on transfer market.","a9231ef5":"Now it is 82%, lets see praph:","c41679f0":"As you see, there is a strong correlation for players above level 80. 70-80, seems like correlation is weak, we can only say that they are not overpriced, you can easily find players with the same level for lower price. 50-70 we need to analyze additionally.","2309a6e9":"2.2. Now lets check correlation between value and Release Clause price. This price is much higher then value because you can buy players at any time for that price, you do not need to bid.","bf6f769e":"Percentage for 70-80 is almost the same as 80. However, according to the graph you can see that you can buy player with the same overall score but for lower price. However, value 0.8 means that in 80% of cases you will have to pay more for better player.","56c5223a":"1. Correlation between Value and Release Clause is 96%. So, you can't tell which one is better for buying players (bid or buy it now). It depends on the certain case.\n2. To make analysis more accurate I broke down data set into 3 parts: <70, 70-80, > 80. We see strong correlation only when score is greater than 80. It means:\n    - You can pay without worries for a player more (if want to buy better player) only if level > 80.\n    - If level < 80 I advise to check other options, you should be able to find better one.\n3. This analysis shows all levels and all values. My recommendation is to make additional analysis on restricted data. Lets say, players 75-85, and value 50k-100k.","09b40352":"# FIFA 19 price\/overall score correlation","3fd9233e":"Rate is 74%, but as you can see price can be really different.","03e7b199":"2.1. Lets start with correlation between overall score and value.\nNumeric:","08c227c7":"According to the numbers correlation is not so strong (62%). Lets analyze graph to see what's happening:","be8167c8":"It is 96%, and judging from the graph we see there is no reason to make additional analysis based on this metric, because it will be the same.","f0816e89":"2. Theoretically, we should see positive correlation between overall score and release clause\/value. However, we need to see if it is strong.","876ee717":"Graph:","f9da1567":"2.1.c. Level < 70","9b276bba":"It is very similar in comparison with previous value (58% and 62%). Not to waste time on doing the same for Release Clause lets check correlation between Release Clause and Value."}}
