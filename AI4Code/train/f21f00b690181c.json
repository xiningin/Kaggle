To construct a relevent dashboard, one must draw draw from a regularly-updated source, identify metrics which are important important to the mission of the company or goal, and show information which is relevant to decision-making. Dashboards can also show the results of changes which have been made internally in order to support rapid implementation of data driven decisions. \n\nThe dataset I have chosen is the [New York Bus Breakdown and Delays](http:\/\/https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/new-york-city\/ny-bus-breakdown-and-delays) dataset. I chose this dataset because I am passionate about the educational industry as a whole, including the often neglected everyday hereos in the operational components. \n \n As a part of this dashboard exercise and as a fictional representative of the school bus industry, I will delineate the following topics:\n \n* The goals of your organization (like users or measures of pollution)\n    The goal of my organization is to determine the trends in school bus break-down rates by location and service, in order to improve and quote accurate commute times of students in New York state.  \n\n* Things that you (or your colleagues) can change to affect those goals (like advertising spending or the number of factory inspections)\nMy colleagues and I can change the number and quality of busses, the route taken, the lines of communcation, and the training of bus-driving personnel. \n\n* Thing you can't change but that will affect the outcome (like the school year, or weather conditions)\nMy colleagues and I cannot change the drop-off times, traffic congestion, random mechanical failures, school year dates, weather & climate, and school district budgets. \n\n**Let's begin** by loading in the lastest updated dataset.
