This similarity depends on the angle between $u$ and $v$. If $u$ and $v$ are very similar, their cosine similarity will be close to 1; if they are dissimilar, the cosine similarity will take a smaller value. \n\n![](https:\/\/datascience-enthusiast.com\/figures\/cosine_sim.png)","f1a1c1ff":"## Neutralize bias for non-gender specific words \n\nThe figure below should help to visualize what neutralizing does. If you're using a n-dimensional word embedding, the n dimensional space can be split into two parts: The bias-direction $g$, and the remaining n-1 dimensions, which we'll call $g_{\\perp}$. In linear algebra, we say that the n-1 dimensional $g_{\\perp}$ is perpendicular (or \"orthogonal\") to $g$, meaning it is at 90 degrees to $g$. The neutralization step takes a vector such as $e_{receptionist}$ and zeros out the component in the direction of $g$, giving us $e_{receptionist}^{debiased}$. \n\nEven though $g_{\\perp}$ is n-1 dimensional, given the limitations of what we can draw on a screen, we illustrate it using a 1 dimensional axis below. \n\n![](https:\/\/datascience-enthusiast.com\/figures\/neutral.png)\n<caption><center>  The word vector for \"receptionist\" represented before and after applying the neutralize operation. <\/center><\/caption>\n\nTo remove the bias of words such as \"receptionist\" or \"scientist\".

As a concrete example, suppose that \"actress\" is closer to \"babysit\" than \"actor.\" By applying neutralizing to \"babysit\" we can reduce the gender-stereotype associated with babysitting. But this still does not guarantee that \"actor\" and \"actress\" are equidistant from \"babysit.\" The equalization algorithm takes care of this. \n\nThe key idea behind equalization is to make sure that a particular pair of words are equi-distant from the 49-dimensional $g_\\perp$. The equalization step also ensures that the two equalized steps are now the same distance from $e_{receptionist}^{debiased}$, or from any other work that has been neutralized.
