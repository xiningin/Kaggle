It is also known as the coefficient of determination, or the coefficient of multiple determination for multiple regression. \nR-squared is usually between 0 and 100%:\n\n0% indicates that the model explains none of the variability of the response data around its mean.\n100% indicates that the model explains all the variability of the response data around its mean.\nIn general, the higher the R-squared, the better the model fits your data therefore at at 0.963 that is approximately 96% which means the model fits my data set.
