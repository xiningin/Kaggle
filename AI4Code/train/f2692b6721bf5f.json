For example COO- can have -1 charge set on one O, or let it be shared by both oxygens. Hence the fact that some models differ from the data in the table `mulliken_charges` does not mean that it is systematically worse for the end purpose to predict coupling.\n","d78aa843":"# Definition of partial charge\n\nThere is no such thing as a space localized electron, they are rather something like a wave all around atomic nuclei. But there are some models for getting an approximation of the average charge at the location of atoms. This is this what is computed in this kernel under the name partial charge. \n\nOpen babel offers several methods to compute these values (you have to dig into the code to get them) which are all provided under the column with the matching name.","1a2f838b":"# Install OpenBabel\n\nThe installation method was  demonstrated in: [Molecule with OpenBabel](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/jmtest\/molecule-with-openbabel)","e2c99d6a":"# Changelog\n\n* v7 : Include test molecules in a separate dataframe and updated the external dataset accordingly\n* v5 : building of output dataset `ob_charges` with train molecules\n* v4 : first public version\n","9cf2a894":"# Synopsis\n\n![OpenBabel](http:\/\/openbabel.org\/babel130.png)\n\nIn this kernel I will explore an alternative way of calculating local `mulliken charges`. \nYou may be interrested only if you wish to incorportate these features in your model.  \n=> The charges calculated with Open Babel are available as an autonomous dataset in [Open Babel Atom Charges](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/asauve\/open-babel-atom-charges)\n\nThe [Open Babel](http:\/\/openbabel.org\/wiki\/Main_Page) Package allow to\n* Read .xyz files (the ones provided in the structures directory)\n* Build bonding scheme (groovy baby!)\n* Compute partial charges, with several builtin methods\n\nHumm this last one is really interresting as it provides a quick way of computing atoms local charge with a method based on linear algebra. Hence it is fast and in the range of the allowed options for the competition.\n\nThe most promising method is Electronegativity Equalization Method  (EEM) which is describeed in this paper:  \n[High-quality and universal empirical atomic charges for chemoinformatics applications](https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4667495\/)\n\n\n","193f91d3":"# Compare Mulliken charges to Open Babel EEM"}}
