You must create your CNN _from scratch_ (so, you can't use transfer learning _yet_!), and you must attain a test accuracy of at least 10%.  In Step 4 of this notebook, you will have the opportunity to use transfer learning to create a CNN that attains greatly improved accuracy.\n\nWe mention that the task of assigning breed to dogs from images is considered exceptionally challenging.  To see why, consider that *even a human* would have trouble distinguishing between a Brittany and a Welsh Springer Spaniel.  \n\nBrittany | Welsh Springer Spaniel\n- | - \n<img src=\"images\/Brittany_02625.jpg\" width=\"100\"> | <img src=\"images\/Welsh_springer_spaniel_08203.jpg\" width=\"200\">\n\nIt is not difficult to find other dog breed pairs with minimal inter-class variation (for instance, Curly-Coated Retrievers and American Water Spaniels).  \n\nCurly-Coated Retriever | American Water Spaniel\n- | -\n<img src=\"images\/Curly-coated_retriever_03896.jpg\" width=\"200\"> | <img src=\"images\/American_water_spaniel_00648.jpg\" width=\"200\">\n\n\nLikewise, recall that labradors come in yellow, chocolate, and black.  Your vision-based algorithm will have to conquer this high intra-class variation to determine how to classify all of these different shades as the same breed.  \n\nYellow Labrador | Chocolate Labrador | Black Labrador\n- | -\n<img src=\"images\/Labrador_retriever_06457.jpg\" width=\"150\"> | <img src=\"images\/Labrador_retriever_06455.jpg\" width=\"240\"> | <img src=\"images\/Labrador_retriever_06449.jpg\" width=\"220\">\n\nWe also mention that random chance presents an exceptionally low bar: setting aside the fact that the classes are slightly imabalanced, a random guess will provide a correct answer roughly 1 in 133 times, which corresponds to an accuracy of less than 1%.  \n\nRemember that the practice is far ahead of the theory in deep learning.  Experiment with many different architectures, and trust your intuition.

Please use the code cell below to design and test your own face detection algorithm.  If you decide to pursue this _optional_ task, report performance on `human_files_short` and `dog_files_short`.","8736634b":"**Question 3:** Describe your chosen procedure for preprocessing the data. \n- How does your code resize the images (by cropping, stretching, etc)?  What size did you pick for the input tensor, and why?\n- Did you decide to augment the dataset?  If so, how (through translations, flips, rotations, etc)?  If not, why not?\n","37e866da":"### (IMPLEMENTATION) Specify Loss Function and Optimizer\n\nUse the next code cell to specify a [loss function](http:\/\/pytorch.org\/docs\/master\/nn.html#loss-functions) and [optimizer](http:\/\/pytorch.org\/docs\/master\/optim.html).  Save the chosen loss function as `criterion_transfer`, and the optimizer as `optimizer_transfer` below.","4c0b39c3":"__Answer:__ \n","0aeb254c":"<a id='step1'><\/a>\n## Step 1: Detect Humans\n\nIn this section, we use OpenCV's implementation of [Haar feature-based cascade classifiers](http:\/\/docs.opencv.org\/trunk\/d7\/d8b\/tutorial_py_face_detection.html) to detect human faces in images.  \n\nOpenCV provides many pre-trained face detectors, stored as XML files on [github](https:\/\/github.com\/opencv\/opencv\/tree\/master\/data\/haarcascades).  We have downloaded one of these detectors and stored it in the `haarcascades` directory.  In the next code cell, we demonstrate how to use this detector to find human faces in a sample image."}}
