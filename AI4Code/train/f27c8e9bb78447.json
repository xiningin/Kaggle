But there is another catch. The percentage values are appended by a `%` symbol. \n\nTo expunge this problem, again, we can do two things. \n* Trim the symbol from the values and typecast.\n* Calculate the percentage from scratch.\n\nI personally prefer calculating the percentage values from scratch since we already have the numbers given too.

It was founded in 1923 and originally run by Henry Luce.\n\nTime has the world's largest circulation for a weekly news magazine. The print edition has a readership of 26 million, 20 million of whom are based in the United States. In mid-2012, its circulation was over three million, which had lowered to two million by late 2017.\n\nThe uploaded dataset sheds light on how gender diversity is maintained while choosing cover pictures for the magazine since their beginning in 1923 till 2013. \n\nDoes Time really abide by equality? In this world of media having infiltrated our lives to the greatest extent, is Time a responsible bearer of gender miscellany? These are the few questions I tried to address via the dataset. \n","4d936c1b":"## B.

","cb5ba833":"# **Visualization of Data**\n<br>\nThe percentage values have been converted, not typecasted, from `float` to `int` here and hence what we popularly call as **rounded** values in mathematics have not been taken. The conversion has been done by **flooring** the values. \n\nFor example, `2.86` should have been rounded to `3` but has been floored to `2`. \n\nAnd because of this, we get discrepancies in the sum of the two percentages. What we need to create beautiful stacked bars is a constant sum of percentages (Male and Female), else some bars will have a height lesser or more than others. \n\nTo fix this issue, we perform a simple trick. What we do is we find out the rows whose sum of `MalePerc` and `FemalePerc` is not equal to `100` (because we know the sum of percentages should always be `100`) and adjust any one of `MalePerc` or `FemalePerc` such that the sum is equal to 100. This process is actually a work-around for **rounding** the values, which we did not do while conversion.","415f2cd4":"Teasing the data more, ","9706f773":"Now if we check the sum of percentages for regularizing the data,"}}
