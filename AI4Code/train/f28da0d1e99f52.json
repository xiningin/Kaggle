Although not explicitly noted, further looking into the website vgchartz.com revealed that it only measures ***physical*** copies of game sales. \n\nAround the year 2008 and thereafter, software versions of titles slowly started becoming more normal due to the increased storage capacities of hardware and faster internet download speeds. Billion dollar contemporary video games such as \"Fortnite\" specifically actually have no physical version -- and are free to begin with (making money mostly through in-game purchases and thus have no initial \"sale\").
