During this international emergency, the children they support are more at risk than ever. All of the children and young people our partners work with come from economically precarious families who rely on informal employment to survive, with little to no savings and living each day hand to mouth. During the lockdown they cannot go to work and receive their daily income, which has made covering the rent, food and toiletries extremely difficult.https:\/\/www.childrenchangecolombia.org\/news\/335\/35\/Help-Colombia-Covid-19","204ba7ed":"#The Pandemic threatens to widen inequality in Latin America, by  Julie Turkewitz And Sofia Villamil\n\nIn Medellin, which is considered the Silicon Valley of the region, there has been a widespread loss of jobs and hunger.\n\nOver the past two decades, inequality in Latin America fell to the lowest point in its history. The pandemic threatens to reverse it. \n\nBOGOT, Colombia \u2014 The pandemic came , they loose jobs. Some are evicted, forced to move to sheds in an illegal settlement atop the city. A life of efforts had vanished in a matter of weeks.\n\nNot long ago, Colombia\u2014and Latin America in general\u2014was in the midst of a historic transformation: the scourge of inequality was shrinking like never before. Over the past 20 years, millions of families have risen out of poverty in one of the most unequal regions on the planet. The gap between rich and poor in Latin America fell to the lowest record.\n\nNow, the pandemic threatens to reverse those achievements like no other phenomenon in recent history, economists say, which can potentially drastically change politics and entire societies in the coming years.\nhttps:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/es\/2020\/07\/11\/espanol\/america-latina\/desigualdad-coronavirus-america-latina-colombia.html","379bd46d":"Das War's, Kaggle Notebook Runner: Mar\u00edlia Prata  @mpwolke "}}
