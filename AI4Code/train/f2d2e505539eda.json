Cause the dataset is so **flawed** that **71%** of it consists of **1's** which means if you submitted with just **1's** you would get **71%**. Now you have to know that we have to submit **86 cases, 30%** of which were considered for the private score. Which means **26** cases. So now I just switched one value for a **2** and I got that accuracy, lets analyze this.\n\n## Machine Learning Time:\n\nsay number of **1's** in the private scoring data was X and number of **2's** in the private scoring data was Y. Then, we know **X + Y = 26**\nWe also know that we switched only one value to **2** **(Id=7)**. Basically we got all the 1's correct which means all the X's correct and (Y-1) wrong. So my accuracy being **0.88461 * 26** gives us 23. So basically I got **23 correct**. Which means **3 incorrect**. So,\n\nY-1 = 3\nSo, Y=4. That means only **4 values** were labelled **2**. Which is *dumb*, what are you trying to evaluate **dude**. You see the rise in ranks some of these people have gotten on the top shelves. Luck is the answer? I mean see the difference between the public and private ranks. That's not rise you see everyday unless its *Corona*. Plz don't be unfair and judge by this private score list. Look at both of them.\n\n# Thanks for coming to my TED Talk~"}}
