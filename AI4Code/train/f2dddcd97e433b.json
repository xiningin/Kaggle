Objective\n\nHere we want to understand the raw data and try to isolate the data for different purpose (e.g., text mining, indexing, network-data for citation network). This notebook will walk you through collecting all data file-names in a python list and provide you a internal structure of the document. We will go through isolation of text data and citation mapping table.\n\nGetting hard to see this notebook?
