This system uses item metadata, such as genre, director, description, actors, etc. for movies, to make these recommendations. The general idea behind these recommender systems is that if a person likes a particular item, he or she will also like an item that is similar to it. And to recommend that, it will make use of the user's past item metadata. A good example could be YouTube, where based on your history, it suggests you new videos that you could potentially watch.\n\n> **Collaborative filtering engines**: these systems are widely used, and they try to predict the rating or preference that a user would give an item-based on past ratings and preferences of other users. Collaborative filters do not require item metadata like its content-based counterparts.","92d134c2":"# **Enhancements**","1355786d":"You are now in a position to create your \"metadata\", which is a string that contains all the metadata that you want to feed to your vectorizer (namely actors, director and keywords).\n\nThe create_metadata function will simply join all the required columns by a space. This is the final preprocessing step, and the output of this function will be fed into the word vector model.","a0d9174c":"The next steps are the same as what you did with above content based recommender.\n\nOne key difference is that you use the CountVectorizer() instead of TF-IDF. This is because you do not want to down-weight the actor\/director's presence if he or she has acted or directed in relatively more movies. It doesn't make much intuitive sense to down-weight them in this context.\n\nThe major difference between CountVectorizer() and TF-IDF is the inverse document frequency (IDF) component which is present in","2916531a":"Recommender systems are among the most popular applications of data science today. They are used to predict the \"rating\" or \"preference\" that a user would give to an item. Almost every major tech company has applied them in some form. Amazon uses it to suggest products to customers, YouTube uses it to decide which video to play next on autoplay, and Facebook uses it to recommend pages to like and people to follow.\n\nRecommender systems have also been developed to explore research articles and experts, collaborators, and financial services.
