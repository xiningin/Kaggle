So open a new window by clicking on [this link](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/home-data-for-ml-course).  Then click on the **Join Competition** button.\n\n![join competition image](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/wLmFtH3.png)\n\nNext, follow the instructions below:\n- Begin by clicking on the blue **COMMIT** button in the top right corner.  This will generate a pop-up window.  \n- After your code has finished running, click on the blue **Open Version** button in the top right of the pop-up window.  This brings you into view mode of the same page. You will need to scroll down to get back to these instructions.\n- Click on the **Output** tab on the left of the screen.  Then, click on the **Submit to Competition** button to submit your results to the leaderboard.\n- If you want to keep working to improve your performance, select the blue **Edit** button in the top right of the screen.
