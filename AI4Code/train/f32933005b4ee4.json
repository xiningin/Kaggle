I knew what I needed to do, but was having some difficulty knowing how to cde it specifically.  The bar chart shws that the multiple disease class is so infrequent, only making up 91 of the images in the data.  One way I could deal with it is multiply the size of the class by 5 or 6 to increase it to 455 - 546 instances. I will probably try this to see how it works, as well as read up on why this simple method should not be done. I will see if I can use the image generator, where it rotates, zooms, and transposes the images to help with the issue of having 5 or 6 copies of a multiple disease training instance.  \n\n"}}
