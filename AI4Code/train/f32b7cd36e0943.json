This method tells us a lot of things about a dataset. One important thing is that the `describe()` method deals only with numeric values. It doesn't work with any categorical values. \n\nNow, let's understand the statistics that are generated by the `describe()` method:\n\n* `count` tells us the number of `NoN-empty` rows in a feature.\n\n* `mean` tells us the mean value of that feature.\n\n* `std` tells us the Standard Deviation Value of that feature.\n\n* `min` tells us the minimum value of that feature.\n\n* `25%`, `50%`, and `75%` are the percentile\/quartile of each features.

One is the __distribution of a feature__ and another is the __relationship between one feature to all others__. If we look at the diagonal we can see the distribution of each feature. Let\u2019s consider the `first row X first column`, this diagonal shows us the distribution of `pelvic_incidence`. Similarly, if we look at the `second row X second column` diagonal we can see the distribution of `pelvic_tilt`. All the cells except the diagonals show the relationship between one feature to another.

But since, most of the machine learning algorithms use Eucledian distance between two data points in their computations, this will create a problem. To avoid this effect, we need to bring all features to the same level of magnitudes.

It\u2019s a symptom of several different types of medical problems. It usually results from a problem with one or more parts of the lower back, such as:\n* ligaments\n* muscles\n* nerves\n* the bony structures that make up the spine, called vertebral bodies or vertebrae\n\nLower back pain can also be due to a problem with nearby organs, such as the kidneys.\n\nAccording to the American Association of Neurological Surgeons, 75 to 85 percent of Americans will experience back pain in their lifetime. Of those, 50 percent will have more than one episode within a year. In 90 percent of all cases, the pain gets better without surgery. Talk to your doctor if you\u2019re experiencing back pain. \n\nIn this [Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Exploratory_data_analysis) I am going to use the Lower Back Pain Symptoms Dataset and try to find out interesting insights of this dataset. \n\n\n## Dataset Description\nThis dataset contains:\n* 310 Observations\n* 12 Features \n* 1 Lebel\n\n|__ col. no.__| __Attribute name__| __type__| \n|-------------|---------------------|-----------|\n| Col1 | pelvic_incidence | numeric, float64|\n|Col2|pelvic_tilt |numeric, float64 |\n|Col3| lumbar_lordosis_angle |numeric, float64|\n|Col4|sacral_slope|numeric, float64|\n|Col5| pelvic_radius  |numeric, float64|\n|Col6|degree_spondylolisthesis   |numeric, float64|\n|Col7| pelvic_slope |numeric, float64|\n|Col8|Direct_tilt  |numeric, float64|\n|Col9| thoracic_slope |numeric, float64|\n|Col10|  cervical_tilt |numeric, float64|\n|Col11| sacrum_angle |numeric, float64|\n|Col12| scoliosis_slope |numeric, float64|\n|Class_att| Attribute Class | categorical, object|\n","09658cdd":"## Correlation between features\nA [correlation coefficient](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Correlation_coefficient) is a numerical measure of some type of correlation, meaning a statistical relationship between two variables.","a86faf0a":"## Label Encoding\nCertain algorithms like XGBoost can only have numerical values as their predictor variables.
