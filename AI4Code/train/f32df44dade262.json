By Dr Marcel A Behr\n\nPublished:February, 2002DOI:https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/S1473-3099(02)00182-2\n\nThe existence of different BCG strains has been described since the 1940s. These strains vary according to several laboratory properties, which may or may not translate into a discernible effect on vaccination.\n\nWith recent genomic comparisons, it is now clear that different BCG vaccine strains have evolved and differ from each other and from the original BCG first used in 1921. Some of these genetic alterations explain certain variations in laboratory properties of BCG. However, these mutations in BCG strains have yet to be shown to affect BCG-associated protection and\/or adverse effects. \n\nContinuing research is attempting to assess the effect of these genetic alterations on properties of BCG strains, with the goals of suggesting the ideal BCG for vaccination and providing avenues for improvement on existing BCG vaccines.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.thelancet.com\/pdfs\/journals\/laninf\/PIIS1473309902001822.pdf","7d2a58bd":"#East and West Germany different BCG vaccination schemes before 1990.","410f4502":"Different Strains of Bacillus Calmette\u2013Gu\u00e9rin Vaccine Have ...academic.oup.com \u203a cid \u203a article-pdf \u203a civ454\nJun 9, 2015, By Frank Shann - Department of Paediatrics, Intensive Care Unit, Royal Children\u2019s Hospital, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Australia\n\nThe BCG vaccine is not a single vaccine; the different strains have very different properties, and there are different genotypes within strains. It is likely that they could substantially improve protection against tuberculosis and lower child mortality from other infections by manufacturing each BCG vaccine from a single genotype, comparing these vaccines to find which genotype has the strongest effects against tuberculosis and against other infections, investigating the effect of revaccination on all-cause mortality,and ensuring that a high proportion of neonates are given BCG vaccine in the first few days of life. These measures are\nlikely to yield very large benefits at minimal cost.","f9cd6a0b":"By Luis E.

In West Germany, those 22 years to 59 years old today were vaccinated, while, in East Germany, those 45 years to 84 years old today received at least one dose of BCG. A comparison of these two regions revealed that the average COVID-19 mortality rate in western German states (40.5 per million) was 2.9-fold higher than in eastern states (14.2 per million) . Similarly, the mean mortality in Western Europe was 9.92 times higher than in Eastern Europe (t  = \u22122.592, P < 0.025), where countries, in general, have active universal BCG vaccination programs.\n![](https:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/pnas\/early\/2020\/07\/07\/2008410117\/F3.medium.gif)\nBy Luis E.

BCG vaccine may also have important nonspecific effects in high-income countries. In a cohort study in Spain, BCG\u2013Danish vaccine reduced nontuberculous hospital admissions in infants by 32 per cent (95 per cent CI, 31 per cent\u201334 per cent) for respiratory infections and by 53 per cent (95 per cent CI, 44 per cent\u201361 per cent) for sepsis.\n\nIt would be desirable to test whether revaccination with BCG vaccine reduces all-cause mortality in children who do not develop a scar after a single dose. In addition, in the randomized trial in Guinea-Bissau that showed reduced mortality after revaccination at age 19 months, 77 per cent of the children had a scar . Consequently, further randomized trials are needed to test the effects of revaccination on all-cause mortality in children who have a scar following BCG vaccination at birth, as well as those without a\nscar. Revaccination with BCG vaccine confers little or no extra protection against tuberculosis but it may improve protection\nagainst leprosy and increase the beneficial nonspecific effects of BCG vaccine.\n\nIt's known that BCG vaccine protects against infections other than tuberculosis,at least in part, by an epigenetic effect mediated by methylation of histone that alters innate immunity in adults and neonates. It would be ironic if they were to discover that BCG vaccine protects against tuberculosis via a nonspecific effect mediated by innate immunity. They urgently need to know more about the mechanisms by which BCG vaccine protects against mycobacterial and nonmycobacterial infections.\n\nhttps:\/\/watermark.silverchair.com\/civ454.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAp4wggKaBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggKLMIIChwIBADCCAoAGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMc7XkkxH0ji-h5pGIAgEQgIICUZuB3mvftiCqTEGwoJ5due8WoUP8eYnKjgjPHxHjJaBwZ0bKYyyJ8G3eS38lk_Qb5_JI7XdyHI8SZII3T3lNblg6zQ0-uA50RRG95Qn7eKtVHZXlbAKVUwVepV5k_dSQYmmft8erc-0ns224a7BU2MxDspQdD7bLN9145KmB0SFdCjR9YUFs58YDDcOL9XTtK2OKBA_L0zUqShkBJhNO6l8IozplL9C9Yyy7gpndV2aGY4LgdXrRpKKw0MqKmgoG5JQnySKf9I_8omSUx4JDfu6x2OPPpBr0n3PV1PC3Zah7EgNwSeC-d7kTGI_DEOWnVMTx2DikOvF7KBdPi9Gz1XItxjVSpn0eS1RY3wlORtTFMl4NbqZK46zbHRUOzHPC7-NBBQaRPVDflgWNvQ5gXWkZwih6G05mAe2OEXwSY3AZJHOy6XzFyCfsGGxBe3vKup4axO5vQ2Edtcdm4gJJGBcGJ8dr0CsAFAspBcFUT6vNmRCtBx0d380JM5ooBJHSMqKQEZBANFmguDCyHzn21i_L5RD9yEQHk1TcN1IFwLCV3oxL6_vEusV1UGJNNJOIi25EcXduwHz8MBZ4k-bLFwJqQ90pryuIk_IS10EqakmxlvWD3ozb18XC51wAwDe9otI8bVgaYiCOyz7BKHQmh78lBRGqudC89uTpLHqVR6w0T1gF_1jo3jv2NCD_L8h76JhpeBNDYALKo31719wTne2Lhijyta431bChj9if0MzL3NJjWVBaituOXYdz6Oq6mMjxp044zjLfkvZ7JEPVwCVe","c823f89c":"#Revaccinations (boosters) been given.

The authors present evidence that the lower mortality was unlikely to be explained by healthier children being more likely to form a scar, and the results are consistent with previous studies showing a relationship between BCG\u2013Danish vaccine scar and survival.\n\nIn addition to the important genetic differences between the strains of BCG, there are genetic differences within some strains that can cause major differences in the characteristics of BCG vaccine produced from the same seed lot by different manufacturers and between different batches from a single manufacturer. BCG-Tokyo and BCG-Danish vaccines each contain at least 2 genotypes. BCG\u2013Danish vaccine and probably BCG\u2013Tokyo vaccine have potent nonspecific effects that substantially reduce mortality from diseases other than tuberculosis; however, these beneficial effects are not properly exploited at present. \n\nhttps:\/\/watermark.silverchair.com\/civ454.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAqAwggKcBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggKNMIICiQIBADCCAoIGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMUl5xbptDKcm4IIz8AgEQgIICU5-mvna7_1GF_uo8mFEjKjdQArrCyF6A8TrH-t7_Zo_WRFVxtereMobF1hYBKcQbPaTPMau2a4QWPedT-Oca0i_rE3xZkfPlbYHr7jRESmtddIzqKkmeTALijHLIQqXM8V0nMNIeKv1Ra-OIVOSU7q5-Tsm3wbvxk2cx99pk9EHZadCns569JIOjMuhV8M9Ap32Cc9R12aiod5g_dMvDbmjs4f9VWC7yuyHmBLGtk8852Ei-g6Czhf00Rp5hVLzaGoIBQ08SCwqIpQl_2NQXyo-LeeeFeNP5JhyfOY4zi9KaatBkQC8pQGpodwwTPmAmuLmX9Sb0Co6JQJJRcuveWvXDTWJ4wG0ppXTlUfCAdh1USBAHp4wMlr_PAUsgm03IDppoprj6MFi5lPgLe7EpoUSDohzlie4Lrsjj1Hs3OFhRGRqoBPqrMOsa5GtCmaPfNDpqlB7DUph0fT5uFgY7mRQg3XxmCWNkQpcwwvVO1oYQ2OY-EzXRXzpRQ9vbz-eT9F1HzpcPxty78aMK1vbgSI0xxoqGmX4CHTtdI1Zdvlmah8Vq-saAYpTghgMJfFpk8kqfPIXIdVhlxdhFGeLoL0NhGAZ8c4xsZZRdJAHBX9D6mUrJbCe8-bo92wgEpsWld_-0DGeudUGarCDpHL2zJq6A_wU6yuayy3u1-ZdVbYt-UKmXEWquWT5h4T855K_Xy8-k_yFSuNRZtV2IkKIg9NnthlxCYBrvgRb6DLxkmd5W-O7R4dMNIwmg0XY4ukkBDzKGzxt7MzTVSIBb2LXfNsYWYw4","8375a9c4":"The font size is enlarged, however I still can't read The High-risk Groups that receive BCG.
