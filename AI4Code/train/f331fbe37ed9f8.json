Although causation cannot be infered by these charts, consider that the categories are food, houshold, and hobbies. It might be interesting to split these plots by category. For example, more food items may be sold before holidays associated with large family gatherings, but they are not as popular on Black Friday. Also, Monday holidays are always comming off a weekend, when sales normally peak.
