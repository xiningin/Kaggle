**KNeighborsClassifier** with the exception of two parameters. First, in RadiusNeighborsClassifier we need to specify the radius of the fixed area used to determine if an observation is a neighbor using radius. Unless there is some substantive reason for setting radius to some value, it is best to treat it like any other hyperparameter and tune it during model selection. The second useful parameter is outlier_label, which indicates what label to give an observation that has no observations within the radius - which itself can often be a useful tool for identifying outliers.","4ca7231b":"<a id=\"61\"><\/a> <br>\n## 6-1 Data Collection\n**Iris dataset**  consists of 3 different types of irises\u2019 (Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica) petal and sepal length, stored in a 150x4 numpy.ndarray\n\nThe rows being the samples and the columns being: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length and Petal Width.[6]\n","e76ae278":"In this kernel, I have tried to cover all the parts related to the process of **Machine Learning** with a variety of Python packages and I know that there are still some problems then I hope to get your feedback to improve it.\n<br>\n[go to top](#top)","4e43aac5":"<a id=\"623\"><\/a> <br>\n### 6-2-3 Histogram\nWe can also create a **histogram** of each input variable to get an idea of the distribution.\n\n[go to top](#top)","31768fa1":"<a id=\"6\"><\/a> <br>\n## 6- Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)\n In this section, you'll learn how to use graphical and numerical techniques to begin uncovering the structure of your data. \n \n* Which variables suggest interesting relationships?\n* Which observations are unusual?\n\nBy the end of the section, you'll be able to answer these questions and more, while generating graphics that are both insightful and beautiful.  then We will review analytical and statistical operations:\n\n*   5-1 Data Collection\n*   5-2 Visualization\n*   5-3 Data Preprocessing\n*   5-4 Data Cleaning\n<img src=\"http:\/\/s9.picofile.com\/file\/8338476134\/EDA.png\">","26b29773":"To check out last 5 row of the data set, we use tail() function","0e471a43":"## <div style=\"text-align: center\"> +20 ML Algorithms +15 Plot for Beginners<\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center\"><b>Quite Practical and Far from any Theoretical Concepts<\/b><\/div>\n<img src='https:\/\/image.ibb.co\/gbH3ue\/iris.png'>\n<div style=\"text-align: center\">[Image-Credit](https:\/\/medium.com\/@jebaseelanravi96\/machine-learning-iris-classification-33aa18a4a983)<\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">last update: <b>12\/02\/2019<\/b><\/div>\n\n> You are reading **10 Steps to Become a Data Scientist** and are now in the 9th step : \n\n1.

This dataset contains information about three different types of Iris flowers:\n\n1. Iris Versicolor\n1. Iris Virginica\n1. Iris Setosa\n\nThe data set contains measurements of four variables :\n\n1. sepal length \n1. sepal width\n1. petal length \n1. petal width\n \nThe Iris data set has a number of interesting features:\n\n1. One of the classes (Iris Setosa) is linearly separable from the other two. However, the other two classes are not linearly separable.\n\n2. There is some overlap between the Versicolor and Virginica classes, so it is unlikely to achieve a perfect classification rate.\n\n3. There is some redundancy in the four input variables, so it is possible to achieve a good solution with only three of them, or even (with difficulty) from two, but the precise choice of best variables is not obvious.\n\n**Why am I  using iris dataset:**\n\n1- This is a good project because it is so well understood.\n\n2- Attributes are numeric so you have to figure out how to load and handle data.\n\n3- It is a classification problem, allowing you to practice with perhaps an easier type of supervised learning algorithm.\n\n4- It is a multi-class classification problem (multi-nominal) that may require some specialized handling.\n\n5- It only has 4 attributes and 150 rows, meaning it is small and easily fits into memory (and a screen or A4 page).\n\n6- All of the numeric attributes are in the same units and the same scale, not requiring any special scaling or transforms to get started.[5]\n\n7- we can define problem as clustering(unsupervised algorithm) project too.\n<a id=\"32\"><\/a> <br>\n### 3-2 Aim\nThe aim is to classify iris flowers among three species (setosa, versicolor or virginica) from measurements of length and width of sepals and petals\n<a id=\"33\"><\/a> <br>\n### 3-3 Variables\nThe variables are :\n**sepal_length**: Sepal length, in centimeters, used as input.\n**sepal_width**: Sepal width, in centimeters, used as input.\n**petal_length**: Petal length, in centimeters, used as input.\n**petal_width**: Petal width, in centimeters, used as input.\n**setosa**: Iris setosa, true or false, used as target.\n**versicolour**: Iris versicolour, true or false, used as target.\n**virginica**: Iris virginica, true or false, used as target.\n\n**<< Note >>**\n> You must answer the following question:\nHow does your company expact to use and benfit from your model.\n<br>\n[go to top](#top)","6afa72b9":"<a id=\"712\"><\/a> <br>\n## 7-12 Linear Support Vector Classification\n\nSimilar to **SVC** with parameter kernel=\u2019linear\u2019, but implemented in terms of liblinear rather than libsvm, so it has more flexibility in the choice of penalties and loss functions and should scale better to large numbers of samples.","2e008f50":"**<< Note 2 >>**\n<br>\n> in pandas's data frame you can perform some query such as \"where\".","62ceb956":"<a id=\"715\"><\/a> <br>\n## 7-15 Neural network\n\nI have used multi-layer Perceptron classifier.\nThis model optimizes the log-loss function using **LBFGS** or **stochastic gradient descent**.","b2f5e0cd":"<a id=\"64\"><\/a> <br>\n## 6-4 Data Cleaning\nWhen dealing with real-world data, dirty data is the norm rather than the exception. We continuously need to predict correct values, impute missing ones, and find links between various data artefacts such as schemas and records. We need to stop treating data cleaning as a piecemeal exercise (resolving different types of errors in isolation), and instead leverage all signals and resources (such as constraints, available statistics, and dictionaries) to accurately predict corrective actions.[12]","a48e49bd":"<a id=\"629\"><\/a> <br>\n###  6-2-9 andrews_curves","7faa2d95":"<a id=\"74\"><\/a> <br>\n## 7-4 K-Nearest Neighbours\nIn **Machine Learning**, the **k-nearest neighbors algorithm** (k-NN) is a non-parametric method used for classification and regression. In both cases, the input consists of the k closest training examples in the feature space. The output depends on whether k-NN is used for classification or regression[https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm):\n\nIn k-NN classification, the output is a class membership. An object is classified by a majority vote of its neighbors, with the object being assigned to the class most common among its k nearest neighbors (k is a positive integer, typically small). If k = 1, then the object is simply assigned to the class of that single nearest neighbor.\nIn k-NN regression, the output is the property value for the object. This value is the average of the values of its k nearest neighbors.\nk-NN is a type of instance-based learning, or lazy learning, where the function is only approximated locally and all computation is deferred until classification. The k-NN algorithm is among the simplest of all machine learning algorithms.","345a6b32":"For OR we could implement a perceptron as:","36a052ad":"Our neural unit would compute $z$ as the **dot-product** $w \\cdot x$ and add the **bias** $b$ to it.
