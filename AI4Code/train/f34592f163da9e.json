Note that nitrogen dioxide is a form of nitrogen oxide. In addition, [this](https:\/\/www.scientificamerican.com\/article\/ozone-pollution-grows-but-it-can-be-fixed\/) website on the Scientific American says that, there is a correlation between nitrogen oxide levels and ground-level ozone levels. Nitrogen oxide pollution, combined with volatile organic compounds, interact in the presence of sunlight to produce ground-level ozone pollution [16]. Since Singapore is a tropical island, we get a lot of sunlight which could explain the high ozone levels. \n\nHowever, it is suprising that the correlation between the vehicle population and carbon monoxide is very low. This is because, we are thought in school that vehciles produce a very high amount of carbon dioxide. Possibly, the development of [greener cars](http:\/\/www.green-venture.net\/Global-development---astonishing-facts-about-E--and-eco-friendly-cars_2327.aspx) [17] and Singapore's [green transport initiatives](http:\/\/www.greenfuture.sg\/2012\/05\/30\/2012-guide-to-singapore-government-funding-and-incentives-for-the-environment\/) [18] has cause vehicles to be more eco friendly and produce less carbon monoxide.\n\nWe can conclude that there is **sufficient** evidence to support my third hypothesis.","8f04d435":"# Data Exploration\nBefore we begin, I would like to import all data and understand the significance of each data file.","2ca81559":"# Pollution data\n## Data preprocessing","b46a5fd3":"## Observation\n\nAs seen from the table above, all three features are very closely related, more than 80%, to the ozone pollution.

In an even broader sense, air pollution means the presence of chemicals or compounds in the air which are usually not present and which lower the quality of the air or cause detrimental changes to the quality of life (such as the damaging of the ozone layer or causing global warming).\n\nAir pollution is probably one of the most serious environmental problems confronting our civilization today. Most often, it is caused by human activities such as mining, construction, transportation, industrial work, agriculture, smelting, etc. However, natural processes such as volcanic eruptions and wildfires may also pollute the air, but their occurrence are rare and they usually have a local effect, unlike human activities that are ubiquitous causes of air pollution and contribute to the global pollution of the air every single day [3].\n\nThe NEA measures several common pollutants in ambient air [2]. Thus those are the pollutants that we will be studying.\n* Sulphur dioxide ( SO2 ) : [This contaminant](http:\/\/www.environment.gov.au\/protection\/publications\/factsheet-sulfur-dioxide-so2) is mainly emitted during the combustion of fossil fuels such as crude oil and coal [4].\n* Carbon monoxide ( CO ) : [This gas](https:\/\/www.nap.edu\/read\/10378\/chapter\/3) is emitted during the incomplete combustion of fuels. For example, a car engine running idle [5].\n* Nitrogen dioxide ( NO2 ) : [These contaminants](https:\/\/www.greenfacts.org\/en\/nitrogen-dioxide-no2\/level-3\/01-presentation.htm#0p0) are emitted by idle vehicle engines and the energy production industries [6].\n* Ozone ( O3 ) : Near ground level [ozone](http:\/\/www.theozonehole.com\/badozone.htm) is created through the influence of ultra violet sunlight (UV) on pollutants emitted by cars, power plants, industrial boilers, refineries and chemical plants [7].\n* Particulate Matter ( PM ) : [Particulate matter ](https:\/\/www.nea.gov.sg\/our-services\/pollution-control\/air-pollution\/faqs)is the sum of all solid and liquid particles suspended in air. NEA uses two measurements: PM-10 (10 micrometers or less) and PM-2.5 (2.5 micrometers or less). This complex mixture includes both organic and inorganic particles, such as dust, pollen, soot, smoke, and liquid droplets. These particles vary greatly in size, composition, and origin [8].","bf700432":"## Observation\nThis graph supports the above observation as it can be seen that the trends of the ozone pollution and Chemicals industry are very similar.","67dadb2b":"# Further development\nFurther improvements to identify sources of pollution can be made by studying more recent data, when it becomes available, or by studying other factors such as haze, shipping and Waste incineration.","a2848fe8":"## Data preprocessing for residential development\n\nFirst, for the HDB development dataset, we select the data from 2008 to 2014.

This makes sense as most of the harmful pollutants produced by idle vehicle engines at the constructon site are exposed to direct sunlight for an extended period of time.

Also, we will only be looking at data of the flats that are 'under construction' as pollution is mainly produced during construction.","a600830f":"# Results analysis\nThe analysis flow can be summarised into four main steps. They are as follows:\n\nFirst, we will download, import and explore the data. As mentioned previously, the download links for the data used can be found at the end of this document. All downloaded data are in the form of a comma-separated values (CSV) file.\n\nSecond, we will perform data cleansing. In this step, the first thing I did was to remove all NaN or 0 values and select a timeframe to study. Then I will perform [mean normalization](https:\/\/medium.com\/greyatom\/why-how-and-when-to-scale-your-features-4b30ab09db5e) on the data to get a more accurate statistical analysis and graphical plot [9]. We have to normalize our data because our features do not have a uniform scale. Since I wanted data that was centered at zero and kept within a small range, mean normalization was the most appropriate normalization technique. \n\nThirdly, I want to statistically analyze the data. [DataFrame.corr](https:\/\/pandas.pydata.org\/pandas-docs\/stable\/generated\/pandas.DataFrame.corr.html) computes pairwise correlation of columns [10]. The default method used is [spearmans](https:\/\/statistics.laerd.com\/statistical-guides\/spearmans-rank-order-correlation-statistical-guide.php) to compute the correlation coefficient. \n\nSpearman's correlation determines the strength and direction of the monotonic relationship between your two variables rather than the strength and direction of the linear relationship between your two variables, which is what Pearson's correlation determines. A monotonic relationship is a relationship that does one of the following: (1) as the value of one variable increases, so does the value of the other variable; or (2) as the value of one variable increases, the other variable value decreases. Since we are trying to understand the trend, spearman would be the most suitable method of compute the correlation coefficient [11]. \n\nNext, I will plot the data on a graph to verify the results obtained in the third step.\n\nFinally, I will conclude with a short write up about the findings.","b4595a2c":"## Finding which pollutant does the checmical manufacturing industry correlates to the most","36e041e0":"# Reader take-aways\nI hope the reader has gotten a better understanding of air pollution and the type of air pollutants there are in the environment.

I choose to look at factors that affect air pollution as Singapore needs to take more steps to ensure that we [are able to meet air quality targets](https:\/\/www.channelnewsasia.com\/news\/singapore\/singapore-not-meeting-its-air-quality-targets-masagos-7543240) set by the World Health Organization (WHO) [1]. By identifying the root causes for problems, it would help the administrators develop targeted policies to directly address these issues.\n\nAccording to the [National Environment Agency](https:\/\/www.nea.gov.sg\/our-services\/pollution-control\/air-pollution\/air-quality) (NEA), Singapore enjoys better air quality than many cities in Asia, comparable with that of cities in the United States and Europe. Singapore\u2019s Pollutant Standards Index (PSI) has remained in the \u2018Good\u2019 and 'Moderate' range for much of 2017 [2].\n\nThe main sources of air pollution in Singapore are emissions from the manufacturing industries and motor vehicles. However, we will not only look at the vehicle population data and manufacturing industries data but we will also try to identify a relation between commercial and residential development and air pollution. I choose to include the latter as I feel that Singapore constantly has on-going construction project and I would like to understand if this affects the environment. ","dc992a27":"## Hypothesis 1 conclusion\nStudying the statistical data closely, we can conclude that the electronics industry has a 86% similarity with the carbon monoxide pollution and the chemical industry has a 82% similarity with the ozone pollution. To supplement this observtion, we can also see from the graphs that the variables are closely related.\n\nTherefore, I can conclude that there is **sufficient** evidence to support my first hypothesis claim; an increase in the output of manufacturing would lead to an increase in pollution in Singapore.","31e8c49a":"## Plotting the electronics manufacturing industry VS Carbon monoxide pollution graph","ed6b358a":"This data is sourced and managed by the Economic Development Board on the data.gov.sg website.

For this section, I will only be looking at the under construction data for HDB, Emporiums and Supermarkets and Shops, Lock-Up Shops and Eating Houses. The reason why I choose HDB for housing is because [80%](https:\/\/www.hdb.gov.sg\/cs\/infoweb\/about-us\/our-role\/public-housing--a-singapore-icon) of Singaporeans live in HDBs [14]. For commercial development, I chose to study Emporiums and Supermarkets and Shops, Lock-Up Shops and Eating Houses. This is because, according to the data we have, these two categories are the most commonly developed commercial developments in Singapore. In addition, these are the only two categories that has all the data for the selected time period.","4994a031":"# Experiment conclusion\nOne of the main reasons I want to enter the data science industry is that, as seen from this experiment, data science allows us to find relations between subjects that seem unrelated and will help us find meaning in data. This experiment has helped us identify what type of pollutants Singapore's 2 biggest manufacturing industries release into the environment; carbon monoxide and ozone. It has also given us some insight about pollution released by the residencial and commercial development in Singapore and the vehicle population in Singapore. \n\nThankfully, Singapore aims to become a [car-lite socitey](https:\/\/www.todayonline.com\/singapore\/getting-singaporeans-embrace-car-lite-society) by 2040 [19]. This means that the vehicle population will be significatly reduced. However, more work has to be done to find clean alternatives to residencial and commercial development and the various manufacturing industries in Singapore.","f28f3346":"## Joining the dataframes together","c6ee0279":"This data has 777 data points and has a very large standard deviation as it contains the information from many different industries and some industries have much lower production output as others.

","1d674d79":"It can be seen that all data has 16 data points except for PM 2.5 which has 13.

Please note that all the data used here can be found at the end of this document; in the annex.\n\nThe hypotheses that I am trying to test are as follows: \n1.  An increase in the output of manufacturing would lead to an increase in pollution in Singapore\n2. An increase in the rate of development of commercial and housing development would lead to an increase in pollution in Singapore\n3. An increase in vehicle population would lead to an increase in pollution in Singapore\n\nIn addition, I would also like to identify which pollutant do these industries largely contribute to.
