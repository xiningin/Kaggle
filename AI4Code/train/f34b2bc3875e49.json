We can see that we also have a few 70+ people in the survey. It's just fascinatinng to see users from such diverse age groups.","6ebadcb0":"# TYPES OF MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS\n---","06ce7f8e":"Looking at the number of Python developers that we have, Jupyter has to be the go to IDE for the developers. We also have VSCode and PyCharm followed by R studio. I personally use mostly Jupyter notebooks but VSCode it is when i am not using Jupyter.","da48a613":"From the above graph we can say that Python is by far the most used language of Kaggl users. I didn't expect SQL to be used by so many people, even surpassing R but i guess the industry still needs SQL developers.","ac8a0e6c":"With this i conclude my analysis of the Kaggle 2020 Survey. It was a very diverse data for users to work with and one of the most fun Kaggle competitions. I might add some plotly graphs too sometime in the future to make the notebook more interactive. Untill then, this is the final notebook.","2da5324c":"We can see the similar trend with our line plot as well. Most of the users fall in the age group of\n25-29 years of age , followed by 18-21 years old and from there as the ages go up, the number of users start to fall.","3cb4cca3":"# PLATFORMS TO LEARN DATA SCIENCE\n---","3e339250":"# SUGGESTIONS\n---","60c04c47":"The above graph gives us a much better idea of the employment distribution in these different age groups. We can also see the distribution of the employment in the different Genders as well.","1ec6e174":"# GENDER\n---","c3ac6694":"Most Kaggle users preffered using GPUs to in their workflow to be more productive and efficient.","4b898200":"As we saw, most Kaggle Users are students, these might be Ph.D students, Bachelor's or even some other Professional Degree. Followed by these we have Data scientists and software engineers. I expected the number of Data scientists and Machine learning engineers to be close to each other but the difference seems to be quite significant.","19d47192":"Most people fall in data have been either coding for 3-5 years or for 1-2 years. These numbers are quite common. It's very interesting to see people who have never written any code, still being part of Kaggle which shows that people are eager to learn stuff and Kaggle is helping them in their journey.","dbbea88d":"Let's take a look at the IDEs these developers use.","7fe0f23f":"From the above results we can see there are a good amount of people who are really experienced and there aare also people who have just started stating that Kaggle is a Website for everyone!","3547e8e2":"# EMPLOYMENT\n---","03e111dd":"We can see most of the users are in the age group of 25-29 years followed by 22-24 and 18-21. This means the most of the working professionals are more active on Kaggle as compared to the students.","0883e782":"# IDE\n---","2a9b40e6":"# PLATFORMS FOR SHARING WORK\n---","a51b82a3":"So now we know that most of the Kaggle users are Male students followed by Male Data scientists. We also have a good amount of Software engineers in the data meaning that transitioning from Software development to Data Science isn't tough or impossible, it just depends on a person's true interest.","1aadd1f8":"# KAGGLE ML & DS SURVEY ANALYSIS\n---\nThis is my analysis that i carried out using the competition data set that we were given. I tried my best to gain as many insights from the data as possible. Feel free to comment down any suggestions or remarks.","dbb1332b":"# MACHINE LEARNING FRAMEWORKS\n---","d281c920":"# PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES\n---","ef7c835f":"# EDUCATION\n---","3f21f42b":"So according to the above graph, we can say that most of the Kaggle users already have a Masters degree which justifies the analysis we did before in which we found most Kaggle users fall in the age group of 24-34 and as we can see, the next input that users gave was Bachelor's degree which consists of students between the age group of 18-24. We also have users with Doctoral degrees and some self taught people as well.","22060270":"# AGE\n---","be36d3b8":"When we check the Top 10 countries in our data where people are active on Kaggle, we can see almost 45% of the data contains Indians followed by Americans that take about 17% of the data. We also have a partition for \"other\", it might be for the countries that weren't named in the survey. It might be possible that survey takers just filled the other option beccause they weren't able to find their nation in one go, which means there is a possibility of false entries because Kaggle wont just exclude so many countries from the Survey. This is just my theory. There can be some other reason as well.","027a7228":"**Some Points to Take away from the Analysis:-**\n* Most Kaggle user's are quite young with their age between 22-29\n* The Number of Men using Kaggle is huge as compared to the Woman. But we could see a significant growth in number of female Kagglers recently.\n* Most Kaggler's are from India followed by USA and other countries.\n* Most Kagglers have a Master's Degree.\n* Majority of Kagglers are Students followed by Data Scientists and Machine Learning  Engineers.\n* Most Kagglers have Experience of 3-5 Years in the Programming and then there are Kagglers with an experience of 1-2 years.\n* Most Kagglers use Python followed by SQL and R.\n* The most Preffered IDEs are Jupyter, VScode and PyCharm.\n* Most Recommended Languages for Data Science Beginners is Python followed by R.\n* The most used data visualization Libraries are Matplotlib and Seaborn.\n* The most used framework for Machine learning and Deep learning is Sci-Kit learn followed by Tensorflow along with Keras.\n* The Most commonly used algorithms are Regression based followed by Decision trees, random forests and so on.\n* Most users share their work on Github followed by Kaggle and Colab. There are also many who dont like to share their work.\n* Most users preferred Coursera to learn Data science and Machine Learning followed by Kaggle Courses and Udemy.\n* Most users make use of Kaggle notebooks and forums to stay updated about latest Data science and ML topics followed by Youtube and Blogs on various websites.","742f6d87":"40% users have a Master's Degree and 35% have a Bachelor's. But let's appreciate those 2% people who didn't have any formal education but are still here with others working hard. And also those self taught users!","6f4bda5e":"The pie chart clearly shows how big the difference is betweent Male users and the other genders. Maybe in future we will witness a more fair distribution in the Genders column.","b5705fba":"# PLATFORMS TO STAY UPDATED\n---","f5e5ed74":"You might have heard people say, it's all regression problems in the industry. Well,the data never lies and we can see it from the above graph.","38713014":"We chose to drop the Nan entries and we will just focus on the entries that are present. ","da55a49e":"From the above graph, we can see that most users that filled the survey are Male. The difference between the Males and Other age groups is quite significant","abf15c78":"From the above graph we can say that people tend to shift from IDEs untill they find the one that suits them the best. I myself try and switch between VSCode,Jupyter and Spyder. So it varies from person to person.","138cec74":"We can see that most commonly used libraries are Matplotlib and Seaborn as most users on Kaggle use Python and these 2 work really well in Python. We also see use of Plotly and even though it's a bit tough, the interactive graphs that it provides can be very helpful.","2696ca3b":"# VISUALIZATION LIBRARIES\n---","f3693b6c":"# Taking a look at the data set\n---","9b0cb5ea":"We also had a column that consists the data of the languages suggested by Kaggle users to aspiring data scientists who are just starting their journey.","34a18184":"# USE OF SPECIALIZED HARDWARE\n---","2a831656":"When we see the above graph we can see that most students have been coding for 1-2 years and as the ages go up in number, the people with coding experience also goes up, which is how it should be.","61bfda3e":"We also chose to compare the distribution of education among the different genders. The results are exactly what we expected from the above analysis.","97d247ff":"As we can see most users use Sci-Kit learn libraries for Machine Learning tasks followed by Tensorflow and Keras. I am sure we will be seeing huge increase in number of people usingg Pytorch in the coming years as it is becoming much more famous among the Users.","eac43a10":"# COUNTRIES\n---","2da6a756":"# PROGRAMMING EXPERIENCE\n---","5a331321":"Next up, lets try and see what we can find in the Genders column.","91a23097":"From the above graph it's clear that most of the Kaggle users are from India followed by USA. The difference between Users from India and rest of the countries seems to be very huge. We will try and see the distribution using a Pie chart. Let's just take a look at the Top 10 countries to get a better idea about the column entries.","f918af2b":"Most users like to share your work on Github, followed by Kaggle and Colab. Some even write personal blogs, which is a great thing!"}}
