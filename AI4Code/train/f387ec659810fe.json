In particular, it is a challenge to design stable messenger RNA molecules. Typical vaccines are packaged in syringes and shipped under refrigeration around the world, but that is not possible for mRNA vaccines (currently).**\n\n**Researches have noticed that RNA molecules tend to spontaneously degrade, which is highly problematic because a single cut can render mRNA vaccines useless. Not much is known about which part of the backbone of a particular RNA is most susceptible to being damaged.**\n\n**Without this knowledge, the current mRNA vaccines are shopped under intense refrigeration and are unlikely to reach enough humans unless they can be stabilized. This is our task as Kagglers: we must create a model to predict the most likely degradation rates at each base of an RNA molecule.**\n\n**We are given a subset of an Eterna dataset comprised of over 3000 RNA molecules and their degradation rates at each position.

While the submission requires all 5, only 3 are scored: `reactivity`, `deg_Mg_pH10` and `deg_Mg_50C`**\n\n**The training features we are given are as follows:**\n\n* **id** - An arbitrary identifier for each sample.\n* **seq_scored** - (68 in Train and Public Test, 91 in Private Test) Integer value denoting the number of positions used in scoring with predicted values. This should match the length of `reactivity`, `deg_*` and `*_error_*` columns. Note that molecules used for the Private Test will be longer than those in the Train and Public Test data, so the size of this vector will be different.\n* **seq_length** - (107 in Train and Public Test, 130 in Private Test) Integer values, denotes the length of `sequence`. Note that molecules used for the Private Test will be longer than those in the Train and Public Test data, so the size of this vector will be different.\n* **sequence** - (1x107 string in Train and Public Test, 130 in Private Test) Describes the RNA sequence, a combination of `A`, `G`, `U`, and `C` for each sample. Should be 107 characters long, and the first 68 bases should correspond to the 68 positions specified in `seq_scored` (note: indexed starting at 0).\n* **structure** - (1x107 string in Train and Public Test, 130 in Private Test) An array of `(`, `)`, and `.` characters that describe whether a base is estimated to be paired or unpaired. Paired bases are denoted by opening and closing parentheses e.g. (....) means that base 0 is paired to base 5, and bases 1-4 are unpaired.\n* **reactivity** - (1x68 vector in Train and Public Test, 1x91 in Private Test) An array of floating point numbers, should have the same length as `seq_scored`. These numbers are reactivity values for the first 68 bases as denoted in `sequence`, and used to determine the likely secondary structure of the RNA sample.\n* **deg_pH10** - (1x68 vector in Train and Public Test, 1x91 in Private Test) An array of floating point numbers, should have the same length as `seq_scored`. These numbers are reactivity values for the first 68 bases as denoted in `sequence`, and used to determine the likelihood of degradation at the base\/linkage after incubating without magnesium at high pH (pH 10).\n* **deg_Mg_pH10** - (1x68 vector in Train and Public Test, 1x91 in Private Test) An array of floating point numbers, should have the same length as `seq_scored`. These numbers are reactivity values for the first 68 bases as denoted in `sequence`, and used to determine the likelihood of degradation at the base\/linkage after incubating with magnesium in high pH (pH 10).\n* **deg_50C** - (1x68 vector in Train and Public Test, 1x91 in Private Test) An array of floating point numbers, should have the same length as `seq_scored`. These numbers are reactivity values for the first 68 bases as denoted in `sequence`, and used to determine the likelihood of degradation at the base\/linkage after incubating without magnesium at high temperature (50 degrees Celsius).\n* **deg_Mg_50C** - (1x68 vector in Train and Public Test, 1x91 in Private Test) An array of floating point numbers, should have the same length as `seq_scored`. These numbers are reactivity values for the first 68 bases as denoted in `sequence`, and used to determine the likelihood of degradation at the base\/linkage after incubating with magnesium at high temperature (50 degrees Celsius).\n* **`*_error_*`** - An array of floating point numbers, should have the same length as the corresponding `reactivity` or `deg_*` columns, calculated errors in experimental values obtained in `reactivity` and `deg_*` columns.\n* **predicted_loop_type** - (1x107 string) Describes the structural context (also referred to as 'loop type')of each character in `sequence`. Loop types assigned by bpRNA from Vienna RNAfold 2 structure. From the bpRNA_documentation: S: paired \"Stem\" M: Multiloop I: Internal loop B: Bulge H: Hairpin loop E: dangling End X: eXternal loop","71e76078":"**Now we create a dictionary to help us map `sequence`, `structure`, and `predicted_loop_type` to columns we can feed a model:**","b6e9d5cb":"**We will use a simple learning rate callback for now:**","23f10427":"**Now we do the same for the LSTM model so we can blend their predictions:**"}}
