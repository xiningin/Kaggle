This kernel \u201cslides\u201d over the 2D input data, performing an elementwise multiplication with the part of the input it is currently on, and then summing up the results into a single output pixel. - [SOURCE- read more click here](https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/intuitively-understanding-convolutions-for-deep-learning-1f6f42faee1)\n\n![A standard convolution](https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/535\/1*Zx-ZMLKab7VOCQTxdZ1OAw.gif)\n\n\nBelow is a function defining a CNN model with 3 main blocks of Convolutional layers. The first two blocks follow the same structure:\n1. Apply a Conv2D layer with 3x3 kernel size and valid padding, then another Conv2D layer with 3x3 kernel but with same padding to keep the same dimensions\n2. Apply a BatchNormalization layer to avoid layers being too depended from one another and allowing each activation to have 0 mean\n3. A RELU activation and a MaxPooling2D layer with 2x2 kernel size and stride=2\n4. An element-wise Dropout layer applied to MaxPooling2D keeping 80% of the activation units\n\nThe final 2 layers consists of a Fully Connected Layer that uses a Softmax activation for classification.","6ee0977a":"# Get trian and test data","64c0e855":"You can make verbose=0, in the code above if you dod not  want to see each step in the process","f1bfd516":"### Graphing Accuracy\n\nLet us check how our model went by graphing accuracy with validation accuracy, and our training loss with validation loss.","b7284214":"#  MNIST Classification\n\nMNIST is a Multiclass Classification project involving image recognition.
