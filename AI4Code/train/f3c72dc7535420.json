bachelor's or doctoral degree are relatively the same. However, looking at Master's degrees, there is clearly a higher percentage of women who have obtained Master's degrees then men. This does not support the idea that lack of education contributes to the wage gap seen previously.","4d2621de":"# Conclusion","274821f7":"## Income and Gender","627e7015":"Overall, we can conclude that the data science industry in the United States is mainly dominated by men. Although it seems like other genders might be making a breakthrough into the industry, it does not look like there will be a significant rush of other genders taking data science positions any time soon. We also explored the posibility of a wage gap, and saw that with similar job titles, and equivalent or more education than men, women make less then men do in this industry. Even with the advantage of more coding experience for men over women, this should not have such a large affect on income like was shown in this analysis. In a field that is open to the possibility of bias from things such as AI algorithms, it is important to have a diverse workforce so that everyone is represented. Corporations and universities needs to do a better job at accepting other genders into the field in order to improve diversity in the industry.","5d5a1d10":"Most respondents to the survey in the United States seem to be in their late 20's or early 30's. There is also a large majority of men who completed the survey. It might be interesting to see what the percentage is of each gender that completed the survey in each age group to see if we can spot any trends.","397fdb00":"## Read in Data","d11df43c":"The most popular job titles for both men and women are extremely similiar. The top 3 for both men and women are data scientist, student and other. Data analyst and research scientist are also both in the top 6 most popular job titles for men and women. With mostly the same job titles, it is curious as to why there is such a big difference in pay between men and women. Perhaps showing signs of a wage gap, but it is still necessary to take into account that student is a much more popular title for women than for men, which likely plays at least a small role in the wage gap shown by this survey, as students are much more likely to make less money. The title \"Other\" is also ambiguous and does not give us much information as to what the job is. We can also take a look at education to see if there are differences in education between men and women, which might help to explain the wage gap.","a5c926bb":"For each age group, a majority of respondents to the survey are men. This could perhaps be a consquence of a lack of diversity in the data science industry in the United States. However, it looks like the percentage of men in each age group is decreasing with younger age groups, while the percentage of women is increasing. Other genders still have very low representation in each age group. This is perhaps a sign that representation of other genders besides men is increasing in the data science industry, albeit at a slow pace.","41fb70a2":"## Gender and Experience","7fe699d1":"Men seem to have more experience programming them women do based on this survey. This could play a factor into why men recieve more pay than woman, but it likely does not make a big difference since there are still a large percentage of women with a good amount of coding experience.","2bda86be":"## Age and Gender of Survey Respondents","08a69098":"# An Analysis of Gender in the Data Science Industry in the United States","6c5ee600":"## Gender and Job Title","8c166490":"Men seem to have almost a complete majority of the higher paying jobs in the industry. There is a clear decrease in the percentage of men in an income bracket as the income drops, and a clear increase in the percentage of woman working in a specific income bracket as income drops."}}
