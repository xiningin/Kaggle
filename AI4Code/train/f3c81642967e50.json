For example, if a query is formed that scans all of the data in a particular column, given how large BigQuery datasets are it wouldn't be too surprising if it burns through a large chunk of that monthly quota!\n\nFortunately, the bq_helper module gives us tools to very easily estimate the size of our queries before running a query. Start by drafting up a query using BigQuery's Standard SQL syntax. Next, call the estimate_query_size function which will return the size of the query in GB. That way you can get a sense of how much data is being scanned before actually running your query."}}
