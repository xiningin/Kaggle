LASSO is an acronym form Least Absolute selection and Shrinkage Operator. The Lasso imposes a constraint on the sum of the absolute values of the model parameters where the sum has a specified constant as an upper bound. This constraint causes regression coefficients for some variables to shrink towards zero. The shrinkage process identifies the variables most strongly associated with the response variable. The goal is to obtain the subset of predictors that minimized the prediction error.

High bias can cause an algorithm to miss the relevant relations between features and target outputs (underfitting).The **variance** is an error from sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training set. High variance can cause an algorithm to model the random noise in the training data, rather than the intended outputs (overfitting).

Drop a line!","f3e1f829":"## Pearson Correlation\n\nTo see how each variable is correlated to the other we are gonna use the Pearson Correlation Coeficient. This is a measure of the linear correlation between two variables X and Y. It has a value between +1 and \u22121, where 1 is total positive linear correlation, 0 is no linear correlation, and \u22121 is total negative linear correlation. \n![texto alternativo](https:\/\/www.examspm.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Screen-Shot-2016-07-11-at-11.32.46-AM.png)\n\nFor any more information refer to [Pearson Correlation Coefficient](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pearson_correlation_coefficient)\n\n","06f30f4c":"## AdaBoost Algorithm\n\nAdaBoost stands for Adaptive Boosting. When we mention boosting we refer to  aggregate a set of weak classifiers into a strong classifier.  It is adaptive in the sense that classifiers that come in next for execution are adjusted according to those instances that were wrongly classified width the previous classifiers. You could say that by just focusing on the training data samples misclassified by the previous weak classifier, each weak classifier contributes its bit the best it can  to improve the overall classification rate.  AdaBoost calls the weak classifiers repeatedly, performing a series of  $t = 1,...,T$  classifiers. In each execution, \"weight\" calculated by incorrectly classified examples increases (or, alternatively, weights of each correctly classified examples decreases). New classifiers are constrained to focus on those examples that were incorrectly classified by previous classifiers. \n\n### Disadvantages\n\n- It is sensitive to noisy data and information that doesn't belong to the required set\n\n\n### Advantagess\n\n- in some situations, this algorithm may be less susceptible to memory input set in comparison to many other algorithms\n\n### Basic Idea \n\n1- Take lots of (possibly) weak predictors\n\n2- Weight them and add them up\n\n3- Get a stronger predictor\n\n\n\n**First** : Initialize the weight of each observation to $W_i =\\frac { 1}{N} .$ For $ t $ in 1 to T do the following.\n\n1- Using the weights, learn model $h_t(x_i) : X \\rightarrow [0,1] $\n\n2- Compute $ \\epsilon =\\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i^t | y_i \u2212h_t (x_i )|  $ as the error for $h_t$\n\n3- Let $ \\beta_{t} = \\frac{\\epsilon_{t}}{1 - \\epsilon_{t}} $ and update the weights  of each of the observations  as $ w_i ^{(t+1)} = w_i^{(t)}\\beta_{t}^{1-|y_i -h_t(x_i)|}  $ This scheme increases the weights of observations poorly  predicted by $h_t$ \n\n4- Normalize $ w^{t+1} $ so that they sum to one\n","c768b8e6":"### References\n\n- [OLS Coefficients ](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=EL-tayJzK7M)\n- [Linear Regression](https:\/\/bookdown.org\/sbikienga\/Intro_to_stat_book\/introduction-to-simple-linear-regression.html)\n*   [Lasso and Ridge Regression](http:\/\/perso-etis.ensea.fr\/tzompanaki\/ML\/regression.pdf)\n*   [Understanding Bias Variance tradeoff](http:\/\/scott.fortmann-roe.com\/docs\/BiasVariance.html)\n*   [Ridge Regression](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=5asL5Eq2x0A)\n*   [Curve fitting](https:\/\/www.essie.ufl.edu\/~kgurl\/Classes\/Lect3421\/Fall_01\/NM5_curve_f01.pdf)\n*   [Adaboost](https:\/\/engineering.purdue.edu\/kak\/Tutorials\/AdaBoost.pdf)\n*   [Others criterion](http:\/\/adataanalyst.com\/machine-learning\/guide-for-linear-regression-using-python-part-2\/)\n\n"}}
