These devices are in fact able to exchange small amounts of money with each other, in an immediate and possible way without forcing the manufacturers to compromise in design and hardware equipment. Precisely for this purpose IOTA was conceived, which however is also considered necessary for any other scenario in which there is need to manage microtransactions in addition to the IoT.","716c3d92":"# 4.
