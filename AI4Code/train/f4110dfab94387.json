(Indeed, another kaggler who tried using an autoencoder to reduce the dimensionality of the problem and found no joy).\n\n## Plotting features and target\n\nNext, I'll poke around a bit and examine the possible relationships between features and the target using the same 12 randomly-selected features.

This is analogous to setting the size of the zero \"spike\" in the spike-and-slab model, essentially capturing how many of the features we think might actually be useful.\n\nReading around on the forums, most people seem to suspect that there are actually very few meaningful variables. Informally inspecting my loess plots above suggest a similar conclusion. So for starters, let's imagine that only 10% of variables are likely to be meaningful. We could approximate that with a cauchy scale parameter of .0175, which would give us a reasonable prior for our model.","ebff16da":"To hedge bets further, we can also generate predictions using model averaging, averaging over the models that seemed reasonable.","8f50c8ff":"I've looked through a number of random feature plots like this and tried to get a sense of the relationships. Most features seem more-or-less unrelated to the target. Among those with potentially meaningful relationsips, some appeared linear and some appeared potentially non-linear. The original challenge was solvable by a hyperplane, so a non-linear answer seems like a logical next step for the challenge creators. I'll comment more on that below (in the \"appendix\"), but for now I will stick to looking for a linear solution.\n","0b2642ab":"# Introduction\n\nThis competition asks us to build a model of k = 300 features with only N = 250 observations. This resembles the situation often faced by scientists in the real world: we have limited observations and many possible explanations. \n\nIn a normal scientific context, we could use domain knowledge to help navigate this situation: we would likely know something about these variables' meanings, the accuracy with which they are measured, their temporal orderings, or best of all, their causal relationships.  But, here we have a purely _data science_ context. We have no domain knowledge about these features at all, so we have only our data-science tools to help sort out this mess.\n\nFirst, I'll get my environment ready, load the data, and define some custom helper functions.","5462bb23":"# Results\n\nFinally, I'll generate predictions for the leaderboard for all these models.\n","b23c34c8":"We could stick with that, which would be a sort of \"proper\" Bayesian way to do things, where that prior would really represent our subjective beliefs about the likely coefficient values. But, to be fair, I formed these prior beliefs in a pretty causal way---I wouldn't necessarily go to the mat for them.\n\nSo instead, we could treat the prior as a tuneable parameter, and use a measure of model performance to select the \"best\" cauchy scale parameter value for our model. \n\n## Model Comparison\n\nCross validation is a bit tricky with so little data, and mcmc methods are a bit slow to fit. So instead I'll use LOO, a Bayesian approximation of Leave-One-Out cross-validation, to assess different models' performance. I'll perform a search in the region of parameter values around our best initial guess of .0175. I'll look at parameters from .01 to .05 and I'll also throw in .10 to illustrate what a more extreme value does to things.\n\nI should acknowledge and point interested readers to Richard McElreath and his amazing book, [Statistical Rethinking](https:\/\/xcelab.net\/rm\/statistical-rethinking\/), which greatly informs this approach.","35b820f4":"\n----------------------------------------\n\n# Appendix\n\nTo me, the spirit of this competition is broken if you test too much based on submissions to the public leaderboard. Still, it's interesting to get feedback on how different approaches are working, and whether the methods deployed to compare models are translating properly into the real world.\n\n## Non-linearities?\n\nI still have some suspicions there could be non-linear relationships in the dataset. I believe the last verion of this contest was solvable with a hyperplane, so a natural extension for this second version would be to add non-linear relationships. \n\nBelow I've picked out 10 candidates I observed for non-linear relationships, plus 65 and 33, two feaures that others have found to have strong linear relationships. If they really are non-linear, I think most of these could be captured by a 3rd-order polynomial.","34f2e549":"How did we do? I've tested some of these models on the public leaderboard.

Because we have more predictor features than observations, even a simple classifier like logistic regression will have too much variance and will overfit (indeed, it will have no unique solutions). So to overcome this, we need to induce some bias.\n\nI'm going to take a Bayesian approach, inducing bias with strong priors. Specifically, I'm going to use a Bayesian logistic regression classifier to predict the targets, implementing the Bayesian inference using [PyMC3](https:\/\/docs.pymc.io\/). Because we have more features than observations, I'm going to place a strongly skeptical, or regularizing, prior over the coefficients of the model. Another example of this approach can be found in the [Bayesian Spike-and-Slab in PyMC3](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/melondonkey\/bayesian-spike-and-slab-in-pymc3) kernel. A spike-and-slab prior embodies the idea that only a small subset of the features are meaningful, so that most coefficients should be set to zero. To do this, it combines a \"spike\" at zero with a \"slab\" acros all other coefficient values. \n\nAn issue with the spike-and-slab prior is that it relies on discrete parameter values (binary variable indicating presence\/absence of each coefficient), which prevents us from using the superior NUTS sampler in PyMC3. So intead, I'm going to employ a continuous analogue to the spike-and-slab model by using a [Cauchy](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cauchy_distribution) prior. Keeping things continuous will allow the use of the NUTS sampler in PyMC3 (and would also allow this to be implemented in Stan).\n\nBelow is the specification of the model in PyMC3, wrapped in a function to create the model.","71bc04f8":"Despite these plots, I've played around with adding polynomial terms to the model but never had any success improving leaderboard scores. I just don't think there's enough data to fit these more complex models. \n\nStill, leaving the PyMC3 model here for posterity.","b56d4eb5":"These LOO values need to be taken with a grain of salt: according to LOO the best model is one using a cauchy scale paramter of .10, a model that is completely overfit with an ROCAUC of 1.0. The `shape_warn` column indicates that LOO is having issues with all these models, which is all the more reason to be cautious. If we had more data and more time, we should use k-fold cross validation instead of LOO.\n\nIn addition to the LOO score for each model, we can see the effects of regularization in the pLOO value, our measure of model complexity. We can interpret this value as the effective number of parameters in our model. Consider the model with $\\gamma$ = .025: although the model has 301 parameter values (300 betas + 1 alpha), our use of a strong prior makes the model only as flexible as if it had ~50 parameters.\n\nBelow I'm going to throw out the two clearly overfit models ($\\gamma$ =.10 and .05) and compare the remaining plausible models.","546b3b1e":"Looking at the difference in LOO scores (dLOO) and the standard error of the difference (dSE), we see that the model with $\\gamma$ = .03 model isn't appreciably worse than the model with scale parameter .04 (less than standard error difference) and the $\\gamma$ = .025 model is borderline. But, the .0175 model we started with is coming up as worse than the $\\gamma$ =.04 model. Being somewhat conservative, and considering that AUCROC indicates overfitting for all models, the $\\gamma$ = .025 or .03 models might be reasonable solutions. \n\nLet's inspect the $\\gamma$ = .025 model.","73497ccb":"## Inspecting coefficients\n\nLet's see which coefficients are in our model are largest and\/or confidently non-zero. I'll pull out the coefficients and sort them by their posterior mean. I'll also identify the coefficients for which the highest posterior density does not include zero. I'm using a 90% HPDI, but that's arbitrary.\n","a9756902":"Then, I'll plot the top 20 coefficients' loess curves in logit space for visual inspection. Features 33 and 65 are the strongest features (consistent with what others have found) and that's pretty evident from the plots."}}
