It aims to do both things without substantial compromises in ease of use, flexibility, or performance.\n>\n> -- <cite>[About Fastai](https:\/\/docs.fast.ai\/#About-fastai)<\/cite>\n\nBasically it's a library that allows both beginner and advanced deep learning practitioners to produce the best result possible with very few lines of codes.\n\n\n### About the dataset <a name=\"gtsrb-dataset\"><\/a>\n\nThe German Traffic Sign Benchmark (GTSRB) is a multi-class single-image classification dataset that was use during a challenge held at the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) in 2011.  \nThe dataset has 43 classes and a little more than 50,000 images.\n\nPlease note that we are using the updated version of the dataset.  \nThe 2011 version of the data has some flaws which are fixed in the final version.\n\nThe original dataset is on the [INI Benchmark Website](http:\/\/benchmark.ini.rub.de\/)\n\n\n# Library <a name=\"library\"><\/a>\n\n### Fastai installation <a name=\"installation\"><\/a>\n\nSince fastai is already installed in kaggle notebooks, you don't need to install it again.  \nHowever, if it's missing in your notebook, you can run the below command to intall it.\n\n```\n!pip install fastai\n```\n\n### Import Libraries <a name=\"librairies\"><\/a>\n\nIn normal python code `import *` is not recommended. But in fastai things are so optimized that it allows you to import everything you need to tackle your problem without slowing things down.","82414336":"### Visualize target class <a name=\"target-class\"><\/a>\n\nTo better understand the target class it might help to see what the traffic sign should look like.","1e1f0058":"### Interpret the results <a name=\"interpretation\"><\/a>","31a1ddb9":"Let's inspect our training data.","3f9b7518":"We also need to inspect the validation set.\n\n**N.B.**: One thing that is noticeable is that some images in the data are quite dark. My guess is that the model might struggle with these one. In the real world the lights from the car can help make the signs more visible at the night.","9027c685":"Luckily, **fastai** provides a helper function that will allow us to take a look at the categories that are the most confused.\n\nThe returned list is presented as: **actual \/ predicted \/ # of occurences**.","8c9ab5cf":"### Visualize real images for each class <a name=\"visualize-images-per-class\"><\/a>\n\nNow that we have a visual representation of each class, less see how each of them look like in our dataset.","eadd9def":"### Inspect target class distribution <a name=\"dataset-distribution\"><\/a>\n\nThis is simply a way to give us an idea of how many samples each class has in the training data. This helps answer the question: how much of each class our model will learn from?","5d873836":"### Is 99% accuracy enough for real world usage? <a name=\"real-world-usage\"><\/a>\n\nYes and no. Yes if we have an optimal environment. This means the sign needs to be well lit and not obstructed (by an object, heavy rain or snowstorm).\n\nAlthough the model has a nearly perfect score with very poor images, we might need further testing. Possibly hooking it to a camera mounted in a car and see how it performs in different scenarios such as:\n  * **Night time**\n  * **Heavy rain**\n  * **Snow storm**\n  * **Obstructed by an object**\n  * **The car moving at high speed**\n\nWe might also need to test at which distance does the sign needs to be from a moving car for the model to give an accurate prediction. This might help set a safety threshold where the prediction is not to be trusted unless the distance is below that threshold.","e777c2b9":"### Get predictions for test data <a name=\"predict-test-data\"><\/a>\n\nThe `%%capture` magic method captures the output printed by `apply`. In this case, it's an empty new line after each prediction. We don't need that.","e06c97e8":"### Save the trained model <a name=\"save-model\"><\/a>","b9951074":"# Load and inspect your data <a name=\"load-inspect-data\"><\/a>\n\n### Convert numerical labels to human readable labels <a name=\"convert-labels\"><\/a>\n\nDue to the fact that the categories (classes) are numbers, it can be quite hard to relate to them. Let's convert them.\n\nBut before we will load the dataframe holding our data.","974fd2f3":"### The most confused <a name=\"confusion-matrix\"><\/a>\n\nIn most cases a confusion matrix helps understand why some classes are being confused with others. But in this case, there is just too many classes to make sense out of it.","82b0fb41":"# Predict unseen data <a name=\"predict-unseen-data\"><\/a>\n\n### Load test data <a name=\"test-data\"><\/a>","db77f6a9":"### Load training data <a name=\"training-data\"><a\/>\n\nWe need to use part of our training for validation purposes. Fastai already handles that by keeping aside 20% of the data as validation dataset. \nSince the images are not the same size we'll transform them to have the size 224x224 using `item_tfms`.","9239fd40":"The classes that are the most confused are among the classes where the model had the worst performances.  \nWe can possibly use data augmentation technique to improve the results, provide better images or make sure we grab the right portion of the image for our training.\n\nContrary to what we thought at the beginning, none of the `less_represented` classes are part of the `most_confused` thanks to transfert learning. With transfert learning we can have very few number of sample and still achieve great results.  \nThis also means that it's not only about the quantity of the samples but quality of it.\n\n\n### Can a human do better on wrong predictions? <a name=\"can-human-do-better\"><\/a>\n\nGiven this dataset, a short answer is **No**.\n\nFor many of the images where the model had it wrong, it will be difficult for the naked eye to recognize the sign due to the darkness of the image.\n\n\n### Predict using trained model <a name=\"test-prediction\"><\/a>","bbf0036b":"### Test data accuracy <a name=\"test-data-accuracy\"><\/a>"}}
