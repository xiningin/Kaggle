L. GINSBERG - New York\n\n\"It is a matter of common knowledge that the prophet Ezekiel (Ezek. xiv 14, 20) names Noah, Daniel, and Job as classical types of piety, and that whereas what is told about a person by the name of Job in Job i-ii; xlii 7-17 is very much the sort of thing one would expect to read about a classical saint most of what is told about hirn in the rest of the Book of Job is not exactly what we should expect to read about a paragon of saintliness. The particular virtue of the hero of the framework of the Book of Job is unflinching loyalty to God under unimaginably severe trials or, in the phrase which \nthe King James Version of the Epistle of James v 11 has made a household ward wherever English is spoken, \"the patience of Job\". Building on this phrase we may say that there are two main strata in the Book of Job: the Book of Job the Patient, or JP; and the Book of Job the Impatient, or JIP.\"\n\nJOB THE PATIENT (JP) \n\n\"As regards JP, there is general agreement about its nature and import and disagreement only ab out its extent. In the case of JIP, on the other hand, there is even more disagreement on its interpretation than on its delimitation. In all these controversies, I find mys elf in opposition to the two full length commentaries on the Book of Job to which Bible scholarship gave birth in the middle sixties of the current century 1). But whereas I shall have relatively little to say that is original on the JP controversy, my position here being essentially the neglected view of a predecessor, in the case of JIP I shall-though again leaning heavily on a predecessor exercise more selectivity and make what I trust will be judged rather important contributions of my own. On the extent of JP, we may distinguish a minimalist, a medialist\"\n\n G. FOHRER, Das Buch Hiob (Kommentar zum Alten Testament, Band XVI), \n1963, pp. 568; M. H.
