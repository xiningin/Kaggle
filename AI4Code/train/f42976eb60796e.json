The first two blocks follow the same structure:\n1. Apply a Conv2D layer with 3x3 kernel size and valid padding, then another Conv2D layer with 3x3 kernel but with same padding to keep the same dimensions\n2. Apply a BatchNormalization layer to avoid layers being too depended from one another and allowing each activation to have 0 mean\n3. A RELU activation and a MaxPooling2D layer with 2x2 kernel size and stride=2\n4. An element-wise Dropout layer applied to MaxPooling2D keeping 80% of the activation units\n\nThe final 2 layers consists of a Fully Connected Layer that uses a Softmax activation for classification.","d7d964b3":"You can try different models- Resnet or Efficientnet and see how they work!\n\nHere is a link to my model on multiclass classification of Human Protiens which was in the top 4% in the in-class competition\nThis uses CNN,  Resnet34,  Resnet50 and Resnet101 : [Human Protein Classification (top 4%) : PyTorch](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/kmldas\/human-protein-classification-top-4-pytorch)\n","cf1b1617":"# Acknowledgement, Sources and Suggestions\n\n\n\n\nkernel by Chris: https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/christianwallenwein\/beginners-guide-to-mnist-with-fast-ai\n\nkernel by Timothy: https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/susantotm\/digit-recognizer\n\nkernel by Yassine: https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/yassineghouzam\/introduction-to-cnn-keras-0-997-top-6\n\ncan you use FASTAI to do this faster?\nhttps:\/\/www.fast.ai\n\nLook at my colab notenook on using 5 lines of code in FASTAI to get similar results! \nhttps:\/\/colab.research.google.com\/drive\/1tuKzXuWgYuJVa83k6NiL0GVKy_hyJJni?usp=sharing (link updated for viewing only- Pls copy to own colab\/download to run.
