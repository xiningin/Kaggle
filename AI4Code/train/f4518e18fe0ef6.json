Pre pruning techniques\n\nPre pruning is nothing but stoping the growth of decision tree on an early stage. For that we can limit the growth of trees by setting constrains. We can limit parameters like *max_depth* , *min_samples* etc.\n\nAn effective way to do is that we can grid search those parameters and choose the optimum values that gives better performace on test data. ","d2da006a":"As of now we will control these parameters\n* max_depth: maximum depth of decision tree\n* min_sample_split: The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node:\n* min_samples_leaf: The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node.","88ec695c":"We can see that the size of decision tree significantly got reduced.

The classic issue is over-fitting versus under-fitting. Over-fitting happens when a model fits on training data so well and it fails to generalize well.ie, it also learns noises on top of the signal. Under-fitting is an opposite event: the model is too simple to find the patterns in the data. \n\n[Decision trees](https:\/\/medium.com\/datadriveninvestor\/decision-tree-algorithm-with-hands-on-example-e6c2afb40d38) are extremly popular and useful model in machine learning. But it can easily get overfit. Pruning is one of the mainly used technique to avoid\/overcome overfitting. In this kernal we will discuss about 2 commonly used pruning types.\n\n<br>\n\n***1.

Cost complexity pruning is one of the important among them.\n\n## Cost Complexity Pruning\n\n\nDecision trees can easily overfit. One way to avoid it is to limit the growth of trees by setting constrains. We can limit parameters like *max_depth* , *min_samples* etc. But a most effective way is to use post pruning methods like cost complexity pruning. This helps to improve test accuracy and get a better model.\n\nCost complexity pruning is all about finding the right parameter for **alpha**.We will get the alpha values for this tree and will check the accuracy with the pruned trees.\n\n\nTo know more about cost complexity pruning watch [this vedio from Josh Starmer.](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=D0efHEJsfHo&list=PLblh5JKOoLUICTaGLRoHQDuF_7q2GfuJF&index=41)\n\n\n","be3350a3":"> \n\nWe will remove the last element in clfs and ccp_alphas, because it is the trivial tree with only one node.\n","1269cad1":"Observation: As alpha increases no of nodes and depth decreases"}}
