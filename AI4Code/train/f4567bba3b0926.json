Here's your coding interview problem for today.\n\nThis problem was asked by Microsoft.Daily Coding Problem: Problem #903\n\nGiven an array of numbers and a number k, determine if there are three entries in the array which add up to the specified number k. For example, given [20, 303, 3, 4, 25] and k = 49, return true as 20 + 4 + 25 = 49"}}
