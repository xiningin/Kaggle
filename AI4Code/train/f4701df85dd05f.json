Observed values above the mean have positive standard scores, while values below the mean have negative standard scores. Standard Score is a very useful statistic because it (a) allows us to calculate the probability of a score occurring within our normal distribution and (b) enables us to compare two scores that are from different normal distributions.\n    \n    It is calculated by subtracting the population mean from an individual raw score and then dividing the difference by the population standard deviation. It is a dimensionless quantity. This conversion process is called standardizing or normalizing.\n\n    Standard scores are also called z-values, z-scores, normal scores, and standardized variables.\n    Computing a z-score requires knowing the mean and standard deviation of the complete population to which a data point belongs; if one only has a sample of observations from the population, then the analogous computation with sample mean and sample standard deviation yields the t-statistic.","2d954675":"So in the above result,\n\n    25% is our Q1\n    50% is our median\n    75% is our Q3\n    std is our Standard Deviation, the average distance our data points fall from our mean value.\n    count is our sample size.\n    Q3 - Q1 will give you IQR and sometimes a better way to let know where exactly our data is falling.\n    The Range is less robust to outliers and sometimes may not give you where most of our data falls, whereas IQR will give you that.
