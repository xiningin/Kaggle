Each cell is either text or Python code.\n- To run a cell of code, click the \"play button\" icon to the left of the cell or click on the cell and press \"Shift+Enter\" on your keyboard. This will execute the Python code contained in the cell. Executing a cell that defines a variable is important before executing or authoring a cell that depends on that previously created variable assignment.\n- **Expect to see lots of errors** the first time you load this page. \n- **Expect to see lots of errors** for all cells run without code that matches the assertion tests.\n- Until you click the blue \"Copy and Edit\" button to make your own copy, you will see an entire page of errors. This is part of the automated tests.\n- Each *assert* line is both an example and a test that tests for the presence and functionality of the instructed exercise. \n\n## The only 3 conditions that produce no errors:\n1. When you make a fresh **copy** of the project to your own account (by clicking \"Copy and Edit\")\n2. When you go to \"Run\" and then click \"Restart Session\"\n3. When every single assertion passes.\n\n\n## Outline\n- Each cell starts with a problem statement that describes the exercise to complete.\n- Underneath each problem statement, learners will need to write code to produce an answer.\n- The **assert** lines test to see that your code solves the problem appropriately\n- Many exercises will rely on previous solutions to be correctly completed\n- The `print(\"Exercise is complete\")` line will only run if your solution passes the assertion test(s)\n- Be sure to create programmatic solutions that will work for all inputs:\n- For example, calling the `is_even(2)` returns `True`, but your function should work for all even numbers, both positive and negative.\n\n\n## Guidance\n- Get Python to do the work for you. For example, if the exercise instructs you to reverse a list of numbers, your job is to find the \n- Save often by clicking the blue \"Save\" button.\n- If you need to clear the output or reset the notebook, go to \"Run\" then \"Restart Session\" to clear up any error messages.\n- Do not move or alter the lines of code that contain the `assert` statements. Those are what run your solution and test its actual output vs. expected outputs.\n- Seek to understand the problem before trying to solve it. Can you explain the problem to someone else in English? Can you explain the solution in English?\n- Slow down and read any error messages you encounter. Error messages provide insight into how to resolve the error. When in doubt, put your exact error into a search engine and look for results that reference an identical or similar problem.\n\n## Get Python To Do The Work For You\nOne of the main jobs of a programming language is to help people solve problems programatically, so we don't have to do so much by hand. For example, it's easy for a person to manually reverse the list `[1, 2, 3]`, but imagine reversing a list of a million things or sorting a list of even a hundred things. When we write programmatic solutions in code, we are providing instructions to the computer to do a task. Computers follow the letter of the code, not the intent, and do exactly what they are told to do. In this way, Python can reverse a list of 3 numbers or 100 numbers or ten million numbers with the same instructions. Repetition is a key idea behind programming languages.\n\nThis means that your task with these exercises is to determine a sequence of steps that solve the problem and then find the Python code that will run those instructions. If you're sorting or reversing things by hand, you're not doing it right!\n\n## How To Discover How To Do Something in Python\n1. The first step is to make sure you know what the problem is asking.\n2. The second step is to determine, in English (or your first spoken language), what steps you need to take.\n3. Use a search engine to look for code examples to identical or similar problems.\n\nOne of the best ways to discover how to do things in Python is to use a search engine. Go to your favorite search engine and search for \"how to reverse a list in Python\" or \"how to sort a list in Python\". That's how both learners and professionals find answers and examples all the time. Search for what you want and add \"in Python\" and you'll get lots of code examples. Searching for \"How to sum a list of numbers in Python\" is a very effective way to discover exactly how to do that task.","376c8695":"## Working with Lists of Dictionaries\n**Hint** If you need an example of lists of dictionaries, see [https:\/\/gist.github.com\/ryanorsinger\/fce8154028a924c1073eac24c7c3f409](https:\/\/gist.github.com\/ryanorsinger\/fce8154028a924c1073eac24c7c3f409)","bd9bea86":"## Accessing List Elements","17cd3a43":"## Applying functions to lists","93111d00":"## Getting Started\n0.
