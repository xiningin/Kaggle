We should be careful if there will be many caculations that demand finer details that float64 provides. EXAMPLE: feature.astype(np.float16). Objects and float64 seems to eat up memory and cause \"allocating too much memory\" crashes.\n* Numpy functions on rolling windows: I do a technique to make the rolling window mean and std calculations fast. I think it calculates all the windows at once in parallel or something. But this std will use too much ram very easily. Therefore I had to do batches of size 10. Even with this, the RAM almost maxes out when calculating the standard deviation of the 180 sized window. Keep this in mind when using other numpy functions, custom functions, or window sizes for calculations. ","28289062":"# Module of functions"}}
