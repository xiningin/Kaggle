People like: Andrew Ng, Yann LeCun, Yoshua Bengio influenced thousands in this new sourcery. Their energy, passion, vision show the path and open new areas for exploration.\n\nThousand of followers from different countries and ages started this magnificent journey to unveal answears of important questions like:\n* How did life begin?\n* Are we alone in the universe?\n* What is consciousness, intelligence?\n* Can we live for ever?\n* How do we beat bacteria?\n\nLets have a look on the countries and how they are presented in Kaggle - which is advertised as \"Your Home for Data Science\":","60dfa51f":"#### 2.1.2 How to investigate chaotic the data","d1b21347":"# 2.

The same was in the past and the same will be in the future. In order to understand how data change history of humanity we can have a look on some of the most important events in human history related to bad data:\n* **Columbus\u2019s Geographical Miscalculations** - Taken together, the two miscalculations effectively reduced the planetary waistline to 16,305 nautical miles, down from the actual 21,600 or so, an error of 25 percent.

The software calculated the force that the thrusters needed to exert in pounds of force. A second piece of code that read this data assumed it was in the metric unit\u2014\u201cnewtons per square meter\u201d.

And about 2019 and community of data scientist? Does Data-science community produce better quality data now. Lets look on the free text response below:","830c0cd7":"# 1.3 Participants vs Kaggle visitors vs World\n\nIn the survey about 19 K people participated which seems not bad result if we compare for example with StackOverFlow survey where about 100,000 join it. If we research the top web analytics sites we can find that Kaggle.com has 50 K up to 300 K visits daily which makes good percentage of participants. Another interesting parallel will be comparison of scientist of older times and now.\n\nFrom this map: [Global literacy today](https:\/\/ourworldindata.org\/literacy)\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/9QqeJ5d.png)\n\nBig parts of the world was illiterate in the past. Nowadays more and more people have proper education and knowledge required in the modern world. But I'll would argue and say that we are living in information era and people who don't understand data, how information travels and what benefits information brings are illiterate. \n\nSo I can find parallel with Data Science knowledge and illiteracy in the ancient times.\n\nCurrently this society represents ~ 0.0000025 from world population\n","af303b05":"# 3.

He represented the law of probability of errors by a curve and deduced a formula for the mean of three observations.\n* The method of least squares, which was used to minimize errors in data measurement, was published independently by Adrien-Marie Legendre (1805), Robert Adrain (1808), and Carl Friedrich Gauss  (1809)\n\n\n### The birth of statistics is often dated to 1662\n\n*  John Graunt, along with William Petty, developed early human statistical and census methods that provided a framework for modern demography. He produced the first life table, giving probabilities of survival to each age.
