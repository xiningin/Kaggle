E.g. \u201c\u00e9g\u201d can mean \u201csky\u201d or \u201cit is on fire\u201d or \u201cit burns\u201d (e.g. a rash) or \u201cit is lit\u201d (like a light bulb or candle). To confuse you more \u201c\u00e9g\u0151\u201d which is derived from \u201c\u00e9g\u201d can mean \u201clight bulb\u201d or \u201cburning\u201d or it can be a slang for \u201cembarassing\u201d. It is not the same as \u201c\u00e9g \u0151\u201d which could mean she\/he is on fire, burning or embarassed.\n- The phrase \u201cThe sun is shining\u201d in Hungarian is \u201cS\u00fct a nap\u201d which litteraly means \u201cThe sun is baking\u201d\n- Magyarorsz\u00e1g (Hungary) means \u201cMagyar country\u201d in accurate translation. Most of the country names have \u201corsz\u00e1g\u201d (country) in them in Hungarian. E.g. Oroszorsz\u00e1g - Russian country, N\u00e9metorsz\u00e1g - German country etc.\n- Although Hungary is a small country we still have different dialects (dialect of Budapest, Debrecen, Somogy etc.). E.g. \u201clower\u201d (as sg is at a lower location in comparison to sg else) in Hungarian can be \u201clejjebb\u201d or \u201clentebb\u201d depending on the dialect. Or the phrase \u201cwe will see\u201d can be \u201cMajd megl\u00e1tjuk\u201d (we will see) or \u201cMajd megl\u00e1tszik\u201d (it will show).\n- We use so many \u201ce\u201d-s in our language that we invented \u201cEszperente\u201d (not Esperanto!) which is a language game where you have to use words only with \u201ce\u201d in them. The strangest example is a sentence made up using only \u201ce\u201d-s and \u201ct\u201d-s: \u201cTe tetted e tettetett tettet te tettetett tettek tettese.\u201d which means \u201cYou did this pretended act, you, the doer of pretended acts.\u201d The trick of using so many \u201ce\u201d-s is that we pronounce it two ways, there is a more closed and high and a more open and low version.\n- If you learned the Hungarian alphabet you can read Hungarian or write it down as we write every word as we pronounce it. The only confusion in writing is around \u201cj\u201d and \u201cly\u201d which are both the same sound (like Y in yo-yo) and around \u201ce\u201d as indicated above in reading. There are actually a lot of Hungarians who don\u2019t know when to use \u201cly\u201d or \u201cj\u201d so don\u2019t worry if you confuse them. The \u201crule\u201d is if you can say the word with \u201cl\u201d and you get the same meaning in old Hungarian, then it is written with \u201cly\u201d (e.g. luk -lyuk, both means hole). If it has a different meaning than it is \u201cj\u201d (e.g. j\u00e1tszik which means sy is playing - l\u00e1tszik which means sg is showing).\n- Hungarians use\/write their names with family name first (like Smith John) not the other way around. Sometimes it is confusing for foreigners since we also say our name in English if we speak English. My family name for example is \u201cTancsa\u201d and I was addressed several times in emails like \u201cHi Tancsa,\u201d which is wierd but still sweet as the writer tried to be attentive. A lot of English names has their Hungarian version. E.g. John above would be called \u201cKov\u00e1cs J\u00e1nos\u201d which is actually the Hungarian version of John Doe as the most frequent name in Hungary. Some other forename examples are: Erick - Erik, Richard - Rih\u00e1rd, Henry - Henrik, Gabriel - G\u00e1briel, Tomas - Tam\u00e1s, Rachel - R\u00e1hel, Emily - Em\u00edlia, Olive - Ol\u00edvia, Anne - Anna etc.\n"}}
