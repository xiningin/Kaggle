The silhouette plot displays a measure of how close each point in one cluster is to points in the neighboring clusters and thus provides a way to assess parameters like number of clusters visually. This measure has a range of [-1, 1].\n\nSilhouette coefficients (as these values are referred to as) near +1 indicate that the sample is far away from the neighboring clusters. A value of 0 indicates that the sample is on or very close to the decision boundary between two neighboring clusters and negative values indicate that those samples might have been assigned to the wrong cluster.","1af0ca4d":"#We will use the K-means Clustering model and Elbow Method for our prediction.","84718ae3":"As observed in Silhouette plot for n_clusters=2 ,the cluster 0 is quite larger than cluster1 .So it depicts three clusteres merged into one  big cluster.So it's not a good approach.While for n_clusters=3 there is some negative area in the plot which shows some data points are wrongly assigined from cluster2 instead of cluster0.\nWith n_clusters=4 we see  homogeneous and clearly separated clusters which means  our elbow method evaluation is correct.","49155236":"#Final Outcomes","a1a9e433":"#In this notebook,I covered Validating K-Means Clustering model using Silhouette Coefficient","1c3dda16":"#Source Link\nhttps:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/auto_examples\/cluster\/plot_kmeans_silhouette_analysis.html","a62428dc":"#Validation thru  Silhouette score"}}
