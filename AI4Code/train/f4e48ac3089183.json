Introduction\n\nThis competetition have some problems with target loss mentioned above. Under this circumstances there are two ways to solve this problem:\n- Adding one layer to predict a Sigma with FVC prediction \n- Splitting challange into two easier ones: first for a FVC prediction and the second for a Sigma prediction (with calculated FVC prediction as the one of features).\n\nEach case has it's own pros and cons. First approach is easy to implement with original loss, but it's unavailable to use many of popular gradient boosting methods, cause even a custom objective require only 1D vector as output of the model. On the other side, the second method has even more sierious problem: what type of loss we have to use in each task to achieve the best result in terms of an original loss? \n\nThe next sections are about the second approach with the first task for FVC prediction and the second for Sigma one. Sigma prediction task look easier, cause in that moment delta from Laplace Loss is a constant already, loss input becomes 2D dimensinal and available to use straightforward. But FVC prediction has undefined Sigma. Choosing some particular loss like MAE or RMSE can help you to find some estimation of an exact solution, but there is no guarantee that such losses will correlate with Laplace Loss. It would be convinient to split target Laplace Loss into two losses in additional way and find FVC estimation via minimizing first item and Sigma via minimizing the second. In this terms target optimization obviously come down to two highly correlated tasks and improvement in one of this tasks with high probability will affect the target loss. So this notebook introduces one way to do that.","8753923c":"In this competition we need to optimize Laplace Log Likelihood with the next corresponding loss function:","8614ee7c":"## 4. Properties and Observations\n\nThere are some properties for better understanding Splitted Loss and observations for making sense and getting some insights:","29bb9b0d":"$$\n\\begin{cases}\n   \\sigma = \\sqrt{2} \\cdot \\Delta_{pred}, \\\\\n   \\Delta = \\Delta_{true}.\n \\end{cases}\n$$","4e81f613":"On the second part we can see an observation noticed in the section above: penalty for underrated $\\Delta_{pred}$ is bigger then for overrated one. Moreover, bigger $\\Delta_{true}$ stronger penalty for underrated $\\Delta_{pred}$ could be. On the other hand, penalty for overrated $\\Delta_{pred}$ isn't change so much even with relatively large $\\Delta_{pred}$. It easy to explain cause in this case loss roughly speaking equals $\\ln \\frac{\\Delta_{pred}}{\\Delta_{true}}$ so division and logarithm using decrease a loss anough.","7d1eeb36":"In terms of dependences:","e892321e":"Check an additional property:","09cba2ad":"Where $G$ is a *geometric mean*.

We have to return regression prediction and it's confidence simultaniosly, but usually we're asked to return either class prediction with probability or only regression one. This notebook presents a method for solving this task with Splitted Loss: task will be splitted into two part and for each part particular loss will be presentd with high correlation with target Laplace Loss. Mathematical proof for Splitted Loss will be given with corresponding implementations and pictures for some cases.
