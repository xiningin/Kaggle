Based on the histograms above, \n- Do malignant tumors have higher or lower values for `'Area (mean)'` (relative to benign tumors), on average?\n- Which tumor type seems to have a larger range of potential values?","7128a7e3":"In this exercise, you will use your new knowledge to propose a solution to a real-world scenario.  To succeed, you will need to import data into Python, answer questions using the data, and generate **histograms** and **density plots** to understand patterns in the data.\n\n## Scenario\n\nYou'll work with a real-world dataset containing information collected from microscopic images of breast cancer tumors, similar to the image below.\n\n![ex4_cancer_image](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/qUESsJe.png)\n\nEach tumor has been labeled as either [**benign**](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Benign_tumor) (_noncancerous_) or **malignant** (_cancerous_).\n\nTo learn more about how this kind of data is used to create intelligent algorithms to classify tumors in medical settings, **watch the short video [at this link](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9Mz84cwVmS0)**!","dcc0c83a":"#### Part B\n\nA hospital has recently started using an algorithm that can diagnose tumors with high accuracy.
