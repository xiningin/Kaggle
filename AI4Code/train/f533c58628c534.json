It is achieved by constantly and repeatedly analysing the processes, corrections and transactions of the employer by the bot. The bot thus gains the knowledge to process the incoming data and think and perform the suitable action, getting smarter and more accurate over time. It automatically extracts the data needed for decision making and continuously learns from employer\u2019s feedback.
