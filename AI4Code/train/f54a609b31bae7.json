Since, the competition uses mean ROC-AUC as the evaluation metric, we will be using the same in the notebook.","c241fabb":"## 0. Introduction\nIn earlier notebook(https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/anirbansen3027\/jtcc-word2vec) we used Gensim for getting pretrained Word2Vec models\/embedding vectors for the words used in the sentences, mapped them against the output variables \"toxic\",\"severe_toxic\",\"obscene\",\"threat\",\"insult\",\"identity_hate\" and used Multi Output Logistic Regression Classifier wrapper from sklearn to create Logistic Regression models for all the 6 output variables.\n\nIn this one, we will be using fastText library for both generating embeddings for the sentences as well as text classification. Infact, it gives us an option of doing both in one go. The intuition part is going to be shorter than other methods as the documentation\/ readings on the fastText are limited.\n\n**What is fastText?**\n\nIn 2016, Facebook AI Research (FAIR) is open-sourced fastText, a library designed to help build scalable solutions for text representation and classification. fastText take the idea of word embeddings in Word2Vec a step ahead and learns representations\nfor character n-grams, and to represent words as the sum of the n-gram vectors. Taking the word \"where\" and n = 3 as an example, it will be represented by the character n-grams: <wh, whe, her, ere, re>. Apart from txet representations in form of sub-word embeddings, it also provides an off-the-shelf classfication model which is optimized to work with these embedding and give fast results.\n\n**Why is fastText required?**\n\nfastText has 2 benifits over regular word2vec embeddings:\n\n*1. fastText helps in dealing with Out of Vocabulary(OOV) problem:*\n\nWord2Vec faces the problem of Out of vocabulary. Lets say we are training a Word2Vec model from scratch, we setup a vocabulary which contains of all the words in the training data. Now if we have a new word in the test data for which we might be needing embedding, the new missing word will be OOV. In word2vec we completely ignored such words. By using sub-word embeddings in fastText, we try to get an embedding for a word which is OOV as well\n\n*2. By using a distinct vector representation for each word, the Word2Vec model ignores the internal structure of words:*\n\nIn word2vec each word is learned uniquely based on the context it appears in. For example  boxer and boxing are used in different contexts and there is no way we can capture the underlying similarity. Breaking it down to character n-gram helps\n\n**What are additional benifits of fastText?**\n\nAlthough fastText goes beyond word level to character-ngram level, It is extremely fast (and hence the name).Experiments show that fastText is often on par with deeplearning classifiers in terms of accuracy, and many orders of magnitude faster for training and evaluation. We can train fastText on more than one billion words in less than ten minutes using a standard multicore CPU, and classify half a million sentences among 312K classes in less than a minute.\n\nAdditionally, fastText provides word vectors for 157 languages trained on Wikipedia and Crawl (which is amazing).\n\n**How does fastText work?**\n\n*1. Creation of word embeddings*\n\nThe subword model is based on the skipgram model from Word2Vec and instead of using the vector representations of words, an average of the vector representations of the character n-grams are used. Eveything else is quite similar to the skipgram model. \n\n*2. Text Classification*\n<img src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Gl1PiFO.png\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" width = 300\/> \nAbove image is taken from the actual paper \"Bag of Tricks for Efficient Text Classification\" where fastText for classification was introduced. fastText uses a shallow neural network similar to Word2Vec networks. We use the softmax function f to compute the probability distribution over the predefined classes.\n\nInfact, it uses something called Hierarchical softmax based on the Huffman coding tree (the most common word\/alphabet is given the smallest code in short). So, in Hierarchical softmax probability of a node is always lower than the one of its parent. This helps both when we have a large number of classes and at testing time where we are searching for the most likely class. \n<img src=\"https:\/\/media.geeksforgeeks.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/20200921040227\/treec.png\" width = 300\/> \nFor example, if Travel, Food and Indian Cuisines are 3 classes, and if Travel has a higher probability, we dont even need to calculate the probability for Food and Indian Cuisines. This saves reduces the complexity.\n\nAdditionally it also uses word n-grams as additional features other than the embeddings to capture some partial information about the local word order which is otherwise very computationally expensive to cature in normal BagOfWords.\n\nLet's dive into the code then \n\n### Table of Contents:\n\n[1.

We did some unicode normalization it order to handle some unicode issues that might arise\n\n4. This one being the most important, converting the binary labels for all output variables from 0 and 1 to \\__clas__0 and \\__class__1 as the fastText classifier needs it that way. We only need to do this for the training_data as the classifier will not look at the real labels of the validation data or the test data\n\n5.
