It is a supervised machine learning algorithm. The algorithm can be used to solve both classification and regression problem statements. The number of nearest neighbours to a new unknown variable that has to be predicted or classified is denoted by the symbol 'K'.\n\n#### What is KNN algorithm example?\n>In supervised learning, you train your data on a labelled set of data and ask it to predict the label for an unlabeled point. For example, __a tumour prediction model__ is trained on many clinical test results which are classified either positive or negative.","8759ee37":"__Note:__ in this notebook i used elbow method to find best k.
