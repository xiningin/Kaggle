As Wikipedia says, this problem ask for: \"Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city and returns to the origin city?\" \n\nIt is a NP-complete problem so it doesn't exist a suitable method that will be solve this easily. Unlike other problem, for example, solving linear equations where we have a formula for returning the solution, here there is'nt anything like that. This is where arises the heuristics or metaheuristics: algorithm of search algorithms, genetic algorithms, etc. Most of these algorithms do not return the optimal solution but a one good solution. \n\nIn a first approach, we would think about force brute. The character of this problem could suggest us to explore all the possible paths and keep the shortest one. This is unfeasible because of the computational cost $\\mathcal{O}(n!)$, e.g. if we would have $n = 1000$ cities we will have to analyze about $\\mathcal{O}(10^{2568})$ paths. So we will have to discard this approach and find more selective search algorithms.\n\nThis **Kaggle challenge** suggests a variant of the TSP because we will have a constraint: \"every 10th step is 10% more lengthy unless coming from a prime CityId\". The reasonable try to solve this challenge is to apply heuristics that have been successfully applied to the TSP but keeping in mind the prime constraint.\n\n**In this kernel**, I will introduce this challenge showing how to load the data and some visualizations.","e40a011e":"### Distance function","b5e430fd":"**New column:** We will create a column in the dataset indicating whether each city is prime or not.","090c16b3":"How much prime cities are?

We would look that the prime cities are distributed along the map so in each $10$th city will would be possible to pass through a prime city. So we expect that this constraint can be decisive for good solutions and we will not have to ignore it."}}
