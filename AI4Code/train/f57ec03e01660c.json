Since it is faster than GridSearchCV, it can explore the hyperparameter space more in the same amount of time, or give us a fast approximation. The results for the best hyperparameters are listed above.","877d5d35":"# Dataset\n\nLet's import the dataset","aa19a786":"# Tuning Hyperparameters\n\nFor hyperparameter tuning, I decided to move away from GridSearchCV and use RandomizedSearchCV, which randomly samples from different distributions that are supplied to each hyperparameter (if a list is used, elements from it are sampled uniformly). Only geometric and uniform distributions are used.\n\nThe thought process behind using a geometric distribution for the number of estimators was that we want to smoothly make the usage of more and more estimators less likely. The geometric distribution also makes it so that we pay \"more attention\" to lower numbers (since it might make a difference to pick 100 or 125 estimators) than higher numbers (since it might not make much difference if we pick 500 or 525 estimators).","319345bc":"### SVR as Base Estimator\n\nSupport Vector Machines can be used for regression (usually called \"Support Vector Regression\" in this context). The approach is similar to regular SVMs, except this time the error is calculated as the absolute difference between the real output and predicted output, and constraints involve making these differences smaller than some small error value (though slack variables are added to allow for some misclassification, similar to \"soft margins\" in regular SVMs).","a4672fe3":"### Gradient Boosting\n\nGradient Boosting is based on the idea that Boosting can be viewed as an optimization algorithm, with each iteration following the negative gradient with respect to the outputs of the model of some differentiable loss function. Although *(I believe)* like Bagging, different base estimators can be used in theory, in sklearn only Decision Trees are implemented (like in AdaBoost, the default parameters make it so that the trees can't become too complex). ","2bc5d77b":"### Extremely Randomized Trees\n\nExtremely Random Trees takes the idea of Random Forests even further by introducing more randomness in an effort to reduce variance. Instead of choosing the most optimal thresholds for splits, random thresholds for each feature currently being considered are calculated and the best of the most discrimanative amongst these is chosen.","95db85fa":"Get our raw training samples","d5608c05":"### AdaBoost w\/ Decision Stumps\n\nAdaBoost is a very popular Boosting algorithm, and was the first practical and useful Boosting algorithm to be developed. Boosting in itself is the idea of combining various weak learners (models that do better than chance) to create a powerful ensemble model. AdaBoost does that by iteratively training models while prioritizing samples that were misclassified in previous iterations. In the context of regression, \"misclassification\" becomes how far away a prediction was from the true output value. The final estimator is a weighted sum of the weak learners, weighted by how well each performs.\n\nLike in Bagging, Decision Trees are a common choice for the underlying base estimators. However, Bagging performs best with fully developed and complex models, while Boosting prefers simple models (i.e. weak learners). Thus, short Decision Trees are used, also referred to as \"Decision Stumps\". This is the default option in sklearn (thus no estimator is specified here either).","ade35190":"### Random Forests\n\n*Note: sklearn's documentation seems to indicate that the below is the case, but feedback would be appreciated as the wording is not 100% clear.*\n\nRandom Forests build on the idea of Bagging and take it a step further by slightly changing how the trees are built (note that with regular Bagging, no modifications are made to how the underlying model works which is why any model can be used). Instead of using a subset of features for each individual model, subsets are obtained when splitting a node. Just like before, using all samples and all features would be redundant, so this is not considered.","597283b7":"And transform some of the categorical features into one-hot encoding","69205a0f":"### Bagging w\/ Decision Trees\n\nBagging is a technique that builds an ensemble of models with the main goal of reducing overfitting (variance) of said model without having to change its underlying algorithm. Each model is built by using random samples of the dataset drawn with replacement, and sometimes also a random subset of features (when that is the case, the method is technically known as Random Patches as opposed to Bagging). Both are explored here through the parameters provided to GridSearchCV. Note that using all samples and all features would be redundant as we would simply be building many identical models and averaging those (obtaining the same result as one individual model).\n\nDecision trees are a very common option for the underlying model, and are in fact the default parameter in sklearn (thus no estimator is specified in the code below).
