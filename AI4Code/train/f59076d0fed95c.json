The questionnaire listed below is the reference I used to create this notebook. I have answered all these questions through the notebook and at the end have also provided a brief cheat sheet for YouTubers with the guidelines on how to get a video trending.\n\nAll the visualizations have been done through plotly as they are interactive, beautiful and awesome. I also did it as it's a great way to explore the plotly syntax.\n\nHope you enjoy reading this notebook and I would love your feedback or questions in the comment section."}}
