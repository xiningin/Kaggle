Perhaps signal coming from experiment itself wasn't audible - for instance, it was infrasound. Either way, one approach was to just treat the data as a digital audio signal at 44100 Hz frequency. 44100 was chosen because it's most common audio resolution (a bit like 720p for video).","cea5b93a":"## De-noising the signal\nThe signal seemed to be full of noise, so one thing to try was to try to remove that noise by using 'sox' tool, which is conveniently provided by Kaggle image. The sound became more \"audible\", though it was still hard to make sense of what's happening!\n","e5d24bd2":"## Hear it coming?\nWhen looking at the data in this form it looks suspiciously like sound waves. So my initial guess was to listen to it - to \"audiolise\" it, just like we're visualising graphical data. It was unknown if the earthquake can be predicted: \"by ear\". Just like in a dubstep song - the listener can hear the build-up before the \"drop\", so, perhaps, an earthquake can be felt in a similar fashion.","a25b3f80":"*Thank you for your attention - I know that this Notebook is a bit of a disorganised dump of ideas, but I really just wanted to put something out already!

The used sample is under 15 seconds, so I hope \"fair use\" applies!","f4ef27b2":"## Data Provided\nTraining data-set for this competition consists of a long time-series of measurements from some sort of an earthquake simulation in a laboratory. As a \"test\" dataset we are given bits of similar time-series, and the question we have to answer is \"when\". When the next earthquake (in a lab) is going to happen. The idea is that by analysing those time-series measurements and having some examples of when those lab earthquakes were registered in the past, we can make predictions about the future.","dc27454d":"## Predicting Earthquakes?\nPredicting earthquakes has long been thought to be near-impossible. But same has been said about many other things, I still remember how 15 years ago my IT teacher in high school was saying that speech recognition can never be done reliably by a computer, and today it's more reliable than a human. So who knows, maybe this competition will be a major step in solving another \"impossible\" problem. Importance of predicting earthquakes is hard to underestimate - selected years of our century claimed hundreds of thousands of causalities. Being able to predict earthquakes could allow us to better protect human life and property.","dbb4f9d0":"## Putting two together\nNow all that's left is to combine sound with video. This is not a particularly fast or easy process in a Kaggle notebook; be sure you are ready to wait if you want to re-run it. Also, some libraries are missing from Kaggle image - so the next cell does a little \"fix\".","dd59eceb":"## Animating the wave\nWhat's lacking in the previous sample, is the ability to know when the earthquake was registered. In order to have that - we need to have some visualisation."}}
