It is the second phase of a larger process of product translation and cultural adaptation (for specific countries, regions, cultures or groups) to account for differences in distinct markets, a process known as internationalisation and localisation. [More](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Language_localisation)\n\n## What is use of localization ?\n\nAssume you are writer for a movie, you have created a script in Hindi language. Considering that the script is in Hindi it will have character's name, product name, localtion based in India. Now, this movie was a blockbuster in India and producers from different parts of world want to re-create this movie in their country, they will require the scripts which will be in Hindi, a writer from Germany won't understand it. Firstly this script has to be translated into German language which can easily done nowadays by using google translate but the character's name, product name, locations will be still of India. This is where localization comes in play, we can use this technique to convert these named entities of Inida to Germany. Example capital of India i.e., **Delhi** can be converted to **Bonn** which is the capital of Germany.\n\n## Problem statement\n\nGiven data we will try to acheive localization on it. Below are the steps which is involved,\n\n* Accept the data(**pdf\/document\/txt or raw**) from user.\n* Use [SpAcy](https:\/\/spacy.io\/usage\/linguistic-features#named-entities) to extract named entites(location, name of people's, organization names etc).\n* Pass these named entites to [word2vec](https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/introduction-to-word-embedding-and-word2vec-652d0c2060fa) and find localized words of these entities according to whichever country we require.\n* Replace the localised word with the original one in the data accepted from user .\n\nIn this notebook i have showed above steps by using [streamlit](https:\/\/www.streamlit.io\/) which allows us to create a user friendly front end.\n\n","b6b39c87":"![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n\n\nAbove is what the pdf contains i.e, only 2 sentence.","9d3de7e7":"After installing, import the required libraries.","25a75209":"7.
