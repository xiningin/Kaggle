You will start to explore most often a new domain with a never seen before dataset. Over the coming few week we will not only learn a lot about proteins, but also learn new AI techniques. In the best case, we might actually improve upon existing algorithms. How nice would that be? ;)\n\nIn this notebook we explore the dataset to get a better understanding of the domain and how to handle the data. Machine learning models will we build in a seperate notebook, once we feel confortable with the data.\n\n\n## File descriptions\nA full description of the files can be read here https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/human-protein-atlas-image-classification\/data. The dataset consist of the following files:\n\n- *train.csv* - filenames and labels for the training set.\n- *sample_submission.csv* - filenames for the test set, and a guide to constructing a working submission.\n- *train.zip* - All images for the training set.\n- *test.zip* - All images for the test set.\n\nLet's first start with exploring the train.csv file.","8e53514c":"## Statistics\n\nIt is important to know how many samples there are per target. Sometimes a dataset is 'imbalanced', e.g. there are many more samples of target A than target B. This could impact the performance of the model and requires special training preparation.","ad0c8edd":"Finally, let's print several nice plots of the proteins.","a57f27bc":"From the full description we learn that the labels are protein organelle localization labels for each sample, defined by\n\n0.

Sometimes, you should spent some time on making a 'nice' representation of your data. It's not only fun to do, but representing data in different formats might emphasize different aspects of data. In this case, we could try to merge all four images ('channels') into a RGB images (3 channels). For this we define a 4x3 transformation matrix that turns 4 channels into 3 rgb channels.","5d2060f9":"# Data Exploration\nDutch AI team\n\n## Version\n\n25\/10\/18\nSetting up notebook and team.
