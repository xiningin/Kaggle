Here the matrix U denotes the document-topic matrix while (V) is the topic-term matrix.**\n\n**Each row of the matrix U(document-term matrix) is the vector representation of the corresponding document. The length of these vectors is the number of desired topics. Vector representation for the terms in our data can be found in the matrix V (term-topic matrix).**\n\nSo, SVD gives us vectors for every document and term in our data. The length of each vector would be k. **We can then use these vectors to find similar words and similar documents using the cosine similarity method.**\n\nWe can use the truncatedSVD function to implement LSA. The n_components parameter is the number of topics we wish to extract.\nThe model is then fit and transformed on the result given by vectorizer. \n\n**Lastly note that LSA and LSI (I for indexing) are the same and the later is just sometimes used in information retrieval contexts.**","ce91bed4":"## [Please star\/upvote in case u like it. ]","395f805b":"#### DATA CLEANING & PRE-PROCESSING","3236e062":"#### As we can see Topic 7 & 8 are dominantly present in document 0.\n\n ","126b0ff8":"#### To better visualize words in a topic we can see the word cloud.
