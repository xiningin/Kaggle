We are learning about linear regression and our professor gave us a practice question just to get us familiar with basic problems. But I decided that I would write the code for linear regession, finally stepping out of my tutorial hell. I was jumping with joy when I saw the intercept and the coeffecient of regression turned out to be what I calculated by hand. As the title says, it ain't much but it's honest work.\n\nAlso I still just save version all the time I want to save but now I finally understand how this works!"}}
