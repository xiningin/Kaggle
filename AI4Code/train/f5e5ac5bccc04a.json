The datapoints outside of the min\/ max are called outliers. It is important to look for them, since these values are especially small or high. They could be faulty values. \n\nOutliers affect:\n* dataset distributions and patterns\n* Metrics e.g. mean and standard deviation\n* Performance of machine learning models\n\nCommon reasons for outliers:\n* Data entry errors\n* Measurement errors\n* Data manipulation and preprocessing errors\n* Just plain novelty values (not errors)\n\nIf outliers are errors, these entries should be dropped from the dataset. If not they could store valueable information for the machine learning model.\nFor now I am not going to delete any rows of the dataset, because I cannot be sure some of the extreme values are erroneously.
