spectrum of the Data first, so we loaded a fraction of 50000 samples from their files, downsampled them with a highpass filter at 20Hz and now we're going to perform a fourier transformation of all signals. Because Fourier Analysis has problems with the shap edges of a signal we are going to apply a tukey filter, which is going to let the signals to a cosine decay at the ends. Then the ends are padded with zeros and the FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) is applied.  \nWe will get the weighing factors for certain frequencies in the sample and average over all the samples to get the power spectrum.","67e2c1d9":"Once again, I'm really not sure, if everything went well.

The point of this notebook is to get the signal preprocessing out of the way and arrive at a usable big array containing all the preprocessed signals in this Competition. Since I\u00b4m not so experienced, please let me know about possible improvements and errors, which need to be fixed.  \n\nSo: What are we going to do? Basically, we\u00b4re trying to remove the brunt of noise and downsample the 70gb of data to make all of the information usable.  \nIn Terms of preprocessing we\u00b4re trying to follow this publication about signal preprocessing at the LIGO and VIRGO observatories: https:\/\/iopscience.iop.org\/article\/10.1088\/1361-6382\/ab685e (Chapter 3 & 4).  \nIn Short, they downsample their data (with a high pass filter at 20Hz), then whiten their Signal and bandpass filter to get most stuff away except for the relevant irregularities between 35 and 350 Hz.  \nHuge Shoutout to https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/allunia for her work.","5c22f6dc":"### Results\nThe red crosses are the different values for the frequencies while red line is just a simple moving average of them","4aa8708e":"### Whitening of the Signal\nThe Preprocessing that we are going to do is fairly simple: Resample the signal down, apply a tukey filter, decompose the signal using a fft, downweigh the common frequencies according to the spectrum and reconstruct the timeseries using an inverse Fourier transform. Then, apply a bandpass filter so we are just going to keep frequencies between 35 and 350 Hz (which, apparently are the only relevant signals).","212eb612":"# Signal Whitening\n## Intro\nObviously, their Detector mostly measures Noise from all sorts of sources. Who knows. However, we are not intrested in all the noise that's constantly going through the detector, we are intrested in very special events that happen rarely. A good way to downweigh the Noise is through a spectral analysis. Basically, we are going to perform a Fourier Transformation\/Analysis to record the frequency of occurence of signals with different frequencies.  Then, we are going to downway the more common frequencies by 'making them more silent' and make all the frequencies equally likely to occur (ie Gaussian with mean = 0 and std=1). This way, if something relevant happens, we can easily see an irregular spike in the different frequencies and make signals much more easy to detect.\nImagine a Picture taken through a red window. Obviously, the picture is going to contain to much red and if we are looking for the stuff behind the window, we are going to downway the red pixels and make them less bright to be able to see more detail in the 'signal' behind the widow."}}
