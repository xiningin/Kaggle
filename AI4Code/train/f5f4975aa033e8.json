that analyze data used for classification and regression analysis. Given a set of training samples, each marked as belonging to one or the other of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns new test samples to one category or the other, making it a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier. Reference [Wikipedia](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Support_vector_machine).","1284d47f":"Thus, the best models are MLPRegressor, SGDRegressor and Linear Regression.","cd825129":"The core principle of **AdaBoost** is to fit a sequence of weak learners (i.e., models that are only slightly better than random guessing, such as small decision trees) on repeatedly modified versions of the data. The predictions from all of them are then combined through a weighted majority vote (or sum) to produce the final prediction. The data modifications at each so-called boosting iteration consist of applying N weights to each of the training samples. Initially, those weights are all set to 1\/N, so that the first step simply trains a weak learner on the original data. For each successive iteration, the sample weights are individually modified and the learning algorithm is reapplied to the reweighted data. At a given step, those training examples that were incorrectly predicted by the boosted model induced at the previous step have their weights increased, whereas the weights are decreased for those that were predicted correctly. As iterations proceed, examples that are difficult to predict receive ever-increasing influence. Each subsequent weak learner is thereby forced to concentrate on the examples that are missed by the previous ones in the sequence.

The default values for the parameters controlling the size of the trees (e.g. max_depth, min_samples_leaf, etc.) lead to fully grown and unpruned trees which can potentially be very large on some data sets. To reduce memory consumption, the complexity and size of the trees should be controlled by setting those parameter values. Reference [sklearn documentation](https:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/generated\/sklearn.ensemble.ExtraTreesClassifier.html). \n\nIn extremely randomized trees, randomness goes one step further in the way splits are computed. As in random forests, a random subset of candidate features is used, but instead of looking for the most discriminative thresholds, thresholds are drawn at random for each candidate feature and the best of these randomly-generated thresholds is picked as the splitting rule. This usually allows to reduce the variance of the model a bit more, at the expense of a slightly greater increase in bias.

It also reduces variance and helps to avoid overfitting. Although it is usually applied to decision tree methods, it can be used with any type of method. Bagging is a special case of the model averaging approach. Bagging leads to \"improvements for unstable procedures\", which include, for example, artificial neural networks, classification and regression trees, and subset selection in linear regression. On the other hand, it can mildly degrade the performance of stable methods such as K-nearest neighbors.

It splits the tree leaf wise with the best fit whereas other boosting algorithms split the tree depth wise or level wise rather than leaf-wise.

Also, it is surprisingly very fast, hence the word \u2018Light\u2019.

In each stage n_classes_ regression trees are fit on the negative gradient of the binomial or multinomial deviance loss function. Binary classification is a special case where only a single regression tree is induced. The features are always randomly permuted at each split. Therefore, the best found split may vary, even with the same training data and max_features=n_features, if the improvement of the criterion is identical for several splits enumerated during the search of the best split. To obtain a deterministic behaviour during fitting, random_state has to be fixed.
