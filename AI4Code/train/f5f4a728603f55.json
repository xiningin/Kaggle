Logistic Regression is a linear classification model that learn the probability of a sample belonging to a class and tries to find the optimal decision boundary that separates the classes.\nThe main difference between the two is that Naive Bayes is a Generative Model and Logistic Regression is a Discriminative Model. A Generative Model is one that tries to recreate the model that generated the data by estimating the assumptions and distributions of the model. It then uses this to predict the unseen data. For example Naive Bayes models the joint probability of feature X and feature Y and tries to predict the posterior probability based off that model. A Discriminative model is built based only on the observed data and includes less assumptions on the distribution of the data. However, it is very reliant on the quality of the data. For example Logistic Regression directly models posterior probability by learning the input to output mapping by minimizing error.","f3f7479c":"# PERFORM DATA CLEANING - REMOVE STOPWORDS","f869f73f":"# EXPLORE DATASET","ac8fd1f4":"# IMPORT LIBRARIES AND DATASETS","7cbe6a83":"## Things to Remember\n* Easy to understand and fast to implement\n* Need less training data than logistic regression\n* Performs well for categorical input values\n* \u201cZero Frequency\u201d or if a categorical variable has a category in the test set that is not present in the training set, the model will assign a 0% probability to this category making it unable to make a prediction. This can be fixed by using a smoothing method such as Laplace estimation. Laplace estimation assigns a small non-zero probability to data not in the train set. This is extremely relevant for text classification. For example if one word does not appear in the train set you do not want the classifier to lower the probability of the entire document to 0.\n* Assumption of independent predictors","c71bc7c3":"#  UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND BUSINESS CASE\n\nTwitter is one of the platforms widely used by people to express their opinions and showcase sentiments on various occasions.

Naive Bayes is a classification algorithm used for binary or multi-class classification. The classification is carried out by calculating the posterior probabilities and finding the hypothesis with the highest probability using MAP. Basically, it is finding the probability of given feature being associated with a label and assigning the label with the highest probability. It is referred to as naive because it assumes all features are independent, which is rarely the case in real life.","118f7588":"Here I don't find any null values ","427cefc8":"# UNDERSTAND THE THEORY AND INTUITION BEHIND NAIVE BAYES"}}
