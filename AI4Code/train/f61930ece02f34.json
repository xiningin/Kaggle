When you see that, think *zero*.\n\nSplit points for categorical dtypes depends on the `max_cat_to_onehot` which I have set to 128 - so categoricals in this data set are treated with a one-vs-all split. This means `feature==value` in the node split test, instead of the usual `feature<=value`. `max_cat_to_onehot` is by default set to 4, meaning categories with more values than this use splits based on target statistics, and the resulting split points have values like `1||3||5||7||8||9` which indicate which category codes go down the *left* branch. (But this is hard to show in bar charts... hence I used *one-vs-all splits*.)\n\n**Note**: in this adversarial version, *id* columns are included. Two (`DeviceInfo` and `id_30`) have more than 128 values, so their bar charts have these obscure very long axis labels :)\n\nLightGBM keeps a separate bin for NaN values and at all node tests, records whether that bin goes left\/right separately - this is not shown here.\n\n## What to Look For\n\nWith adversarial validation, one of the the aims is to detect differences in the train\/test set features, and possibly alter the representations to make test look more like train, with the hope that this results in better model accuracy.\n\nIn some ways what we **don't** see is more interesting than what we **do**. As with normal feature importances: if we see a feature is not used at all it is clearly not useful in detecting train\/test difference, so is probably a safe feature to predict isFraud.\n\nIf there is **one prominent peak** it means the train or test sets have values on one side of the split that are not present in the other set. It may make sense to cap the values in both sets.\n\n## Notes\n\nHere are some quick observations:\n\n - <a href=\"#plot_ProductCD\">ProductCD<\/a> differs most in the H, R and S values, as also seen in the [heatmap plots notebook][4].\n\n - <a href=\"#plot_id_30\">id_30<\/a> has very clear peaks at `iOS 11.4.1` and the later values of `Mac OS X 10_13_4` onwards, which are obviously time-related, software versions released in the test set era.\n\n - <a href=\"#plot_Cents\">Cents<\/a> has an interesting spike at about 0.989 - which might be tied in to [Chris Deotte's discussion post here][8].\n\n\nA further useful extension would be to look at how the leaf node values vary underneath each split in the left\/right branches, similarly to [SHAP plots][9]...\n\n\n [1]: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Double-precision_floating-point_format\n [2]: https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/porto-seguro-safe-driver-prediction\/discussion\/43886\n [3]: https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/tilii7\n [4]: https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/jtrotman\/ieee-fraud-time-series-heatmaps\n [5]: https:\/\/en.cppreference.com\/w\/cpp\/numeric\/math\/nextafter\n [6]: https:\/\/github.com\/microsoft\/LightGBM\/blob\/master\/src\/io\/bin.cpp\n [7]: https:\/\/github.com\/microsoft\/LightGBM\/blob\/master\/include\/LightGBM\/meta.h \n [8]: https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/ieee-fraud-detection\/discussion\/108467#624331\n [9]: https:\/\/github.com\/slundberg\/shap","e276d26b":"And the predictions are generally lower for the training set (first half) and higher for the test set (2nd half).","104eab26":"# *FAST* Cross Validation with *Cached OOF*\n\nLet's use (nearly) all input columns as features, and run a KFold CV.
