because their total number of parameters is not fixed and will grow with the volume of data used for the training. Parametrics models (ex: logistic regression) offers a contrario a first level of interpretation by the way of their coefficients (but in fact even this is not completely trivial). In that case, regularization techniques like L1-regularization\/LASSO can be usefull to reduce the feature space and improving the interpretability of the model. For non-parametric models, fortunately, many of them like XGBoost give an access to interpretation methods like feature importance for helping us to understand the inner evaluation of the model for making his predictions.","cac28339":"SHAP values can explain the output of any machine learning model but for complex ensemble models it can be slow. SHAP has c++ implementations supporting  *XGBoost*, *LightGBM*, *CatBoost*, and *scikit-learn* tree models.\n\nSHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Its novel components include: the identification of a new class of additive feature importance measures, and theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties. Typically, SHAP values try to explain the output of a model (function) as a sum of the effects of each feature being introduced into a conditional expectation. Importantly, for non-linear functions the order in which features are introduced matters. The SHAP values result from averaging over all possible orderings. Proofs from game theory show this is the only possible consistent approach. \n\nAn intuitive way to understand the Shapley value is the following: The feature values enter a room in random order. All feature values in the room participate in the game (= contribute to the prediction). The Shapley value __$\u03d5_{ij}$__ is the average marginal contribution of feature value __$x_{ij}$__ by joining whatever features already entered the room before, i.e.\n\n$$\\phi_{ij}=\\sum_{\\text{All.orderings}}val(\\{\\text{features.before.j}\\}\\cup{}x_{ij})-val(\\{\\text{features.before.j}\\})$$\n\nThe following figure from the KDD 18 paper, [_Consistent Individualized Feature Attribution for Tree Ensembles_](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/pdf\/1802.03888.pdf) summarizes this in a nice way!\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/6Rc1dsa.png)","ff5fd8a5":"***","55b7529c":"To make random forest predictions more interpretable, every prediction of the model can be presented as a sum of feature contributions (plus the bias), showing how the features lead to a particular prediction.

For categorical features, it perturbs by sampling according to the training distribution, and making a binary feature that is 1 when the value is the same as the instance being explained. The `explain_instance()` function generates explanations for a prediction. First, we generate neighborhood data by randomly perturbing features from the instance.

But can we build an approximation or a surrogate model which is more interpretable from a really complex black box model like our XGBoost model having hundreds of decision trees?\n\nHere in, we introduce the idea of using __`TreeSurrogates`__ as means for explaining a model's learned decision policies (for inductive learning tasks), which is inspired by the work of Mark W. Craven described as the TREPAN algorithm. \n\nWe recommend checking out the following excellent papers on the TREPAN algorithm to build surrogate trees.\n - [_Mark W. Craven(1996) EXTRACTING COMPREHENSIBLE MODELS FROM TRAINED NEURAL NETWORKS_](http:\/\/ftp.cs.wisc.edu\/machine-learning\/shavlik-group\/craven.thesis.pdf)\n - [_Mark W. Craven and Jude W. Shavlik(NIPS, 96). Extracting Thee-Structured Representations of Thained Networks_](https:\/\/papers.nips.cc\/paper\/1152-extracting-tree-structured-representations-of-trained-networks.pdf)\n\nBriefly, Trepan constructs a decision tree in a best-first manner. It maintains a queue of leaves which are expanded into subtrees as they are removed from the queue. With each node in the queue, Trepan stores,\n\n - a subset of the training examples, \n - another set of instances (query instances),\n - a set of constraints. \n\nThe stored subset of training examples consists simply of those examples that reach the node. The query instances are used, along with the training examples, to select the splitting test if the node is an internal node or to determine the class\nlabel if it is a leaf. The constraint set describes the conditions that instances must satisfy in order to reach the node; this information is used when drawing a set of query instances for a newly created node. The process of expanding a node in Trepan is much like it is in conventional decision tree algorithms: a splitting test is selected for the node, and a child is created for each outcome of the test. Each child is either made a leaf of the tree or put into the queue for future expansion.\n\n\nFor Skater's implementation, for building explainable surrogate models, the base estimator (\"Oracle\") could be any form of a supervised learning predictive model - our black box model. The explanations are approximated using Decision Trees (both for Classification\/Regression) by learning decision boundaries similar to that learned by the Oracle (predictions from the base model are used for learning the Decision Tree representation). The implementation also generates a fidelity score to quantify tree based surrogate model\u2019s approximation to the Oracle. Ideally, the score should be 0 for truthful explanation both globally and locally.

They have already, and will have in the future, more and more impact on our society and our everyday's life. As (future) Data Scientist \/ Machine Learning Engineers, even if we clearly don't need interpretability all the time, I think we have a social and professional ethical duty trying to design models as **fair, accountable and transparent** as possible. Meaning : unbiasedness\/non-discriminative, giving reliable results and being able to be queried to validate predictive decisions.The recent European GDRP (General Data Protection Regulation) resolution testifies to a citizen \"right to explanation\" of algorithmic decisions that \"significantly\" affect any individual. Further more, interpreting our machine learning processes could give us valuable insights for :\n\n- debugging\n- informing feature engineering\n- model comparisons\n- driving future data collection\n- informing human decision-making\n- and generally for better communication and trust building.\n\nThe intend of this tutorial is twofold :\n- to give a basic introduction to the subject, looking at different strategies for tackling the potential \"black-box\" problem in a **model-agnostic** fashion. \n- to have a practical grasp on some of the main frameworks actually available for machine learning interpretability like __ELI5, LIME, SKATER, or SHAP__ (and also PDPbox and FairML). \n\nAfter loading and providing a [description of the data](#descrip_data), a [quick EDA](#eda), and [training\/evaluating our model](#model), we will be exploring more in depth differents interpretation techniques like : \n\n1.

Typically, an `Interpretation` consumes a dataset, and optionally some metadata like feature names and row ids. Internally, the `Interpretation` will generate a `DataManager` to handle data requests and sampling.\n\n- Local Models: to create a skater model based on a local function or method, pass in the predict function to an `InMemoryModel`. A user can optionally pass data samples to the examples keyword argument. This is only used to infer output types and formats. Out of the box, skater allows models return numpy arrays and pandas dataframes.\n\n- Operationalized Model: If your model is accessible through an API, use a `DeployedModel`, which wraps the requests library. `DeployedModels` require two functions, an input formatter and an output formatter, which speak to the requests library for posting and parsing. The input formatter takes a pandas DataFrame or a numpy ndarray, and returns an object (such as a dict) that can be converted to JSON to be posted. The output formatter takes a requests.response as an input and returns a numpy ndarray or pandas DataFrame.","eb35bd88":"<a name=\"shap\"><\/a>\n# Model Interpretation with SHAP","632c6f49":"### Features distributions","eebdf6af":"# Building Train and Test Datasets\n\nNow for sake of simplicity let's transform our target data to a binary classification problem ('Low' vs 'Hight' quality wine) and build our train and test datasets on a classical 70\/30 ratio.","0069643c":"> Again, you can play also with 'total sulfur dioxide' and 'sulphates' for exemple","d4d9cce2":"<a name=\"model\"><\/a>\n# Training our classification model","f262401a":"<a name=\"eda\"><\/a>\n# Quick EDA and Visualization","229ea05d":"__[FairML](https:\/\/github.com\/adebayoj\/fairml)__ is a new Python library that audits black-box predictive models. The basic idea behind FairML (and many other attempts to audit or interpret model behavior) is to measure a model\u2019s dependence on its inputs by changing them. If a small change to an input feature dramatically changes the output, the model is sensitive to the feature.\n\nBut what if the input attributes are correlated?\n\nThe trick used here to counter this multicollinearity is **orthogonal projection**. FairML orthogonally projects the input to measure the dependence of the predictive model on each attribute. Orthogonal projection of vectors is important because it allows us to completely remove the linear dependence between attributes. If two vectors are orthogonal to one another, then no linear transformation of one vector can produce the other. This intuition underlies the feature dependence measure.\n\nOne advantage of FairML is that it can audit any classifier or regressor. FairML only requires that it has a `predict function`.\n\nSee [FairML: Auditing Black-Box Predictive Models](https:\/\/blog.fastforwardlabs.com\/2017\/03\/09\/fairml-auditing-black-box-predictive-models.html) by the author for an exemple of use-case.","e889f424":"> The above visualization can be interacted with in multiple ways.
