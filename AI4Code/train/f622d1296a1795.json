I expect this to increase\/adjust in future uplodas of the dataset.\n<br>We can also see a rise in symptoms without a rise in positive results, from the probable case status (bottom graph). To me, this indicates people becoming more cautious of getting covid during winter months when symptoms can overlap with the common cold or flu.","eb1c2fdb":"From the distribution we can see that women are more likely to be lab-confirmed than men, but there are more women going to get tested than men.","4ce661aa":"# Columns Explaination\nInformation from [here](https:\/\/data.cdc.gov\/Case-Surveillance\/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data\/vbim-akqf).\n* cdc_report_dt - Date received by Centre for Disease Control (CDC)\n* pos_spec_dt - Date of first positive specimen collection\n* onset_dt - Date of symptoms onset (only if symptomatic)\n* current_status - Lab confirmed, or Probable Case\n* sex - Sex of patient\n* age_group - Age of patient, binned on 10 year periods\n* Race and ethnicity - **Interesting one. **\n* hosp_yn - Hospitalised?\n* icu_yn  - ICU Admitted\n* death_yn - Died?\n* medcond_yn - Underlying disease?\n\n## Let's do some Data Cleansing\nSince we do not have unique patient identifiers it would not be wise to remove \"duplicates\".\nInstead lets look at unique values and column types","6bae16b2":"#### Unknown vs. Missing\nFrom a downloadable word doc ([here](https:\/\/wwwn.cdc.gov\/nndss\/document\/Methods_for_Conveying_Unknown_Values_in_Case_Notification_Messages_20161108.docx), downloads), Missing states a data entry was not provided while Unknown means it is applicable but no value can be given. In this context, it could be a case of backlog reports, or \"missing\" but the field is required.\n#### Dates\nI've left the dates out of this search, but they range from 14 Jan 2020 to 10 Nov 2020. Earliest symptoms were the 14th January, earliest positive test was 21st January, and earliest reported case to CDC was 28th January.\n#### Sex\nI would be interested in seeing what could render sex be missing or unknown.\n#### Age\nBinned data on 10 year periods, fairly good split of data\n#### Race & Ethnicity\nInterestingly, they have combined this data but are not distinguishing between white\/non-hispanic, and white\/hispanic. Looking at a CDC report on this ([here](https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/phin\/resources\/vocabulary\/documents\/cdc-race--ethnicity-background-and-purpose.pdf)) explains that a user can select a race (6 options), and an ethnicity( 2 options; hispanic\/latino OR not hispanic\/latino). Yet in this dataset they have combined them with only hispanic\/latino or combinations of races and not hispanic. Leaving out the possiblity of races with hispanic ethnicity. They do have a link to federal standards of classifying race and ethnicity, but it is a [broken link](http:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/omb\/fedreg\/ombdir15.html) to the White House website. Thanks Trump. The reason hispanic is not in combination with a race is because the CDC defines this as:\n<br>Hispanic or Latino \u2013 A person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race.
