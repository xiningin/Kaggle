However, I've seen little to no image processing background tutorials. What an image actually is? What is equalization? What are filters and how do we use them? \n\nThis series of tutorials is meant as a foundation for further readings in Computer Vision. Throughout it we'll make use of the popular OpenCV library.\n\n\n# Tutorial Index\n___\n- [What is an image?](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/hrmello\/intro-to-image-processing-what-is-an-image\/)\n- [Colorspaces](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/hrmello\/intro-to-image-processing-colorspaces)\n- [Image Enhancement Part 1](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/hrmello\/intro-to-image-processing-image-enhancement-pt-1)\n\n# Introduction\n___\n\n\nFirst let's talk about what images are. At their core, images are nothing but numbers, each one representing the intensity of a given color or other numeric value -- depending on the colorspace you are in. I'll talk more about it in the next tutorial. \n\n## Gray images\n\nIn the image below, we see several pixels in grayscale. \n![Image](http:\/\/www.whydomath.org\/node\/wavlets\/images\/imagebasicslowerleft.gif) \n\nThis is how the image looks like for our computers. Just a bunch of numbers representing the intensity of the gray color in each pixel:\n![Pixels](https:\/\/i.ibb.co\/Hp7t80B\/Screenshot-from-2019-04-25-22-00-06.png)\n\nThe intensities vary from 0 to 255 -- so there are 256 possible values for each pixel to take.\n\n## Colored images\nColored images are similar, except they are represented by three of those pixel intensity matrices, called channels. When an image is in RGB color system, each of those matrices represent the intensities of Red, Green and Blue colors respectively, as can be seen on the image below.\n\n![rgb_matrix](https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/profile\/Jane_Courtney2\/publication\/267210444\/figure\/fig6\/AS:295732335661069@1447519491773\/A-three-dimensional-RGB-matrix-Each-layer-of-the-matrix-is-a-two-dimensional-matrix.png)\n\nHere, too, the intensities can vary from 0 to 255 in each channel, giving us the overwhelming number of 256x256x256 = 16777216 different colors each pixel can be.\n\nNow that we are familiar with the very basics from images, let's see this with actual code. \n\n"}}
