If we need sensical stem word, then there's a process called `Lemmatization` which takes care of dictionary words, but it is slower compared to `Stemming`_","09c3ae6c":"### Stemming\n\n_It is the process of reducing infected words to their word stem. This is required to reduce complexity while processing different words._\n\nConsider an example: \"This is a sentence from a collection of sentences.\". Here `sentence` and `sentences` are word of same stem but in different form. In our textual processing, most of the times, we just need to work with the stem word and not different forms of same stem. Therefore, using Stemming process, we can bring `sentence` and `sentences` to stem word i.e. `sentence`.\n\nFor Stemming, `nltk` provides different Stemmers, but we're going to use `SnowballStemmer`.\n\n","cf73262f":"It seems that we have 10 missing summaries in IMDb plot column.\n\nTo resolve this, we could create a new column called \"Plot\" and append \"Wiki_Plot\" with \"Imdb_Plot\"","389426d3":"`stopwords` are those words in a given text which do not contribute considerably towards the meaning of the sentence and are generally grammatical filler words. For example, in the sentence _'Dorothy Gale lives with her dog Toto on the farm of her Aunt Em and Uncle Henry'_, we could drop the words 'her' and 'the', and still have a similar overall meaning to the sentence. Thus, 'her' and 'the' are stopwords and can be conveniently dropped from the sentence. On setting the stopwords to 'english', we direct the vectorizer to drop all stopwords from a pre-defined list of English language stopwords present in the nltk module.\n\n`ngram_range` defines the length of the ngrams to be formed while vectorizing the text.","fe7b127b":"## Basic data exploration","c0b2b711":"### Tokenization\n\n_Tokenization is the process by which we break down articles into individual sentences or words, as per the requirement. It is required to enable machines to understand context between 2 articles, if they are similar or far apart._\nFor example, consider a sentence \"This is a sentence\", if we try to match this whole sentence in the document, we might not find any matching sentence, but if we break the sentence into words and try find match again with words, it might match using different words in the document.","1caabee1":"As we can observe from above example, that we have words with punctuations or even numbers which doesn't make sense in our current analysis of similarity, we can filter these words using Regular expressions.","ff9e0cd7":"## Use NLP techniques to convert \"plot\" into numerical vectors","e0609ad6":"We can visualize the similar items in the form of `dendrogram`. Dendrograms help visualize the results of hierarchical clustering, which is an alternative to k-means clustering. Two pairs of movies at the same level of hierarchical clustering are expected to have similar strength of similarity between the corresponding pairs of movies.","f489a36a":"### Convert tokens into numerical vectors\n\nTo apply any Machine Learning algorithm, we are required to convert text tokens into numerical vectors. We're going to use `TfIdfVectorizer` i.e. `Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency Vectorizer`.

","71d9102c":"Now, as we have converted our text (plot summaries) into numerical vectors, we can apply Clustering algorithm to cluster similar items together. \n\n`Clustering` is the method of grouping together a number of items such that they exhibit similar properties. According to the measure of similarity desired, a given sample of items can have one or more clusters.\n\nWe're going to use `KMeans` clustering. `KMeans` is the algorithm in which the given sample is divided into `K` clusters where each cluster is denoted by the mean of all the items lying in that cluster."}}
