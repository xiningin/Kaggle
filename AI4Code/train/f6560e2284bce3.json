We've built out the structure and the backwards pass. You'll implement the forward pass through the network. You'll also set the hyperparameters: the learning rate, the number of hidden units, and the number of training passes.\n\nThe network has two layers, a hidden layer and an output layer. The hidden layer will use the sigmoid function for activations. The output layer has only one node and is used for the regression, the output of the node is the same as the input of the node. That is, the activation function is $f(x)=x$. A function that takes the input signal and generates an output signal, but takes into account the threshold, is called an activation function. We work through each layer of our network calculating the outputs for each neuron. All of the outputs from one layer become inputs to the neurons on the next layer. This process is called forward propagation.\n\nWe use the weights to propagate signals forward from the input to the output layers in a neural network. We use the weights to also propagate error backwards from the output back into the network to update our weights.

Essentially, backpropagation is an algorithm used to calculate derivatives quickly.\nArtificial neural networks use backpropagation as a learning algorithm to compute a gradient descent with respect to weights. Desired outputs are compared to achieved system outputs, and then the systems are tuned by adjusting connection weights to narrow the difference between the two as much as possible.
