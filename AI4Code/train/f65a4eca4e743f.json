You just got some contract work with an Ecommerce company based in New York City that sells clothing online but they also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers come in to the store, have sessions\/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want.\n\nThe company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website. They've hired you on contract to help them figure it out! Let's get started!\n\nJust follow the steps below to analyze the customer data (it's fake, don't worry I didn't give you real credit card numbers or emails).","8515f223":"## Residuals\n\nYou should have gotten a very good model with a good fit. Let's quickly explore the residuals to make sure everything was okay with our data. \n\n**Plot a histogram of the residuals and make sure it looks normally distributed. Use either seaborn distplot, or just plt.hist().**","7e9b5f29":"** Train\/fit lm on the training data.**","3830c3c4":"## Conclusion\nWe still want to figure out the answer to the original question, do we focus our efforst on mobile app or website development? Or maybe that doesn't even really matter, and Membership Time is what is really important.  Let's see if we can interpret the coefficients at all to get an idea.\n\n** Recreate the dataframe below. **","55022e82":"## Training and Testing Data\n\nNow that we've explored the data a bit, let's go ahead and split the data into training and testing sets.\n** Set a variable X equal to the numerical features of the customers and a variable y equal to the \"Yearly Amount Spent\" column. **","5e17a298":"** Create a scatterplot of the real test values versus the predicted values. **","55c1ac2c":"** How can you interpret these coefficients? **","0aaca3e4":"**Create a linear model plot (using seaborn's lmplot) of  Yearly Amount Spent vs. Length of Membership. **","f7e70190":"## Imports\n** Import pandas, numpy, matplotlib,and seaborn.
