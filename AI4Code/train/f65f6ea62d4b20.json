scores for `math_score`, `reading_score` and `writing_score` is 100, both genders inclusive.\n- Overall, female students performed better than male students in `reading_score` and `writing_score` with `math_score` being the exception where male students performed better than female students.\n- Outliers for female students below the minimum for `math_score`, `reading_score` and `writing_score` were more compared to male students.","6dbc425a":"## Univariate Exploration\n\nI will start by looking at the distribution of all the scores.","fbde6bb5":"## Bivariate Exploration\n\nTo start off with, I want to look at the pairwise correlations present between numeric features in the data.","6a8e1331":"### What is the structure of your dataset?\n\n- There are 1,000 diamonds in the dataset with 10 features (`gender`, `ethnicity`, `parental_level_of_education`, `lunch`, `test_preparation_course`, `math_score`, `reading_score`, `writing_score`, `percentage` & `grade`). \n\n- Most variables are qualitative in nature, but the variables `math_score`, `reading_score`, `writing_score`, `percentage` are quantitavive in nature.\n\n- Variable `grade` is an ordered factor variable with the following levels:\n\n(best) \u2014\u2014> (worst) <br>\ngrade: S, A, B, C, D, E, F\n\n### What is\/are the main feature(s) of interest in your dataset?\n\nI'm most interested in figuring out what features are best for predicting the scores of the students in the dataset.\n\n### What features in the dataset do you think will help support your investigation into your feature(s) of interest?\n\nI think features such as `test_preparation_course` will have quite an impact on students score & grade. I will also be comparing score values with grade using the `gender` variable for more info.","70c633ab":"### Discuss the distribution(s) of your variable(s) of interest. Were there any unusual points? Did you need to perform any transformations?\n\nThe score variables were mostly distributed normal with only some outliers which caused the plot to be very slightly left-skewed. No transformations as such was required.\n\n### Of the features you investigated, were there any unusual distributions? Did you perform any operations on the data to tidy, adjust, or change the form of the data? If so, why did you do this?\n\nAs said earlier, there were some outliers for the score variables. These outliers were not removed in order to account them bivariate exploration. Secondly the ratio for male and female gender were found to be almost 1:1 with only sigltly more number of females. This was not accounted for any data cleaning as the difference is not drastic.","7cee4eab":"Grading criteria:\n\n- 100-91 - S\n- 90-81 - A \n- 80-71 - B \n- 70-61 - C \n- 60-51 - D \n- 50-41 - E \n- Less than or equal to 40 - F","74d3db3b":"- The result is intriguing as it conveys that only around 1\/3rd of students have completed the test preparation course.","680a0a41":"- Students with parents who have completed master's degree scored the best.\n- Stuents with parents who have only completed high school had a comparitively low performance in terms of percentage.","bb59ce0c":"### Talk about some of the relationships you observed in this part of the investigation. How did the feature(s) of interest vary with other features in the dataset?\n\n- All the scores were centainly highly corelated with a linear relationship. And so was percentage with all the score variables. - No transformations were required to prove this.\n- Female students performed well compared to male students, but interestingly outliers were more for female students in the lowest grade than compared to the male students.\n- As expected, students who completed the test preparation course, had high percentages as compared to the students who didn't complete the test preparation course.\n\n### Did you observe any interesting relationships between the other features (not the main feature(s) of interest)?\n\n- There was an interesting relationship found between `parental_level_of_education` and `percentage` feature, but this will not be carried forward in the next section as the difference is not much.","f60fa991":"- As it can be seen, students who completed the `test_preparation_course` scored high percentage.\n- Female students did well in both the categories of `test_prepar\u0325ation_course`.","80889f2d":"# Student Performance Dataset Exploration\n## by Nishant Jha\n\n## Preliminary Wrangling\n\nThis document explores a dataset containing certain scores and attributes for 1000 students.","3b5fbaab":"### Talk about some of the relationships you observed in this part of the investigation.
