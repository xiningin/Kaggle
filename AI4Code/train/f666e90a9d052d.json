Many may feel guilt that they cannot be there to help with schoolwork or frustration that they can\u2019t navigate the technology their children are required to use. \"\n\n\"Educators can increase opportunities for family engagement by being flexible. Providing students with menus of activities that they can pick from will help them to be more independent. And many caregivers prefer having a week\u2019s worth of activities up front so that they can plan around their work schedules\"\n\n\"Instead of expecting caregivers to become teachers, educators can complement family engagement by partnering with caregivers to address children\u2019s social and emotional needs. For families, educators can be the person who checks in on their child. Teachers can be there to talk to their child about all that is going on when they are busy trying to make ends meet. Teachers can be an advocate for their child when there is a need. \"\n\n\"It\u2019s OK to put the worksheets down. It\u2019s OK to spend time checking on your students.

RACHAEL MAHMOOD - APRIL 27, 2020\n\n\"Taking time to check assumptions about family engagement can make a huge difference in the lives of your students and their caregivers.\"\n\n\"Research confirms that family involvement positively impacts students\u2019 academic experiences. And in this moment of crisis, especially, engaging our students means engaging their families: Including caretakers is one way to support our students from a distance.\"\n\n\"More often, however, the examples caregivers used to describe their engagement did not align with what educators frequently identify as family involvement. Parents and guardians described teaching cultural lessons and supporting social emotional learning, for example. They engaged with their children\u2019s schooling by relocating to change school districts and navigating social services to ensure their children\u2019s needs were met.\"\n\n\"When designing engaging lessons, even the most well-intentioned teachers can make incorrect assumptions about family involvement. Not all caregivers are home with their children during this distance learning time. Many students are home alone, are being cared for by older children or are taking care of younger children. Caregivers who are at home may be adjusting to working remotely. Only a small percentage of students have a caregiver free of other responsibilities who can dedicate time to guiding them through their learning packets or navigating websites.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/www.learningforjustice.org\/magazine\/rethinking-family-engagement-during-school-closures","212c00d0":"\"The plot above is made of all the dots in the train data.
