This might affect some outcomes in our future explorations so we should always keep this in our minds.","7ac49c97":"**Let us look at what states have the most weightage in the dataset**","117972f7":" <h1>  <center> Indian Cuisine EDA <\/center> <\/h1> \n\n<center><img src='https:\/\/curlytales.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/Ardor-1.jpg'\/><\/center>\n\n\n>Image Courtsey: [Curly Tales](https:\/\/curlytales.com\/united-india-thali-ardor-2-1-delhi\/)\n\n<p style='font-size:16px'>Indian cuisine is known worldwide for its wide variety of dishes. This variety is a direct result of the diversity in soil, climate, culture, ethnic groups, and occupations. In this notebook, we will look at a small subset of Indian cuisine and explore it to find any interesting observations.<\/p>\n\nDataset by: [Neha Prabhavalkar](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/nehaprabhavalkar)\n","a997ac86":"We can see that Punjab is the only contributer to the starters category. Morever, Gujarat is the leader of snacks whereas West Bengal is the leader of desserts.","1c8743dd":"Let us look at other columns now.","4d4e3793":"Hooray! we are done with the data cleaning processes. Let us now start with the data exploration!","893fb9cd":"Now that we've looked into the course category based on states, **let's also look at it from a regional perspective.**","f9df4f44":"Similary, let us plot the **cooking time of veg and non-veg dishes**.","ee30861d":"Looks pretty good! Although it seems like the dessert ingredients are dominating the word cloud. So just for the sake of it, **let's look at the ingredient word cloud without the desserts.**","2e72f8b6":"Surprising to nobody, spicy food seems to be leading in both categories.","14808f7c":"There is one column of the dataset we have completely avoided until now, which is the ingredients column. So now, **let's explore that through word clouds!**","b4d745fd":"Assam seems to be a clear winner here, followed by West Bengal. It is also worth noting that Tripura and Assam both are in the top 5 list, both of which belong to the North-East part of India. Maybe if we look at the **vegetarian and non-vegetarian comparison from a regional point of view**, we will get another perspective of this comparison.","4883072e":"**Let us do the same exploration on regions rather than states.**","7c35d92c":"Now, let us look at the **preperation time of veg and non-veg dishes**.","0014e503":"We can observe that west as a whole is the leader of both snacks and desserts. Moreoever, north is the only source of starters in the dataset (that too, solely due to Punjab as we have already seen).","6a68bedf":"prep_time and cook_time also has some values set to -1. This data can also be filled in with some research. However, let us leave that as is for now.","25a3baae":"There are some states and regions which have missing values. Now, it is possible to look up every single dish on a search engine and try to find out its origin, but that seems to be tedious work and even then the result might end up being highly controversial! Instead, let's mark all the states as 'Unknown' to have a seperate category of dishes whose state of origin is not known.","5a0ae3f6":"## Thank you!\n\nThis was my first EDA notebook that I ever worked on. Criticism and feedback are welcome :)"}}
