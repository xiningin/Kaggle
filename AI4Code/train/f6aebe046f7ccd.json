Hope you will like it.\n\n#### Overview\nCoronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.\n\nMost people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.\n\nThe COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so it\u2019s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).\n\n![](https:\/\/encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com\/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcQpFWqi1APbGE6wMcbczBG3IfduP0ex5QTMcA&usqp=CAU)","36563db1":"#### Hover this map and enjoy","60969fc5":"### Plot of top 15 countries with most no. of cases","a43bdd26":"### Plot of top 15 countries with highest death rate per 100 cases","890dd075":"### Plot of top 15 countries with highest % increase of cases in a week","dad59c2f":"#### Let's check whether there is any null values in the data or not"}}
