These would be the perfect type of user that the kaggle team should make an effort to encourage using kaggle kernels!","6fffe2a9":"# Hosted Notebooks and IDEs\nAs we've already seen, jupyter notebooks are quite popular in the kaggle community. But what about jupyter-like hosted notebooks?  We could make the argument that these are IDEs aswell. Lets look at the popularity of hosted notebooks from the kaggle survey.\n- Over 30% of respondents have no experience with hosted notebooks\n- Not suprisingly Kaggle Kernels are the most popular for kaggle respondents with roughtly 25% of respondents saying they've used them. What may be more suprising is how close the next two popular hosted notebooks are. JupyterHub\/binder being used by 20% and Google Colab by 14.8%.\n- After that it's a steep dropoff to the next types of hosted kernels.","1bb6d10b":"# The country you reside and your IDE\n(Results shown are % of respondents who use the IDE within the county)\n\nSome really interesting insights can be drawn from looking at IDE use by country.

This is only to keep the visualizations easy to read and gain insights.\n\nSome insights that stand out are:\n- China and Russia have less love for RStudio compared to other countries. They also appear to be heavier PyCharm users.\n- Jupyter is not as popular in China as in other countries, with only 46% of chinese respondents saying they use Jupyer. China also has more than average MATLAB users.\n- Visual Studio Code is popular in Brazil with 30% of brazilians saying they've used it.\n- Spyder apears to have a slightly stronger following in India than in other countries.","c3fea518":"# Freeform Responses\nThe survey question we are exploring provided a list of options for respondents to select from.

Specifically, we looked at the types of development environments (or IDES) that Kagglers have said they've used over the past 5 years. We found some interesting relationships between the software and tools that kagglers use and how it relates to their job title, salary, and country of origin. We not only looked at what IDEs were popular, but how respondents overlapped in their use of different IDEs. By looking into the freeform responses, we've identified some popular IDEs that the kaggle team might want to include in next year's survey.\n\nFinally, we used unsupervised machine learning techniques to cluster the kaggle respondents into four distinct groups. These groups were each unique, but the cluster that consisted of respondents who had not used Jupyter\/IPython stood out in their responses to the other survey questions as being the least like the other groups. The \"Ani-Jupyter\" group tends to be more diverse in their use of programming languages, less likely to consider themselves a Data Scientist, and they spend less time in data projects exploring for model insights.  This is not to say that the anti-Jupyter group does not want to learn new things.  Suprisingly, 23.6% of them say they \"have never used machine learning methods **but plan to**\".\n\nThe anti-Jupyter (or non-jupyter) are an important part of the kaggle community. Whether they are experienced software developers who aren't interested in using jupyter - or if they are new to programming and data science- they are part of the community that Kaggle should focus on reaching. Kaggle Kernels are a great resource and remove many of the barriers that some of the community may have with installing Jupyter on their local computers. Hopefully, more of them will join the community, become involved in using Kaggle kernels, and help us grow and become more diverse.\n\nThanks for reading!","ba41c6ee":"# Correlations between IDEs and Salary\n\nIt's always fun to plot the data by salary.   Of course, we shoud be weary of drawing any causal conclusions from this analysis. Correlation does note equal causation! Don't change the IDE you use thinking it will make you more money.\n\n*Note: I ignored NA values and those that answered \"I do not wish to disclose my approximate yearly compensation\" to the salary question. This may bias our results and should be considered.\n\nSome takeaways:\n- Each IDE appears to have it's own unique trend when looking at popularity vs. income which I find unexpected and interesting.\n- RStudio use appears to have a somewhat normal distribution around the mid-salary range.\n- PyCharm and VSCode appear to be fairly flat, with little changes in popularity around income.\n- Notepad++ starts to trend downward as salary goes above \\$100k. VIM trends upwards.","cc5ea6aa":"### 1. Anti-Jupyters are more diverse in their use of programming languages\nWhile Python is the clear favorite amonst all kagglers, and R is a close second. We find the the non-jupyter cluster has consistantly more percentage of their group that chooses other programming languages as their language of choice. It stands out that those that don't use jupyter may fall into these two categories:\n- Stictly R Users: who prefer to use RStudio and rather not deal with jupyter's R integration.\n- Database engineers: Who code much in raw SQL\n- Software Developers: who code in languages like C++, C# and Javascript\n- Excel users who code in VBA\n- Specialized programmers who prefer non-open source langagues like SAS and STATA","9ea2b44d":"Next we will use the KMeans clustering algorithm to divide the kaggle survey respondents into four groups based solely on their IDE use.

As the author of the attached article states \"For choosing an appropriate value for K, just run the experiment using different values of K and see which ones generate good results. \" That is exactly what we've done.

We compare the IDE use of different job types below. This chart allows us to see what percentage of professional groups use each IDE. \n\nSome interesting insights we can see are:\n1. Jupyter\/IPython is popular for pretty much every job title. This is obviously biased because the respondents also use kaggle! Surveying non-kaggler \n2. Statisticians use Jupyter the least (51.9%). Is this because they also tend to be R users (74.68% use RStudio)?\n3. DBA\/Database Engineers and Software Engineer are heavy Notepad++ users, but I find it personally suprising that Data Journalists and Developer Advocates also use this IDE.  What drives this similarity among disparate occupations?\n4. Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code are popular amonst Developer Advocates and Software Engineers\n5. Matlab looks to be quite popular within academia. Students, Research Assistants, Research Scientists, and Principal Investigators stand out as Matlab users.","fdc6fff1":"# Students Love Jupyter!\n\nNearly half of the Kaggle survey respondents answered that they were \"students\". Since jupyter has a large use within academia and teching, it's interesting to see how the venn diagram differs between students and non-student respondents. While Jupyter is still very popular amonst both groups, the overlap between jupyter and the next top two popular IDEs (RStudio and Notepad++) varies much less for students. For non-students there are some exclusive users of other development environments like RStudio and Notepad++, but also every student that uses these IDEs  has also had some interaction with Jupyter.","5667e207":"# IDE Use By Age\nWe can also take a look at how age and IDE use relate.

Those that use Jupyter are much more likely to consider themselves \"Data Scientists\"\nWhile around 55% of respondents who use jupyter consider themselves a data scientist.

This is consistent with the fact that many students use Matlab. \n- PyCharm and Sublime Text catch up to Notepad++ in popularity in the higher salary range (\\$100k+). Could this be because this is the salary range of a serious python developer?\n- We can see the proportinal relationship between Jupyter and unix based text editors varies in salary range. We see a Jupyter to Vim ratio of almost `4:1` in the \\$0-\\$10k salary, but that drops down to a `2:1` ratio in the \\$150-\\$200k range.

Generally what IDEs do respondents say they've used? Is there a specific type of IDE that is more or less common among respondents? Are there IDEs that are commonly used together? How does this compare to other tech communities like Stack Overflow?\n2. Are there other respondent details that correlate with the IDE they use?

You can see that there are more exclusive Notepad++ users than PyCharm and Sublime Text, but the areas where they overlap are strikingly similar. The 1556 people in the center are possibly just people who enjoy trying out new software.  The question that is being asked states `[which IDE] have you used at work or school in the last 5 years?` This could mean that respondents aren't necessarily stating which IDE they like the most, just the ones they've used.\n\n\\* *It's important to note (as pointed out by @sciplic in the comments) Notepad++ is a Windows only text editor.
