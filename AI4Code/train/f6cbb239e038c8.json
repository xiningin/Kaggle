It does this by transforming the data into fewer dimensions, which act as summaries of features. High-dimensional data are very common in biology and arise when multiple features, such as expression of many genes, are measured for each sample. This type of data presents several challenges that PCA mitigates: computational expense and an increased error rate due to multiple test correction when testing each feature for association with an outcome. PCA is an unsupervised learning method and is similar to clustering1\u2014it finds patterns without reference to prior knowledge about whether the samples come from different treatment groups or have phenotypic differences.\n","6cb95717":"# Scaling the Data","dcfb3cfd":"# Import Dataset","33cbd668":"# Dataset Description\n\n#### Context\nThis dataset comes from a proof-of-concept study published in 1999 by Golub et al. It showed how new cases of cancer could be classified by gene expression monitoring (via DNA microarray) and thereby provided a general approach for identifying new cancer classes and assigning tumors to known classes. These data were used to classify patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).\n\n#### Content\nGolub et al \"Molecular Classification of Cancer: Class Discovery and Class\nPrediction by Gene Expression Monitoring\"\n\nThere are two datasets containing the initial (training, 38 samples) and independent (test, 34 samples) datasets used in the paper. These datasets contain measurements corresponding to ALL and AML samples from Bone Marrow and Peripheral Blood. Intensity values have been re-scaled such that overall intensities for each chip are equivalent.","00b944e4":"# Calculating the Explained Variance by the Component","dc2ebf00":"# Model Implementation","653ff89a":"# Import Libraries","3f52b17a":"# Data Preparing","f4f1090c":"# How to Choose n-components?"}}
