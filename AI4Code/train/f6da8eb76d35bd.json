Then, we build a predictive model with those features that have a larger influence on the player salary.\n\nSince for each player we have a wide range of statistics at our disposal, we are going to consider for this analysis only some relevant ones, to avoid multicollinearity in our predictors. Thus, we will take into account the minutes per game (MPG), the points per game (POINTS) and the offensive\/defensive real plus-minus values (ORPM and DRPM). Furthermore, we are also analyzing other sort of features such as the player position and some social indicators (Twitter and Wikipedia).\n\nLet's go for it!","537e1964":"**Conclusion** There is an interesting tendency to pay somewhat larger salaries to those players that contribute to the team offensively, rather than defensive players.

After analyzing the rest of the features, we would be able to determine how big is this influence in comparison to other predictors.","acaf8a09":"Let's remove from our dataframe most of the features related to player statistics and let's keep the rest of them. To be fair, we are removing from further analysis some really promising features, like the games played (GP) among others. However, we have observed this variable to be highly correlated with the MPG abd besides, we prefer to have a small amount of predictors to keep the model tractable and the notebook relatively short.\n\nThen, we are going to plot the pairwise relationships for the variables in the dataset, to see how our predictors are related with each other and with the independent variable. In this figure, we separate the players per position as is the only categorical variable that we have in the selected dataset.","663181d1":"### Using a second order linear model <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"10_1_second_order\"><\/a>\n\nFinally, we study the performance of a second order linear model only to observe how the predictions will improve for the train set, but they degrade considerably when using the same model to infer salaries on the test set.","65f1a2a8":"## How is social impact related with the salary? Twitter <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"7_twitter\"><\/a>\n\nAs we see in the plot below, the data has very obvious outliers when it comes to twitter interaction. For this reason, it is very unlikely that a linear model is able to capture the relationship between this and the salary of the player. To explore to what extent the salary can be predicted by the twitter interactions, we build a second order polynomial regression model. ","f7c0c36e":"**Conclusion:** It looks that we have clearly one of the most important indicators so far. We observe that (as expected) the points per game is one key factor to determine the salary of a player. Both, the R2 and the RMSE indicate that it is more strongly related with the salary than the minutes per game. Let's continue analyzing the rest of the variables.","b0500339":"**Conclusion:** Somehow surprisingly, age is not a key factor to explain the salary. The reason may be the way the salary range is designed in the NBA, where the salaries of the players tend to draw a curve, where the best contracts are signed during the middle period of their career. In this case, it could have made sense to use a second order polynomial model to explain the salary based on the age.","21f9d812":"**Conclusion:** Althout our model still shows significant bias, it performs much better than any of the features considered independently. In fact, our best predictor so far (POINTS per game) only achieved a R2=0.41 and RMSE=5.31, on the train set. Which is significantly worse than the resulting metrics for this model on the test set. Additionally, the model behaves relatively well for unseen data. Still, there is a lot of room for improvement as, on average, **we are off by more than 4.5M per player**, which is an very important amount of money.\n\nFinally, we are going to examine the regression coefficients as an indicator for the importance of each variable on our model. However, this is only an indicator as we cannot compare these coefficients direclty, since the scale varies largely between the different predictors in our model. In other words, the units in which we measure the twitter interactons have nothing to do with the points per game, which makes it impossible to compare them directly.","4e7e792d":"### Same statistical test applied to defensive RPM per position <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"6_1_defensive_rpm\"><\/a>\n\nThe previous test did not yield any significant result. However, to prove the validity of the previous statistical test, we are going to perform the same analysis but in this case with the DRPM as the dependent variable.","aca875e2":"### Offense <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"5_2_offense\"><\/a>","3c7b72d6":"Still, we would be interested in running all possible statistical tests between all five groups. For this, we employ MultiComparison with [Tukey post-hoc test](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tukey%27s_range_test) to spot the individual differences between groups.","b03f0cff":"## Predicting the salary for our favourite player\n\nLet's twist the initial problem and give our model another purpose. What if we were not in the role of the general manager of the franchise but the player instead, who wants to sign a juicy contract. In this case, we are going to use our model to predict the salary we should be earning and use it to negotiate with the franchise."}}
