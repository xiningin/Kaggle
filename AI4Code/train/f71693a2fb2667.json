It helps us develop code quickly and focus on the main objective of a program. However, we can override this behavior through declaring our own function. Examples will show later in this tutorial. Following is the list of some famous packages\n\n1. Math\n2. Numpy\n3. Pandas\n4. Matplotlib\n\nfollowing is the command to import theses packages in the program\n\n***import [package name] as [identifier]***\n\nNow its code time.    \n\n","fa171e65":"So far we have seen the basic building blocks of Python. However, in order to build a professional software, we need to modularize our code in an efficient way. So, when the number of lines cross thousands or millions, it would still be easy for us to maint it. Like every language, Python also provides functionality to build classes,packages and functions etc. In upcoming sections,we shall discuss it further with example. ","c5360dd9":"Instead of adding theroy, i shall try to explain each concepts through examples. So lets start with data types. Following are the data types available in python and i have also added an example for each data type","ff0f6dd8":"**Loops**\n\nSometime, we need to repeat a single statement multiple times. To address it, every language provide loops which iterate statements unless the counter reach the upper limits or condition become false. In python, we normally use two loop statements.\n\n1. For Loop\n2. While Loop\n\nBoth loops server the purpose, the usage depends upon individual's preference. However, we shall discuss both in details.","ab3070e1":"**Challenge**\n\nCan you write a code to find whether a string contains numeric valueor not.\n\nI shall provide the solutions at the end of the kernel.\n","1192ceef":"In above example, we have written a programe which will calculate the power of any number and as you can see instead of running on a counter, it is running based on the condition. The while loop will terminate, once the condition returns false. The formula to calculate the power is very simple.\n\npower 2 of a number = number * number\npower 3 of a number = number * number * number\n\nIn the above logic, we have assigned the number to our result without any condition and they iterate the loop till the power is greater than one and each time we are multiplying the result variable with the number. ","e2ab2dff":"**Important Points about If Statment**\n\n1. == has been used for equality operation\n2. we may have many elif based on the complexity of problem. However, we do have only one else and it will be the last part of if statment\n3. Unlike C\/C++, Python uses identation for block statements. We need to be careful, when use nested if into our codes. Because, it will waste time\/energy, if the indentation is not correct.","e602094c":"The above function will recieve a parameter and execute the loop from 0 till the value of parameter. The advantage of writing a function is reuse functionality instead of duplicating the code. For example, in the above case, we are calling function instead of writing loop two times. Next, we shall define the function to calculate factorial of a given number","5cd61ede":"Let me start this journey with learning python programming langugae. I would say,  it is one of the easist language for programming as compare to C\/C++ and Java and you will find out the reasons later in this kernal.","a86ec8f4":"I shall discuss the above data types, once we use them in the code.  ","14bdfc63":"Multiple Skillsets are required to attain experties in Data science and machine learning and I do appreciate the tirless efforts of experts and masters on kaggle who are helping data science and machine learning communities through valuable kernals and knowledge articles. \n\nHowever, I do believe to divide the training material into segments and teach learners and beginers one segment at a time. So they can acquire the expertise in a systematic way. By saying it, I am starting a series of Kaggle kernels for beginers and learners to start their journey of data science and machine learning from noice to professional level. ","15fcba5c":"The formula to calculate factorial is very simple. You need to multiple a number from itself till one. For example, factorial of  5 = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 =120. You can run the for loop in the given solution and figure out how it is calculating the factorial of number. \n\n**Small Challenge:**\nYou can try to re-write the solution using while loop","6e5b676f":"**Topic Coverd in the Series**\n\nFollowing is the list of segments, I would cover in this series. \n\n    1.

It will list down all available function and then you can use help([function name ]) for further help.","95494720":"Again, try to execute the above code on a paper and understand, how it is identifying a string value is palindrome or not. The most important point for learning is translating technical problem into small segments and then solve one at the time. For example, in the above example, i don't think of comparing string to its reverse. Instead, i put focus to identify the lenght of the string and then put a while loop to read the character in reverser order which starts from the end of a string and reach to the starting index of it, \n\nImport Note:\nPython string\/Array index starts from O and goes upto lenghth-1. \n\nOnce, i identify the way to find the reverse, i store it in another variable for comparison and when the loop finishes its execution, the comparison of both values are providing the solution. ","8d7bfa06":"Its time to add condition into our codes. In Python we use **If else** statement to apply conditions. Lets look at the following example.  "}}
