Based on the graphs below, it seems that the model is overfitting the training data. This can be seen by the model preforming significantly worse on \"unseen\" validation samples. To improve this model in the future we can use things such as Dropout and other methods that help with over fitting. The links below helped with plotting and calling the accuracy and loss of the model.\n\nhttps:\/\/machinelearningmastery.com\/display-deep-learning-model-training-history-in-keras\/\n\nhttps:\/\/keras.io\/callbacks\/"}}
