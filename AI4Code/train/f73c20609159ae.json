Final considerations","e2407b55":"The plot above shows the annual electricity consumption the 10 largest municipalities from 2009 to 2018. We see that Rotterdam is experiencing a decrease in the annual consumption since 2012, while cities such as Utrecht, Nijmegen, Breda, Tilburg and Groningen do not seem to change significantly. On the other hand, the data for Eindhoven shows a huge increase in the annual consumption from 2016 to 2018. Almere seems to follow the same trend as Rotterdam, descreasing the consumption little by little each year, and Amsterdam has a descrease in 2015 but it goes back to an almost constant line.\n\nTo understand better some of this behavior we may also look at other features in the dataset. For example, was there an increase of connections in Eindhoven that led to this change from 2016 to 2018? And for the cities that experienced a reduction in the annual consumption, does it related to the use of renewable resources? For this second question we can check the percentage of the net consumption of electricity. If lower, this indicates that more energy returned to the grid. ","c6f622c3":"Although an overall behavior suggests that the annual consumption of electricity increases as we increase the number of connections, we cannot make any strong statement, since we only have 10 data points and in the period 2012-2015 the increasing trend is broken. There should be other variables that are affecting this growth. \n","87668fd6":"In the plots above we split the data for the largest municipalities into two categories: the counts of percentage that is either **100%** or below (i.e. **Not 100%**). In this manner, we can investigate if there a trend towards lowering the delivery of energy, meaning that more people are using renewable energies like solar panels.\n\nHere, we decide to use a boxplot, which measures the spread of the data, to compare the electricity delivery percentage distribution along the years. The first plot shows that from 2009 to 2018, there has been a significant decrease of the maximum value (also identifying some outliers, i.e. the individual diamonds records). The mean of the distribution has moved towards left, indicating that the distribution has changed its shape from right to left skewed. In 2018, 75% of the data falls below the median of 2009.

We observe that for all net managers there has been an increase of the mean percentage of consume during low tarif hours.

We observe an increase in Stedin from 2009 to 2013 and then a sudden reduction followed by another increase. Importantly, we cannot judge how significant was the change but only the behavior along the years. If one looks at the tables before, it is easy to see that for Stedin the changes are a few cities more or less. Similarly, for Enexis and Liander, the changes do not represent a huge increase\/descrease. However, we may ask if the change from 2012 to 2013 means that some cities previously covered by Stedin passed to either Enexis or Liander.

Unless Enexis has already those cities covered then it could have increase the frequency of the cities, since we only count them by name. However this isnt the case, as one may check. Another question one may ask is which net manager is covering now these cities? (this ends up out of the dataset scope) ","57b774c5":"<a id=\"A24\"><\/a>\n## 2.4.

Each key is named after the net manager its data come from and its respective year. ","8cc74936":"To briefly explain the data we have selected, let us take the year 2010 above as an example. Each row indicates an observation related to one of the cities in the 10 largest municipalities list. The values for columns 100 and Not 100 are **counts** of the number of percentages equal to 100% or different from it. For the first row (index=0), its respective city has no observations in which there has been a delivery percentage different from 100%, and 11 observations with a delivery percentage of 100%. Notice that there are more rows than cities considered here, and this happens because some cities are present in the data of more than one net manager (enexis, stedin, liander) and we read each file individually to extract the information. ","bdb3f0e8":"As shown in Section 2.2, the number of connections in Eindhoven increased along the years, and at the same time its annual consume. Now, we look at the overall growth for all the 10 largest dutch municipalities in order to understand if there is any correlation between these two variables.\n\nIn Section 2.1, we created a table with the data of the annual consume for each city and year, i.e. *table_yearcity*. Here, we will build a table containing the information about the number of connections for each city and year. ","bf90677a":"<a id=\"A21\"><\/a>\n## 2.1.
