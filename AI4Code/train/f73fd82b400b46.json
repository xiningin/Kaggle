Analysis of Both Methods\n\n#### Results \n    For Input : Dress Pretty\n\n* TF-IDF :\n\n 1. I have two of these tops. the maroon and tan and white stripe. the material is great and the neckline lays great. it isn't too thick so i can wear it on cooler florida days. you can dress it up under a jacket or dress down with some jeans. \n 1. I love this top! the unique neck detail is awesome! i dress it up; i dress it casual. works for every adventure. more!!! \n 1. I got the red- it is a great color. this is one of those thin soft t shirts. it drapes really nicely and dresses up or dresses down. the only downside for me is that it takes a little extra effort in the washing department, but really not much- just have to line dry. \n 1. I bought this shirt in the neutral and white and love it. so many people compliment it. i usually pair it with white pants and cute wedges to dress it up (obviously with a statement necklace too). but the greatest thing about this shirt is the fact that you can also dress it down. the material is fabulous but i have not washed it yet so i am not sure if it is going to shrink (which i hope it doesn't because it is one of my favorite pieces).  unlike the other reviewer i did not think that the \n 1. I bought three of these tees. i kept the turquoise one only though. the color was pretty - a little drab but not too bad.  i love the style., the fabric is so soft and the one i wore was super comfy. the sleeves are cute without being too dramatic (like the ruffle sleeve tee - the sleeves were kind of ridiculous on me) now - the cons - the colors are pretty drab. i normally look better in more vibrant colors. the \"red\" i bought made me look like a corpse. it's not pretty at all. can't re \n \n\n* SVD using TF matrix\n \n 1. Very comfortable shirt, light weight top with lovely floral colors. great for spring\/summer with white jeans. love everything one september makes! \n 1. Great, comfortable tank. cool added detail in the straps. runs big so size down. i wear both a medium and large at retailer and got this in a small. \n 1. I usually wear small, ordered xs and it's still way too large. quality not that great, just meh, returning it. \n 1. I bought this shirt with the intentions of using it as a nursing top. to that effect, i'm happy with the purchase, and will get a lot of use out of it. i bought two on blush and one blue at the same time. however, i was surprised that the shirt was so open and loose. i thought it was just a deep v-neck, but the design actually really opens up once the hook and eye is undone at the top. you are then very exposed, there is nothing but an opened front shirt. this is convenient for a nursing mother, \n 1. Ordered online, just received this vest, so disappointed! love the garment but it is way too small. i wear a medium in most clothing and size 6 in a dress, but the medium in this vest isn't just snug it is definitely too small, even worn alone, i can't button it. i am now ordering the large and keeping my fingers crossed as i want to wear a tee under it. hoping i won't need to return both the m and the l, thinking of ordering an xl.\n\n#### Time\n\n   From the following code we can see that the SVD takes less time than TFIDF"}}
