Notably though, the population, labor force, and median household income\n  are comparable in how much they vary.\n  ","e5093631":"\n\n- Based on the barplots the population, labor force, and unemployment are visually almost identical, which strongly suggests\n  to me that they have the same distribution, but I'll check via boxplot later; notably though these variables having\n  a strong relationship with each other seems pretty logical.\n\n\n- The following 5 countys (in descending order by population) seem to have a significantly higher population, labor force, and\n  unemployment than the rest:\n\n - Montgomery County\n - Prince George's County\n - Baltimore County\n - Baltimore City\n - Anne Arundel County\n\n\n- The ratio of the mean to median gives you an idea of how skewed the different variables are, if the value is\n  near 1 than that would suggest that outliers are not pulling the variable too much. Every variable except the population,\n  labor force, and unemployment have values around 1, whereas those 3 seem to be slightly above 2; this phenomenon is likily in part due\n  to the above 5 countys.\n\n\n- The local personal income tax rate in Maryland varies from a minimum value of 2.25% up to a maximum of 3.2%.\n\n\n- Interestingly the county with the lowest bachelor degree attainment rate has the lowest median household income, while the\n  county with the highest rate actually has the highest median household income.\n\n\n- Somerset has the lowest Labor force and (Based on the histogram) has the 2nd lowest Median household income, while the\n  county with the highest Labor force also has the highest median price of homes.\n\n","bd6c945f":"Since the dataset is so small it's easy to visualize the different countys and see how they compare.
