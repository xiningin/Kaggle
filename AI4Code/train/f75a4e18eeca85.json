If you look at the neural network in the above figure, you will see that we have three features in the dataset: X1, X2, and X3, therefore we have three nodes in the first layer, also known as the input layer.\n\nThe weights of a neural network are basically the strings that we have to adjust in order to be able to correctly predict our output. For now, just remember that for each input feature, we have one weight.\n\n<img src =\"https:\/\/imgur.com\/mninr5z.png\">","fb2f7034":"<img src=\"https:\/\/imgur.com\/asJQHOg.png\">","fdb1a4a0":"<a id=\"Preprocess\"><\/a> <br> \n# **5.

We then compare the predicted output of the neural network with the actual output. Next, we update the weights and the bias in such a manner that our predicted output comes closer to the actual output. In this phase, we train our algorithm.\n\n<img src = \"https:\/\/imgur.com\/FI0R6lf.png\" width=\"1080\" height=\"1080\">","c8329b39":"<a id=\"Submission\"><\/a> <br> \n# **8.

Learning in a neural network is closely related to how we learn in our regular lives and activities \u2014 we perform an action and are either accepted or corrected by a trainer or coach to understand how to get better at a certain task. Similarly, neural networks require a trainer in order to describe what should have been produced as a response to the input. Based on the difference between the actual value and the predicted value, an error value also called **Cost Function** is computed and sent back through the system.\n\n<img src = \"https:\/\/imgur.com\/FQ2Tabx.gif\" width=\"1080\" height=\"1080\">","31b240ce":"# Table of Contents:\n\n**1.

For instance, in our example our independent variables are X1, X2 and X3. The dependent variable is Y.\n\nIn the beginning, the ANN makes some random predictions, these predictions are compared with the correct output and the error(the difference between the predicted values and the actual values) is calculated. The function that finds the difference between the actual value and the propagated values is called the cost function. The cost here refers to the error. Our objective is to minimize the cost function. Training a neural network basically refers to minimizing the cost function. We will see how we can perform this task.\n\nA neural network executes in two phases: **Feed Forward phase** and **Back Propagation phase**. Let us discuss both these steps in detail.","ded1d235":"<a id=\"Explorations\"><\/a> <br> \n# **4.
