These file objects can be any sort of file you have on your computer, whether it be an audio file, a text file, emails, Excel documents, etc. Note: You will probably need to install certain libraries or modules to interact with those various file types, but they are easily available. (We will cover downloading modules later on in the course).\n\nPython has a built-in open function that allows us to open and play with basic file types. First we will need a file though.

Alternatively, quickly create a simple .txt file with sublime text editor.","c17ddc1a":"You can read a file line by line using the readlines method.

But we'll break down what we did above. We said that for every line in this text file, go ahead and print that line. It's important to note a few things here:\n\n1. We could have called the \"line\" object anything (see example below).\n2. By not calling `.read()` on the file, the whole text file was not stored in memory.\n3. Notice the indent on the second line for print.
