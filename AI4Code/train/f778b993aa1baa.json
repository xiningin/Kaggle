Say, you want to extract the emojis from the reviews because they are a good predictor os the sentiment of the review.\n\nTake another example, the artificial assistants such as Siri, Google Now use information retrieval to give you better results. When you ask them for any query or ask them to search for something interesting on the screen, they look for common patterns such as emails, phone numbers, place names, date and time and so on. This is because then the assitant can automatically make a booking or ask you to call the resturant to make a booking.\n\nRegular expressions are very powerful tool in text processing. It will help you to clean and handle your text in a much better way.","4f601f9a":"### The five most important re functions that you would be required to use most of the times are\n\nmatch() Determine if the RE matches at the beginning of the string\n\nsearch() Scan through a string, looking for any location where this RE matches\n\nfinall() Find all the substrings where the RE matches, and return them as a list\n\nfinditer() Find all substrings where RE matches and return them as asn iterator\n\nsub() Find all substrings where the RE matches and substitute them with the given string","9b0f7266":"Let's define a function to match regular expression patterns"}}
