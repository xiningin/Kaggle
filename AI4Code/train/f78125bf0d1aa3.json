But why do we need normalization in the first place? K Means does clustering based on the spatial distance between each data point. We need to normalize our dataset so that one feature doesnot overweigh the other while calculating spatial distance.\n\nWe use standardScaler() to normalize our dataset.","1287f066":"We used K Means to understand patterns based on clusters on scaled dataset. Later did analysis using inertia\/elbow curve and Silhoutte Score to find optimal K value. But as we can see the scatterplots after applying (optimal k=3) clustering, still clusters are not as distinct as they are expected to be. This must be a result of many reasons. One such reason is 'CURSE OF DIMENSIONALITY'. Initially, when we applied KMeans on all the columns in dataset, we arrived at a point where we couldn't make clear statement even with optimal K value. Later when we tried KMeans on the selected columns based on which we want to cluster, we are able to see clear groups and label them as:\n\n* label 0: Low balance and low purchases - Fine group\n* label 1: Moderate to high balance and low purchases - Saving group\n* label 2: Moderate balance and moderate purchases - choosy group\n* label 3: Low to moderate balance and high purchases - Carefree group\n\nMaking this kernel was a learning process and I enjoyed this process.
