To try and tease out these 2 different types of players, I track several stats divided by their distance moved. The idea being that people who acquired a lot of weapons without walking far probably dropped in a highly contested zone.","ba21052a":"**Match Relative Stats**\n\nFor this kernel, I am tracking relative stats for each match.
