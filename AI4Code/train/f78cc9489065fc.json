These libraries all focus on building \"static\" visualizations: visualizations that have no moving parts. In other words, all of the plots we've built thus far could appear in a dead-tree journal article.\n\nThe web unlocks a lot of possibilities when it comes to interactivity and animations. There are a number of plotting libraries available which try to provide these features.\n\nIn this section we will examine `plotly`, an open-source plotting library that's one of the most popular of these libraries.","2f06e5f9":"Overall, `plotly` is a powerful, richly interactive data visualization library. It allows us to generate plots with more \"pizazz\" than standard `pandas` or `seaborn` output.\n\nThe tradeoff is that while `pandas` and `seaborn` are well-established, `plotly` is still new. As a result, and in particular, `plotly` documentation is much harder to and find and interpret; the office documentation on the `plotly` website uses a mix of different features for plotting, which makes it harder to use than it has to be.\n\nAdditionally, it's important to recognize when interactivity is useful, and when it is not. The most effective plots do not need to use hovers or tooltips to get their work done. As a result `plotly`, though extremely attractive, is rarely more *useful* than an equivalent plot in `pandas` or `seaborn`.","b01f5e9a":"# Exercises\n\nFor the following exercise, try forking and running this notebook, and then reproducing the chart that follows. Hint: `Attack` on the x-axis, `Defense` on the y-axis.","0618ea0f":"# Conclusion\n\nIn this section we looked at `plotly`, an interactive plotting library that produces very attractive-looking charts. It is one of a number of alternatives to `matplotlib`-based tools that provide first-class interactivity (`bokeh` is another one worth mentioning).\n\nIn the next section we'll look at another plotting library, `plotnine`, which is designed around a peculiar but powerful idea called the **grammar of graphics**.\n\n[Click here to go the next section, \"Grammar of graphics with plotnine\"](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/residentmario\/grammer-of-graphics-with-plotnine-optional).","0ac930de":"This chart is fully interactive. We can use the toolbar on the top-right to perform various operations on the data: zooming and panning, for example. When we hover over a data point, we get a tooltip. We can even save the plot as a PNG image.\n\nThis chart also demonstrates the *disadvantage* of this fancier plotting library. In order to keep performance reasonable, we had to limit ourselves to the first 1000 points in the dataset. While this was necessary anyway (to avoid too much overplotting) it's important to note that in general, interactive graphics are much, much more resource-intensive than static ones. It's easier to \"max out\" how many points of data you can show.\n\nNotice the \"shape\" of the `plotly` API. `iplot` takes a list of plot objects and composes them for you, plotting the combined end result. This makes it easy to stack plots.\n\nAs another example, here's a KDE plot (what `plotly` refers to as a `Histogram2dContour`) *and* scatter plot of the same data.","fa82df27":"We'll start by creating a basic scatter plot."}}
