Also make sure that for all of these movies, the `num_voted_users` is greater than 25,000.\nAlso add a `Rank` column containing the values 1 to 250 indicating the ranks of the corresponding films.\n    2.

Create three new dataframes namely, `Meryl_Streep`, `Leo_Caprio`, and `Brad_Pitt` which contain the movies in which the actors: 'Meryl Streep', 'Leonardo DiCaprio', and 'Brad Pitt' are the lead actors. Use only the `actor_1_name` column for extraction. Also, make sure that you use the names 'Meryl Streep', 'Leonardo DiCaprio', and 'Brad Pitt' for the said extraction.\n    2. Append the rows of all these dataframes and store them in a new dataframe named `Combined`.\n    3. Group the combined dataframe using the `actor_1_name` column.\n    4. Find the mean of the `num_critic_for_reviews` and `num_users_for_review` and identify the actors which have the highest mean.\n    5. Observe the change in number of voted users over decades using a bar chart. Create a column called `decade` which represents the decade to which every movie belongs to. For example, the  `title_year`  year 1923, 1925 should be stored as 1920s. Sort the dataframe based on the column `decade`, group it by `decade` and find the sum of users voted in each decade.

Some of the movies might have only one genre. In such cases, extract the single genre into both the columns, i.e. for such movies the `genre_2` will be the same as `genre_1`.\n2.
