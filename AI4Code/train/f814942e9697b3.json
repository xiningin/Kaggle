The player's direction is mostly steady with a slight tendency to the right as the ball is picking up speed. He is accelerating with no sudden change in direction unlike his orientation. His distance to the ball is increasing. The ball is losing speed until it is picked up by an opposing player. The distance to the ball is decreasing again as the opposing player is running towards him. We see the orientation of our player move to the left shortly before his direction shifts abruptly to the left. The distance between our player, the opposing player and the ball decreases further.","1b4b81b4":"# Scatterplots and KDE-Plots for a Specific Play","dc600879":"# Motivation\n\n**I mostly wanted to get familiar with the tracking data, as it's my first time of being exposed to this type of data.
