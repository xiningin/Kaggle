I think the reason to that may be the \"Game Pass\" which is a monthly subscription system that allows the players to play more than 100 games included by Microsoft(so independent from your wishlist), that has been updated periodically. Therefore,that could be leading the players to pay a smaller amount to the subscription system which grants access more than 100 games, rather than paying more to any individual game.\n\n\nI hope you found this notebook beneficial and had fun while reading.\n\n\n\nNote: I have nothing to declare for any conflict of interest.\n"}}
