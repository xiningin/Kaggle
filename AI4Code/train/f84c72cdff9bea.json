We will try to see if what the model predicted was reasonable or not. In this case the mistakes look reasonable (none of the mistakes seems obviously naive). This is an indicator that our classifier is working correctly. \n\nFurthermore, when we plot the confusion matrix, we can see that the distribution is heavily skewed: the model makes the same mistakes over and over again but it rarely confuses other categories. This suggests that it just finds it difficult to distinguish some specific categories between each other; this is normal behaviour.","bc1bbb12":"## Unfreezing, fine-tuning, and learning rates","df5c47c3":"It's astonishing that it's possible to recognize pet breeds so accurately!

Let's see if we can achieve a higher performance here. To help it along, let's us use larger images too, since that way the network can see more detail.
