The EM iteration alternates between performing an expectation (E) step, which creates a function for the expectation of the log-likelihood evaluated using the current estimate for the parameters, and a maximization (M) step, which computes parameters maximizing the expected log-likelihood found on the E step. These parameter-estimates are then used to determine the distribution of the latent variables in the next E step.\n\nSource: [Wikipedia](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Expectation%E2%80%93maximization_algorithm)\n","e5518b27":"<a id='sec32'><\/a>\n## A single Gaussion will not fit the data well\nCalculating the mean and standard deviation of the dataset shows it does not fit well","7d34ae02":"<a id='sec31'><\/a>\n## Gaussian Mixture Model of 2 Gaussians\nTwo Normal distributions $N(\\mu_1, \\sigma_1^2)$ and $N(\\mu_2, \\sigma_2^2)$. \n\nThere are 5 paramaters to estimate: $\\theta = (w, \\mu_1, \\sigma_1^2, \\mu_2, \\sigma_2^2)$ where $w$ is the probability that the data comes from the first normal probability distribution  (and 1-$w$) it comes from the second normal probability distribution) \n\nThe probability density function (PDF) of the mixture model is:\n\n$$f(x | \\theta) = w \\  f_1(x \\ | \\  \\mu_1, \\sigma_1^2) + (1 - w) \\  f_2 (x  \\ | \\  \\mu_2, \\sigma_2^2) $$  \n\nObjective is to best fit a given probability density by finding $\\theta = (w, \\mu_1, \\sigma_1^2, \\mu_2, \\sigma_2^2)$ through EM iterations\n\nLet try it out (code credits go to [ brianspiering](https:\/\/github.com\/brianspiering\/gaussian_mixture_models\/blob\/master\/intro_to_gmm_%26_em.ipynb))\n","6b9ef523":"<a id='sec6'><\/a>\n# If you want to explore this subject further\n\nIf you want to have a more formal understand of Gaussian mixture, I would recommend:  \nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=4vGiHC35j9s   \nif you want to have a less formal, please watch:  \nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=JNlEIEwe-Cg  \nEM Demystified: An Expectation-Maximization Tutorial:  \nhttps:\/\/vannevar.ece.uw.edu\/techsite\/papers\/documents\/UWEETR-2010-0002.pdf  \n\n","7c106e29":"![](http:\/\/)# Generate the data yourself \nSelect $\\mu_1, \\sigma_1$ and $\\mu_2, \\sigma_2$ to generate the data\n","85efff98":"<a id='sec2'><\/a>\n# How the EM algorithm works\n\nPlease have a look at this short video where it is explained very well on a 1-dimensional example: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=iQoXFmbXRJA  \n  \n    \n    \n\n![](http:\/\/www.wilsonmongwe.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/400px-EM.jpg)\n\nBelow slides explaining with a 2-dimensional example\n![alt text](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/0cTmOja.png \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n\n![alt text](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/8kQ9aa6.png \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n\n![alt text](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/A1j3lqB.png \"Logo Title Text 1\")","b641518e":"<a id='sec42'><\/a>\n## Find best Mixture Gaussian model"}}
