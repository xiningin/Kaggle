How does student engagement with online learning platforms relate to different geography? Demographic context (e.g., race\/ethnicity, ESL, learning disability)? Learning context? Socioeconomic status?\n5. Do certain state interventions, practices or policies (e.g., stimulus, reopening, eviction moratorium) correlate with the increase or decrease online engagement?","29e1a62e":"Given that most of the districts are in the suburbs and the small sample size, there is very little variation in locale within state.","378d34e2":"### Products data","5f026206":"Even though averages may be higly biased due to the skewed nature of the data, state and district operations (SDO) also took up a larger amount of time on average.","5ca7ac94":"Most spending is in the middle range of 8,000 - 10,000 per student although more than 50 percent of the data is missing.","a16c36a1":"Access and engagement is higher in districts where per pupill spending is higher. This is somewhat confounding since rural districts where the per pupil spending is in the middle range had the highest acess and engagement. ","a37d131a":"### Conclusion:\n\nIn terms of digital learning, it appears that a larger proportion of time at the median was spent on state and distict operations rather than learning. Moreover, just as digital learning was beginning to gain traction, the pandemic halted all progress measured by engagement. The higher level of engagement with products associated with state and district operations may be an indication that these products were more difficult to use or required more frequent page loads than products associated with learning and curriculum. One possibility for this discrepancy is that products with learning did not require much page loads and consisted mainly of students staring at the screen instead of interacting with the product.\n\nBased on the above findings, the general sense is that engagement is low - many students spend more time on administrative tasks (measured by SDO products) than learning (measured by LC products). Even before the pandemic, this struggle was obvious and although access and engagement began to increase it quickly reversed itself when the the pandemic began and never recovered to its original levels. We can conclude that the future of online learning is not too bright. ","8d59791b":"Likewise, the poorest districts (those with the highest share of students on free or reduced lunch) also spent the largest amount of engagement on state and distriction operations (SDO) instead of learning.","e5ddd881":"Similar to learning, engagement and access declined for the rest of the spring term and while access increased in the fall of 2020, engagement had only increased gradually.","c193a417":"However, engagement does not vary in the same way within districts with different shares of minority students. In districts that have the lowest minority shares, engagement is highest at the lowest and highest levels of spending while in districts with the highest share of minority students, engagement is slightly higher in the district with lower spending.","a1031278":"The engagement index also shows one extreme value of over 20000 when the median is around 2. Likewise percent access ranges from 0 to 100 percent with a median of 0.02 percent. This is a possible indication that averages might be biased by extreme values in the data.","e8293783":"However, the districts data has a lot of missing values. While state, locale, and pct_black\/hispanic have about 25 percent missing, almost 50 percent of per pupil expenditures are missing for the districts. While imputation is a possibility there is generally great variation at the school district level within a state, so substituting with state level averages would not be a good idea. Moreover, since the district id is anonymized we cannot utilize existing district level data for imputation.","1bc24eec":"There are many states with a small number of districts. Arizona, Florida, North Dakota and Minnesota only have data on one district.","9e643196":"Measured by median percent access however, learning (LC) and state and district operations (SDO) were at fairly similar levels although neither recovered to their pre pandemic levels.","e10b99a1":"The largest number of products is LC or Learning & Curriculum products, followed by CM or 'Classroom Management' and then SDO or 'School and District Operations'","50890548":"Over time, engagement was higher in districts with the highest and lowest shares of black or hispanic students. Engagement was initially higher for districts with the lowest share of minority students but fell more steeply over the pandemic."}}
