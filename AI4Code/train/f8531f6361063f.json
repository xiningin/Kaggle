","19fb599f":"`sklearn` has a few parameters that we can tweak to tune our model. \nWe won't be going into those different parameters in this notebook, \nbut if you want to give it a look, \n[here is the documentation.](https:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/generated\/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html)  \n\n### We need to figure out how well this model does\n\nThere are a few ways we are going to test for accuracy using a **Confusion Matrix** and the **Matthews Correlation Coefficient**.\n\n#### Confusion Matrix\n\nA Confusion Matrix shows us where the model is messing up. Below is an example from [Data School](https:\/\/www.dataschool.io). Confusion Matrices are great ways to visual your model's performance.\n\n![alt text](https:\/\/www.dataschool.io\/content\/images\/2015\/01\/confusion_matrix_simple2.png)","42e8cc8b":"So you know what the parameters mean:\n* `degree` refers to the degree of the polynomial\n* `gamma` refer to the influence of a single training example reaches\n> * with low values meaning \u2018far\u2019 and high values meaning \u2018close\u2019\n\nOnce we have the models defined, let's train them!","c9c50231":"What's going on with this V stuff?\nCredit Card information is a bit sensitive, and as such raw information had to be obscured in some way to protect that information.\n\nIn this case, the data provider used a method know as Principle Components Analysis (PCA) to hide those features that would be considered sensitive.  PCA is a very useful technique for dimension reduction. For now, know that this technique allows us to take data and transform it in a way that maintains the patterns in that data.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about PCA, [consider checking out this article](https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/a-step-by-step-explanation-of-principal-component-analysis-b836fb9c97e2). Unfortunately, there is a lot that we want to cover in Core and not enough time to do all of it. :(\n\nNext, let's get some basic statistical info from this data.","ccdc5084":"That wasn't too bad was it? Both Random Forests and SVMs are very easy models to implement, and their low training times means that the model can be used without the overheads associated with neural networks, which we will learn more about next week.\n\n## Credit Card Fraud Dataset\n\nAs always, we are going to need a dataset to work on! Credit card fraud detection is a serious issue, and as such is something that data scientists have looked into. This dataset is from a Kaggle competition with over 2,000 Kernals based on it. Let's see how well Random Forests can do with this dataset!\n\nLets read in the data and use `.info()` to find out some meta-data","6935b0c9":"## Iris Data Set\n\nThis is a classic dataset of flowers. The goal is to have the model classify the types of flowers based on 4 factors. \nThose factors are *sepal length*, *sepal width*, *petal length*, and *petal width*, which are all measured in cm. \nThe dataset is very old in comparison to many of the datasets we use, coming from a \n[1936 paper about taxonomy](https:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1111\/j.1469-1809.1936.tb02137.x).\n\n### Getting the Data Set\n\n`sklearn` has the dataset built into the the library, so getting the data will be easy. Once we do that, we'll do a test-train split.","1eedfef3":"### Some important points about this data \n\nFor most of the features, there is not a lot we can gather since it's been obscured with PCA. However, there are three features that have been left in for us to see. \n\n#### 1. Time\n\nTime is the amount of time from first transaction in seconds. \nThe max is 172792, so the data was collected for around 48 hours. \n\n#### 2. Amount\n\nAmount is the amount that the transaction was for. \nThe denomination of the transactions was not given, so we're going to be calling them \"Simoleons\" as a place holder. \nSome interesting points about this feature is the STD, or standard deviation, which is 250\u00a7. That's quite large, \nbut makes sense when the min and max are 0\u00a7 and 25,691\u00a7 respectively. \nThere is a lot of variance in this feature, which is to be expected. The 75% amount is only in 77\u00a7, \nwhich means that the whole set skews to the lower end.\n\n#### 3. Class\n\nThis tells us if the transaction was fraud or not. 0 is for no fraud, 1 if it is fraud. \nIf you look at the mean, it is .001727, which means that only .1727% of the 284,807 cases are fraud. \nThere are only 492 fraud examples in this data set, so we're looking for a needle in a haystack in this case.\n\nNow that we have that out of the way, let's start making this model! We need to split our data first","42de6e70":"Now we are see how the confusion matrices look like:","73a489a7":"<img\n    style=\"border-radius: 0.5em;\"\n    src=\"https:\/\/ucfai.org\/groups\/core\/fa19\/rf-svm\/banner.png\">\n\n<div class=\"col-12\">\n    <h1> A Walk Through the Random Forest <\/h1>\n    <hr>\n<\/div>\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 2em;\">\n    <p>by: \n        <a href=\"https:\/\/ucfai.org\/authors\/jarviseq\">@jarviseq<\/a> on Sep 25, 2019<\/p>\n<\/div>","f6af0ab2":"### Some Points about Training\n\nWith Random Forest and SVMs, training time is very quick, so we can finish training the model in realitively short order, \neven when our dataset contains 284,807 entries. This is done without the need of GPU acceleration, \nwhich Random Forests cannot take advantage of.\n\nThe area is left blank, \nbut there's examples on how to make the models earlier in the notebook that can be used as an example if you need it. \nWhat model and the parameters you choose are up to you, so have fun!","594d478e":"#### Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC)\n\nThis is used to find the quality of binary classification. Its based on the values found in the Confusion Matrix and tries to boil those values down to a single number. It is generally considered one of the better measures of quality for classification. MCC does not rely on class size, so in cases where we have very different class sizes, we can get a realiable measure of how well it did. \n\n\nMCC ranges from $[-1, 1]$. $-1$ represents total disagreement between the prediction and the observation, while $1$ represents prefect prediction. \nIn other words, the closer to $1$ we get the better the model is considered.","b81256ec":"### Now, what about SVMs?\n\nWe want to see how well SVMs can work on the Iris, so let's see it in action.\n\nFirst, let's define the models; one for `linear`, `poly` and `rbf`."}}
