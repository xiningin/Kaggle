Company\nthen I will compare all the companies together.\n\n#### EDA Result for Google Company:\n-  According to the data, Management has replied to that content\/feedback which has a bad score rather than replying to that which has a good score. Which is a **great sign** that **Google UPI** is more responsive toward bad experienced Customer.\n-  According to the data, The content which has a negative rating has got a **maximum number of votes** which tells that it can possible that the user how gave the votes also in some period of time **faced that same issue**. \n\n#### EDA Result for Paytm Company:\n-  According to the data, Management replied to the content\/feedback **ratio** is **balanced** in all the rating(score) categories. This means that Management has given replied not only to the low rating feedback but also to high rating feedback.\n- According to the data, The content that has a **negative rating** has got **most Upvotes** and the rating is in **decreasing order** when we move to a more positive rating and the least number of upvotes goes to 5rating feedback.\n\n#### EDA Result for PhonePay Company:\n- According to the data, Management replied to the content\/feedback ratio **is balanced** in all the rating(score) categories. This means that Management has given replied not only to the low rating feedback but also to high rating feedback. **But** Overall there are much **less number of feedbacks** in negative and average ratings which may be a good sign (not sure) that people are not facing much problem.\n- According to the data, Very Negative(0-1) and Average(2-3) reviews have got the largest nymber of Upvotes.\n\n## Overall Review of all Three Companies:\n- According to the data, **Paytm** had got the **most excellent(4-5 score) reviews** which means **user** who **use Paytm** are much **happy with their services** than Phonepay and Google. In **Sound number** comes **PhonePay** which is also **not too behind** and at least comes **Google** which needs to **improve its Services**.\n- According to the data, the **Most Negative (0-1 scores) rating** goes to **Google** as I said Google has to improve its services to compete with other companies, and the **least** most negative rating goes to **Paytm** which is a good sign. \n- According to the data, **Paytm** and **PhonePay** have got the **largest number of Feedback** compared to Google, **But** I think we cant really on these matrics as we don't have **more data** to **clarify** it.\n- According to the data, **Month** wise in  **November** *Phonepay* has the maximum number of feedbacks, **But** again I think we cant really on these matrics as we don't have **more data** to **clarify** it.\n\n### Overall **Paytm** currently provides the **Best Services** in terms of **UPI Payment** as it has the most number of ratings but **Phonepay** is also not much behind with **little more effort Phonepay** can **win** the game but **Google** has to **work harder** to compete with these companies as their **rating** is the **least** when compared to other two.

It also caters to the \u201cPeer to Peer\u201d collect request which can be scheduled and paid as per requirement and convenience.\n\nLooking forward, COVID-19 has provided a new opportunity for UPI and digital banking in general. India wants to decrease the amount of physical currency in circulation, and the pandemic has shown many people the virtues of online banking. For example, young adults wary of infecting their older parents have helped an older generation get on UPI and utilize everything it has to offer.\n\nUPI\u2019s recent boom focuses back to the platform\u2019s original goal: creating an even playing field for all people, regardless of background or socioeconomic status. In 10 or 20 years, it would not be surprising to see all banking conducted virtually. Therefore, it is crucial to create a solid infrastructure that eliminates a system of preferential treatment based on wealth. UPI is helping to fight that fight.\n\n## Goal Of This Kernal\nExplore Three Different UPI Companies under different umbrellas like usability, user interface, technical glitches and overall how satisfied the customers are with these apps.","50404a67":"## Featching the Numeric Column and finding all the NaN Values in Paytm dataset","62dfc7f2":"#### In all the 3 Datasets I removed [\"reviewCreatedVersion\",\"repliedAt\"] as i think this will not be used in future EDA Part.
