If you are familiar with these topics, just wait for the 3rd article in the series, where we get into machine learning.  \n\n**[Pandas](http:\/\/pandas.pydata.org)** is a Python library that provides extensive means for data analysis. Data scientists often work with data stored in table formats like `.csv`, `.tsv`, or `.xlsx`. Pandas makes it very convenient to load, process, and analyze such tabular data using SQL-like queries. In conjunction with `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn`, `Pandas` provides a wide range of opportunities for visual analysis of tabular data.\n\nThe main data structures in `Pandas` are implemented with **Series** and **DataFrame** classes. The former is a one-dimensional indexed array of some fixed data type. The latter is a two-dimensional data structure - a table - where each column contains data of the same type. You can see it as a dictionary of `Series` instances. `DataFrames` are great for representing real data: rows correspond to instances (objects, observations, etc.), and columns correspond to features for each of the instances.\n","738f36b5":"<center>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/habrastorage.org\/files\/fd4\/502\/43d\/fd450243dd604b81b9713213a247aa20.jpg\">\n## Open Machine Learning Course\n<center>Authors: [Yury Kashnitsky](https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/festline\/), Data Scientist @ Mail.Ru Group, Ekaterina Demidova, Data Scientist @ Segmento <br>\nTranslated and edited by [Yuanyuan Pao](https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/yuanyuanpao\/), [Christina Butsko](https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/christinabutsko\/), [Anastasia Manokhina](https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/anastasiamanokhina\/), [Sergey Isaev](https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/isvforall\/) and [Artem Trunov](https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/datamove\/) <br>All content is distributed under the [Creative Commons CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-nc-sa\/4.0\/) license.\n","5f625c75":"From the output, we can see that the table contains 3333 rows and 20 columns.\n\nNow let\u2019s try printing out the column names using `columns`:","59246a47":"It is possible to add a column more easily without creating an intermediate Series instance:","e4cf05f8":"\n### Grouping\n\nIn general, grouping data in Pandas goes as follows:\n","e58d1481":"Alternatively, we can also sort by multiple columns:","0e5baf05":"\n```python\ndf.groupby(by=grouping_columns)[columns_to_show].function()\n```","8cc8364c":"\nPerhaps, it is not so obvious from the summary table, but the picture clearly states that the churn rate strongly increases starting from 4 calls to the service center. \n\nLet\u2019s now add a binary attribute to our DataFrame \u2013 `Customer service calls > 3`.

This number, 85.8%, that we got with very simple reasoning serves as a good starting point (*baseline*) for the further machine learning models that we will build. \n\nAs we move on in this course, recall that, before the advent of machine learning, the data analysis process looked something like this. Let's recap what we've covered:\n    \n- The share of loyal clients in the sample is 85.5%. The most naive model that always predicts a \"loyal customer\" on such data will guess right in about 85.5% of all cases. That is, the proportion of correct answers (*accuracy*) of subsequent models should be no less than this number, and will hopefully be significantly higher;\n- With the help of a simple forecast that can be expressed by the following formula: \"International plan = True & Customer Service calls > 3 => Churn = 1, else Churn = 0\", we can expect a guessing rate of 85.8%, which is just above 85.5%. Subsequently, we'll talk about decision trees and figure out how to find such rules **automatically** based only on the input data;\n- We got these two baselines without applying machine learning, and they\u2019ll serve as the starting point for our subsequent models. If it turns out that with enormous efforts, we increase the share of correct answers by 0.5% per se, then perhaps we are doing something wrong, and it suffices to confine ourselves to a simple model with two conditions;\n- Before training complex models, it is recommended to manipulate the data a bit, make some plots, and check simple assumptions. Moreover, in business applications of machine learning, they usually start with simple solutions and then experiment with more complex ones.\n\n\n## 5.

About the course\n\nWith this article, we, [OpenDataScience](https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/11241268\/), launch an open Machine Learning course. This is not aimed at developing another *comprehensive* introductory course on machine learning or data analysis (so this is not a substitute for fundamental education or online\/offline courses\/specializations and books). The purpose of this series of articles is to quickly refresh your knowledge and help you find topics for further advancement. Our approach is similar to that of the authors of [Deep Learning book](http:\/\/www.deeplearningbook.org\/), which starts off with a review of mathematics and basics of machine learning \u2013 short, concise, and with many references to other resources. \n\nThe course is designed to perfectly balance theory and practice; therefore, each topic is followed by an **assignment** with a deadline in a week. You can also take part in several Kaggle Inclass **competitions** held during the course.\n\n### Syllabus\n1. Exploratory data analysis with Pandas\n1. Visual data analysis with Python\n1. Classification, Decision Trees, and k Nearest Neighbors\n1. Linear Classification and Regression\n1. Bagging and Random Forest\n1. Feature engineering and feature selection\n1. Unsupervised Learning: Principal Component Anslysis and Clustering\n1. Vowpal Wabbit: Learning with gigabytes of data\n1. Time series analysis with Python\n1. Gradient Boosting\n\n### Community\n\nOne of the most vivid advantages of our course is active community. If you join the OpenDataScience Slack team, you\u2019ll find the authors of articles and assignments right there in the same channel (#eng_mlcourse_open) eager to help you. This can help very much when you make your first steps in any discipline. Fill in [this form](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/forms\/d\/1_pDNuVHwBxV5wuOcdaXoxBZneyAQcqfOl4V2qkqKbNQ\/edit?usp=drive_web) to be invited. The form will ask you several questions about your background and skills, including a few easy math questions.\n\nWe chat informally, like humor and emoji. Not every MOOC can boast to have such an alive community. There is also a [subreddit](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ods_ai\/) designed for students participating in the course.\n\n### Prereqiusites\nThe prerequisites are the following: basic concepts from calculus, linear algebra, probability theory and statistics, and Python programming skills. If you need to catch up, a good resource will be [Part I](http:\/\/www.deeplearningbook.org\/contents\/part_basics.html) from the \"Deep Learning\" book and various math and Python online courses (for Python, CodeAcademy will do). More info is available on the corresponding [Wiki page](https:\/\/github.com\/Yorko\/mlcourse_open\/wiki\/Prerequisites:-Python,-math-and-DevOps).\n\n### What software you\u2019ll need\nAs for now, you\u2019ll only need [Anaconda](https:\/\/www.continuum.io\/downloads) (built with Python 3.6) to reproduce the code in the course. Later in the course, you\u2019ll have to install other libraries like Xgboost and Vowpal Wabbit.\n\nYou can also resort to the [Docker container](https:\/\/hub.docker.com\/r\/festline\/mlcourse_open\/) with all necessary software already installed. More info is available on the corresponding [Wiki page](https:\/\/github.com\/Yorko\/mlcourse_open\/wiki\/Software-requirements-and-Docker-container).\n\n\n## 2. Assignments\n\n- Each article comes with an assignment in the form of a [Jupyter](http:\/\/jupyter.org) notebook. The task will be to fill in the missing code snippets and to answer questions in a Google Quiz form;\n- Each assignment is due in a week with a hard deadline;\n- Please discuss the course content (articles and assignments) in the #eng_mlcourse_open cahnnel of the OpenDataScience Slack team or here in the comments to articles on Medium;\n- The solutions to assignments will be sent to those who have submitted the corresponding Google form.","31efc70d":"We can see that most of the users are loyal and do not use additional services (International Plan\/Voice mail).\n\nThis will resemble **pivot tables** to those familiar with Excel.
