We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be collaborating via the DSNet Online Meetup Slack group, which you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll automatically be invited to when you join the meetup. When study groups are underway the conversation there can be quite lively. Once you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve joined the Slack, introduce yourself on the #intro channel and join the #fastai channel for updates.\n\nWeekly help sessions via Zoom. We meet weekly via video conference to discuss the lessons, what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve learned so far, and any stumbling blocks. Participants are encouraged to join whether or not they have specific issues they need help wit","d1fa417e":"## Where to ask for help?\n\n- [DSNet Slack: join the channel #fastai](https:\/\/dsnetorg.slack.com\/join\/shared_invite\/enQtNTkyMDQ1NDM2ODU1LTEwM2NiYzA4NGM5OWNmYjEzMmFjMTJhNmZhYmI0ZjlhOTBhODc1NWE5Zjc4OGUzYjk2NDMzM2E2OTU2NDIzYzc)\n- Make sure to tag @init27\n- [Fastai forums](https:\/\/forums.fast.ai\/c\/part1-v3)"}}
