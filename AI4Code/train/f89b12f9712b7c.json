She has opted for free\/reduced lunch and had not completed any test preparation course. Her parents were some high school graduate.","67ad8d88":"Most students have completed the test preparation course among the top students who have scored more than 90 in each subject.","ef4aeb2d":"It is observed that most parents had 'some college' degree. Parents having 'master's degree' was the least. ","afefc7dd":"It is observed that the minimum score obtained in math is 0, in reading is 17 and in writing is 10.","e1a9d8b0":"Most students scoring in the lower bracket opted for free\/reduced lunch. The number of students who opted for free lunch was 5 times the number of students who opted for standard lunch. It shows that students scoring in the lower bracket come from poor families.","f48d947c":"### Conclusion","1ca295bc":"It is observed that in this dataset there are more data for females than males.","d35cb8bc":"The parents of majority of students who scored poorly had high school education. None of the student's parents had a masters degree.","714f5e29":"The most number of students come from group C, and the least number of students come from group A. ","e2cef1de":"Students whose parents have a college degree have performed better.","fbd1aac7":"The majority of the top scores have standard lunch. ","dffa7b93":"It is clear that most students had not completed any test course. Among the students who had completed a test preparation course, there were more female students than male students. ","b177cc88":"It is observed the highest score in math, reading and writing is 100 respectively.","2a0be3a5":"It is observed that students whose parents hold a master's degree tend to score the highest. This is followed by students whose hold a bachelor's degree. Essentially students whose parents have any college degree tend to do better.Students of parents who have just passed out from high school usually score the least in the class. This is probably because parents with higher education degrees can teach their children at home and solve their doubts and problems.","14853871":"Most students belong to group B, while the least number of students belong to group E and group A. ","45b6f5a7":"It is observed that female students score more than male students on an average in writing.","d4c78f3c":"I am assuming that the least score to pass in a subject is 30.","92172efd":"It is observed that the students who have failed in all the subjects had free\/reduced lunch. They hadn't completed any test preparation course and their parents had high school education. ","5137b9c6":"It is observed that students who have standard lunch usually score more on an average than students who have free or subsidised lunch. The feature 'Lunch' could be an indication of the family income of the student. If we assume that 'Lunch' is truly the indication of the family income then students who come from a poor family usually score poorly.","9ab971c7":"The following can be concluded:\n1. Gender of a student is not dependent on the overall performance of a student. However it is observed that even though there are 2 female students who have scored a perfect score = 100 in math, male students usually outperform female students in mathematics. Female students perform better than male students in reading and writing tests.\n2. Completion of the test preparation score is beneficial for the students. Thus students should try to complete it.\n3. Parent's education qualification matters when it comes to the performance of the students. It is observed that children of parents who hold a college degree - either a bachelors, masters or an associate degree perform better than children of parents who are high school graduates. \n4. It is also observed that students who belong to group E ethnicity perform better than students who belong to group B.\n5. A student's family income plays a huge role in the student's academic performance. Students who opted for standard lunch tended to score better than students who opted for free lunch.","fc587788":"It is observed that all the toppers belong to group E race\/ethnicity, the all have standard lunch and their parents have a degree. The top position is held by 2 female students and one male student. Among the three toppers, one student had completed test preparation course. ","63d67f44":"It is seen in the above three graphs that students from group E are among the best scorers in class. Second comes students from group D. Students from group A score the least on an average.","7038ba02":"It is evident that students who have completed test preparation course tend to score more than students who haven't completed any test preparation course.\n","5d19708a":"It is observed that more female students scored less than 30 in one or more subjects than male students. The number of female students is double the number of male students.","191c6001":"It is observed that there are no missing values.","0b34f2d3":"Almost all the students who scored less than 30 in any of the subjects did not take the preparation course.","27675159":"### Exploratory Data Analysis - Data Visualization","cd129162":"It is observed that male students score more than female students on an average in math.","f13c4caa":"It is observed that the number females students are almost more than double of the male students."}}
