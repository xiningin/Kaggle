In regression, \u201cmulticollinearity\u201d refers to features that are correlated with other features. Multicollinearity occurs when your model includes multiple factors that are correlated not just to your target variable, but also to each other.\n\nProblem:\n\nMulticollinearity increases the standard errors of the coefficients. That means, multicollinearity makes some variables statistically insignificant when they should be significant.\n\nTo avoid this we can do 3 things:\n\nCompletely remove those variables Make new feature by adding them or by some other operation. Use PCA, which will reduce feature set to small number of non-collinear features.","89b3e713":"# Correlation in data","a1d5e03c":"# In summary\nBased on the above analysis, we can conclude that:\n\n\u2018GrLivArea\u2019 and \u2018TotalBsmtSF\u2019 seem to be linearly related with \u2018SalePrice\u2019. Both relationships are positive, which means that as one variable increases, the other also increases. In the case of \u2018TotalBsmtSF\u2019, we can see that the slope of the linear relationship is particularly high. \u2018OverallQual\u2019 and \u2018YearBuilt\u2019 also seem to be related with \u2018SalePrice\u2019. The relationship seems to be stronger in the case of \u2018OverallQual\u2019, where the box plot shows how sales prices increase with the overall quality. We just analysed four variables, but there are many other that we should analyse. The trick here seems to be the choice of the right features (feature selection) and not the definition of complex relationships between them (feature engineering).\n\nThat said, let\u2019s separate the wheat from the chaff.","12623f91":"# Pivotal Features","6795c7ac":"# In summary\nIn my opinion, this heatmap is the best way to get a quick overview of features\u2019 relationships.\n\n- At first sight, there are two red colored squares that get my attention. The first one refers to the \u2018TotalBsmtSF\u2019 and \u20181stFlrSF\u2019 variables, and the second one refers to the \u2018GarageX\u2019 variables. Both cases show how significant the correlation is between these variables. Actually, this correlation is so strong that it can indicate a situation of multicollinearity. If we think about these variables, we can conclude that they give almost the same information so multicollinearity really occurs. Heatmaps are great to detect this kind of situations and in problems dominated by feature selection, like ours, they are an essential tool.\n\n- Another thing that got my attention was the \u2018SalePrice\u2019 correlations. We can see our well-known \u2018GrLivArea\u2019, \u2018TotalBsmtSF\u2019, and \u2018OverallQual\u2019, but we can also see many other variables that should be taken into account. That\u2019s what we will do next.","ed4b813a":"As we saw above there are few feature which shows high multicollinearity from heatmap.

SVM, Neural Network.\n\nBut filling missing values with mean\/median\/mode or using another predictive model to predict missing values is also a prediction which may not be 100% accurate, instead you can use models like Decision Trees and Random Forest which handle missing values very well.","cb12dfd9":"# Univariate Analysis","b79cbfcf":"We could get the following information: \n- Variable-Variable name * Type-There are 43 categorical columns and 38 numerical columns. \n- Missing value-How many missing values each column contains. For instance, Fence contains 80.8% * 1460 = 1180 missing tuples. Usually, some model does not allow the input data contains missing value such as SVM, we have to clean the data before we utilize it.\n- Target Value-The distribution of target value (SalePrice). According to the distribution of the target value, we could get the information that the target value is numerical and the distribution of the target value conforms to the norm distribution. Thus, we are not confronted with imbalanced classes problem. It is really great. \n- Guess-According to the columns\u2019 name, we reckon GrLivArea, YearBuilt and OverallQual are likely to be correlated to the target value (SalePrice).","6a340824":"# Overview of the data","cea8380c":"All garage related features are missing values in same rows. that means we can replace categorical variables with None and continuous ones with 0."}}
