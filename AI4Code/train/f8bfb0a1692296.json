Then there was a sudden drop in the release count of T.V shows. Again from 2015 the number of releases for TV shows increased. In the year 2020, the number of releases of T.V shows and movies are almost same but number of movie released is slightly more than number of T.V shows.\nIn the time period of 2010 to 2020(last decade)- The number of movie releases are much higher than T.V releases","d2bfea66":"The highest number of releases were in the year 2018.

There are less amount of releases for the shows that have longer play time.","ff72fddf":"From the above regression plot it can be determined that the relationship between release_year and number of releases cannot be determined. But still there is a slight negative relationship which means that the number of releases over the year ranging from 1950 to 2020 have decreased.","33c6d5bc":"#From the countplot we can see that number of movies have higher count than number of T.V shows\n    ","89a65871":"#from the graph above we can see that US, India,UK, Japan and South Korea are top 5 countries that release highest content.
