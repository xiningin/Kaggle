This weight is a statistical measure used to evaluate how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus. The importance increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document but is offset by the frequency of the word in the corpus. \n\n### One of the simplest ranking functions is computed by summing the tf-idf for each query term; many more sophisticated ranking functions are variants of this simple model.\n\n### Typically, the tf-idf weight is composed by two terms: the first computes the normalized Term Frequency (TF), aka. the number of times a word appears in a sentence, divided by the total number of words in that sentence; the second term is the Inverse Document Frequency (IDF), computed as the logarithm of the number of the sentences in the corpus divided by the number of sentences containing that word.\n\n### TF: Term Frequency, which measures how frequently a term occurs in a sentence. Since every sentence is different in length, it is possible that a term would appear much more times in long sentences than shorter ones. Thus, the term frequency is often divided by the sentence length (aka. the total number of terms in the sentence) as a way of normalization:\n\n### TF(t) = (Number of repition of words in sentence) \/ (Total number of words in sentences).\n\n### IDF: Inverse Document Frequency, which measures how important a word is. While computing TF, all words are considered equally important. However it is known that certain words, such as \"is\", \"of\", and \"that\", may appear a lot of times but have little importance. Thus we need to weigh down the frequent terms while scale up the rare ones, by computing the following:\n\n### IDF(t) = log_e(Total number of sentences \/ Number of sentences containing words).\n\n"}}
