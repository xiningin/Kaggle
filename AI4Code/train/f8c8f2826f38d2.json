This is a better representation of the data we normally collect when we randomly collect a sample of bacteria, e.g. from a patient population or from the environment. \n\nIn this scenario, we expect to see the ancestor on the left hand side of the tree, representing 0 mutations. We expect to see each generated sequence a certain distance from the Ancestor, with sequences on the same part of the x-axis if they are identical to the ancestor, and sequences with the most chances to mutate sitting further to the right. \n\nThe number of mutation opportunities and the distance from the ancestor won't line up perfectly for two reasons:\n1.
