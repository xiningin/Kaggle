the survey responses contain a wealth of information, we'll limit our analysis to the following areas:\n\n- Demographics of the survey respondents and the global programming community\n- Distribution of programming skills, experience, and preferences\n- Employment-related information, preferences, and opinions\n\nLet's select a subset of columns with the relevant data for our analysis.","c425595a":"# Inferences and Conclusions\n\nWe've drawn many inferences from the survey. Here's a summary of a few of them:\n\n- Based on the survey respondents' demographics, we can infer that the survey is somewhat representative of the overall programming community. However, it has fewer responses from programmers in non-English-speaking countries and women & non-binary genders.\n\n- The programming community is not as diverse as it can be. Although things are improving, we should make more efforts to support & encourage underrepresented communities, whether in terms of age, country, race, gender, or otherwise.\n\n\n- Although most programmers hold a college degree, a reasonably large percentage did not have computer science as their college major. Hence, a computer science degree isn't compulsory for learning to code or building a career in programming.\n\n- A significant percentage of programmers either work part-time or as freelancers, which can be a great way to break into the field, especially when you're just getting started.\n\n- Javascript & HTML\/CSS are the most used programming languages in 2020, closely followed by SQL & Python.\n\n- Python is the language most people are interested in learning - since it is an easy-to-learn general-purpose programming language well suited for various domains.\n\n- Rust and TypeScript are the most \"loved\" languages in 2020, both of which have small but fast-growing communities. Python is a close third, despite already being a widely used language.\n\n- Programmers worldwide seem to be working for around 40 hours a week on average, with slight variations by country.\n\n- You can learn and start programming professionally at any age. You're likely to have a long and fulfilling career if you also enjoy programming as a hobby.\n\n- **SQL and Python** are 2nd and 5th most popular language in India which is used for Data Science. Where as **R is 17th** most popular language in India.\n### Way ahead\n**Will compare these finding with kaggle survey finding, as it more targeted towards data science community**","94b9fb37":"There seems to be a problem with the age column, *as the minimum value is 1* and *the maximum is 279*.   \nThis is a common issue with surveys: responses may contain invalid values due to accidental or intentional errors while responding.

Respondents may not feel encouraged to provide accurate, honest answers    \nb.

The number of respondents who choose to respond to a survey question may be different from those who chose not to respond, thus creating bias.  \n\n## `Errors in Survey dataset`\n1. **Survey error** refers to `mistakes made in the construction and implementation of the survey instrument, as well as the interpretation of results.` Survey error is associated with `completeness, interpretability of the data, and the generalizability of the results.` *This type of error affects the validity of the measurement and what is called* ***measurement error***. Survey error is avoided, to some extent, by carefully designing the study, creating a comprehensive set of well-crafted survey items, and properly interpreting and presenting the results. \n2. **Purpose Creep Error** At times researchers (or clients) will add items to a survey that don\u2019t directly align with the needs and purposes of the study.\n3. **Sampling Error** This occurs when mistakes are made selecting a sample. Sampling error typically occurs when a specific subgroup within the population is under- or overrepresented in the sample. When this happens, the results obtained from the survey are not generalizable. This is because the characteristics of respondents in the sample do not match proportionally with the characteristics of those in the population. This can easily happen with small samples, especially when there are a number of small subgroups within the population. \n4. **Item Nonresponse Error** This happens when a participant fails to answer all the questions on a survey. It can happen by accident or intentionally. Nonresponse is unfortunate when you are administering a questionnaire but does not necessarily invalidate the results; the results depend on how many respondents failed to answer a specific question. \n\n## `Common Forms of Response Bias`\n1. **Response bias** is a general term that describes the ways a respondent may be influenced when self-reporting their answers on a survey. Bias affects the accuracy and reliability of the results. There are several ways in which an individual\u2019s response may be inaccurate. The inaccuracy, or bias, may be deliberate or subconscious on the part of the respondent; it is the result of a respondent being unduly influenced to respond in a certain way, or a respondent\u2019s unwillingness to answer the questions honestly. Bias can be caused when items are unclear or poorly constructed but can also occur as a result of the response scale selected for participants to use when they provide their answers. Never underestimate the propensity of individuals to misunderstand what is being asked or otherwise provide information that is inaccurate to some degree.\n2. **Random Response Bias** Random response bias can occur when a respondent honestly does not know the answer to the question but answers anyway.\n3. **Demand Characteristic Bias** A demand characteristic is used to describe specific cues in research that may inadvertently influence a participant\u2019s response.\n4. **Central Tendency Bias** This bias refers to the tendency of some individuals to avoid responding in extreme ways.\n5. **Mood Bias and Emotional Mind Sets** One\u2019s mood or mindset will affect the way responses are provided. \n6. **Item and Option Order Effect Bias** Order bias can be the result of both item order and response option order. The order in which survey items are presented can affect a respondent\u2019s answers due to a priming effect. People tend to contextualize their responses. Because of this, survey questions that come just before a particular query may provide information that respondents will use as context in formulating their subsequent answers. If a different primer was presented, the responses may be significantly different.\n`Two common response biases associated with response option order` are **primacy and recency bias**.**Primacy bias** is the tendency for respondents to pick one of the first options presented to them. This can happen when a respondent quickly reads through the survey and picks one of the first response options they agree with.**Recency bias** is the tendency to pick an answer option presented at the end of a list. For example, in a long list of options, the choices respondents read last are more memorable to the respondent as they select an answer.  \n7. **Prestige Bias** This bias is related to social desirability bias as it is based on an individual\u2019s personal desire to be seen in a positive light. This bias is based on personal feelings, not a general instinct for conformity. \n8. **Acquiescence or Agreement Bias** This bias is like conformity bias. However, unlike conformity bias, in this case the respondent will, in general and inadvertently, agree with statements. With this bias, participants tend to select a positive response option or disproportionately indicate a positive connotation. `This bias will skew results towards the positive.`","a8954e63":"#### Analyse with respect to **UndergradMajor**","57035212":"It seems these columns store few object data type like :  \"Less than 1 year\",'More than 50 years' , 'Younger than 5 years' , 'Older than 85' etc  \nwe can solve this problem in 2 way\n1.

However, we need to be careful to specify this is a probability density and not a probability. The difference is the probability density is the probability per unit on the x-axis. To convert to an actual probability, we need to find the area under the curve for a specific interval on the x-axis. Somewhat confusingly, because this is a probability density and not a probability, the y-axis can take values greater than one. The only requirement of the density plot is that the total area under the curve integrates to one. I generally tend to think of the y-axis on a density plot as a value only for relative comparisons between different categories.\nfor [reference](https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/histograms-and-density-plots-in-python-f6bda88f5ac0) \n\n\n## `Gender`\n\nLet's look at the distribution of responses for the Gender.
