But after the Chinese Communist Revolution in 1949, the Chinese Communist leader declared the creation of People's Republic of China, or China as we know of today. The rise of communism resulted in a significant improvement in womens social status as according to the communist doctrine, all workers were supposed to be accorded equal worth, regardless of their gender. Moreover, when considering the direction of a new republic in 1949, the Chinese leadership understood that to make a new China successful, the people would have to be fit and healthy to help them rebuild the country and hence promoted and emphasised the importance of physical education throughout the education system and to broader society.\n\nStill political unrest between now China and Taiwan and their disputes in the International Olympic Commitee (IOC) led to only 1 athlete, Wu Chuanyu, to participate in the 1952 Olympic Games in Helsinki, while China altogether withdrew from the 1956 Olympic Games in Melbourne. Later, China withdrew from IOC itself in 1958 and Taiwan as we know it now was recognized as China. This continued till the 1980 Olympic Games due to various [political reasons](http:\/\/www.china.org.cn\/english\/null\/116819.htm).\n\nAfter 32 years of hiatus, China appeared on the Olympics stage with a bang. 215 competitors, 132 men and 83 women, took part in 105 events in 19 sports. The first gold medal to be awarded at the Los Angeles Olympics was also the first-ever medal to be won by an athlete from China when Xu Haifeng won the 50 m Pistol event. Li Ning, a gymnastics won 3 gold, 2 silver, and 1 bronze, earning him the nickname \"Prince of Gymnasts\" in China. \n\nIt was around this time that women in sports were gaining popularity in the world and women only events were being introduced in the olympics. Under its communist policy, China saw this as a way to dominate and gave equal importance to men\u2019s events and women\u2019s events, which not only led to equal representation, but also equal recognition on the world stage, turning them into one of the giants of Olympics.\n\nHere's a figure of how the participation trend has moved for Chinese men and women over the years:","821993b8":"Let's analyze what the above maps tell us:\n- Like their male contemporaries, female USA athletes dominate the world in the Summer Olympics, both in terms of participation (4239) and their medal count (1564). That's about 37% of the participants winning a medal.\n- Germany and Russia complete the top 3 in terms of both female representation and medal count in the world, with Russia performing much better between the two.\n- Here's something of intrigue. China sends almost equivalent number of female (2484) and male (2512) athletes to the Summer games, but the female athletes(603) perform almost twice as better than their fellow male (310) olympians. We shall have a detailed look at this in a later section.\n- Canada, United Kingdom and Australia are also well represented at the games in terms of female athletes, but only about 11% of Canadian (283 out of 2486) and 12% of United Kingdom (375 out of 2922) women rake in a medal. The Canadian ratio is actually better than their male counterparts but the women from United Kingdom have historically underperformed in comparison to the men (about 20% medal winners). The winning-participation ratio for Australian women is in lieu with the male contemporaries (about 20%).\n- South American and African countries are again poorly represented at the games both in terms of participation and medal count, with a number of countries not having a single female olympic medalist. Only Brazil is an exception in the South American countries in terms of decent representation.\n- India has very low female athlete participation when compared to their huge population.\n\nIts great to see that all the countries have had female representation at the Summer Olympics. This was not the case before the olympics in London, 2012, where Brunei, Saudi Arabia and Qatar all had sent female athletes as a part of their delegations for the first time.","e4a70c1b":"### 5.3 Women over age 40 in Summer Olympics","481bc5c3":"### 3.1 Number of participating countries over years","351f7ce5":"Again, we will look at male and female medal winners separately for both summer and winter olympics.","72133aa9":"<a id=7.2><\/a>","bf6873c7":"There seems to hardly be any participation from women over 40 in the Winter Olympics, with Curling the only sport having any significant participation.

They were dedicated to the Olympian gods and were staged on the ancient plains of Olympia. They continued for nearly 12 centuries, until Emperor Theodosius decreed in 393 A.D. that all such \"pagan cults\" be banned.\n\nThe Olypic Games are the leading international sporting events featuring summer and winter sports competitions in which thousands of athletes from around the world participate in a variety of competitions. The Olympic Games are held every four years, with the Summer and Winter Games alternating by occurring every four years but two years apart.\n\nIn this kernel, my goal is to show how the Olympic Games have developed over the years, changing participation trends, physical winning characteristics, geographic participation trends, special cases of interest, et al.\n\nThe data was scrapped by [**Randi H Griffin**](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/heesoo37) from www.sports-reference.com and can be found [here](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/heesoo37\/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results\/home)\n\n**Note:** This is my first ever visualization task and I would appreciate any constructive criticism or advice anyone has. I have removed all exploratory steps from the notebook for easier navigation.","e18c54e1":"The above figure has some interesting aspects. Let's look into the reasons for these events:\n - **Athens, 1906**: The 1906  Intercalated Games or 1906 Olympic Games was an international multi-sport event that was celebrated in Athens, Greece. Whilst medals were distributed to the participants during these games, the medals are not officially recognized by the IOC today.\n - **WW I**: No games were held in 1916 due WW I spanning from 1912-1920.\n - **WW II**: There was a twelve year hiatus (1936-1948), in which no Olympics were held due to WW II\n - **Montreal, 1976**: International politics played a part leading to low attendance due to boycott by 25 African Nations. They were all protesting New Zealand's sporting links with South Africa.\n - **Moscow, 1980**: International politics again played a part, as 66 nations refused to send teams to Moscow, protesting Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan.","667b12a6":"<a id=4.2><\/a>","7d931269":"### 4.2 Female winners in Summer Olympics","7bffcc43":"So, we have 208 unique countries that have participated in the Olympics over the years.

While the maps above showed that they had good representation at both Summer and Winter games, let's see how was their performance.","a9cb4fce":"### 4.4 Female winners in Winter Olympics","0797cf39":"<a id=5><\/a>","88df1e1d":"### 7.1 Emergence of Chinese women in Olympics ","4c4f6505":"So the most common winter sport for men over 40 are Bobsleigh and Curling, which make a lot of sense as they are highly skill-dependent sports.\n\nMoreover, notice how both the count for participation and winning is a lot less here when compared to athletes over 40. This fact puts the trend of increasing winning-participation ratio for men into perspective as the sample size itself is too small to make an adequate comparison.","446321e0":"### 6.4 Women participation\/medal winners per country in Winter Olympics","c997f048":"As evident from the chart above, Chinese women regularly outshine their male counterparts, with the pinnacle happening in the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, where Chinese women won 7 more Gold medals than their male counterparts.\n\nThe numbers for Winter Olympics are even more striking, with the number of women participants easily outnumbering the number of men participating, and also raking in more medals.","6dc70ea5":"<a id=5.1><\/a>","be681a55":"<a id=3.3><\/a>","4546fe0b":"Analogous to their summer counterparts, most athletes participate and win winter olympics competetions when they are aged between 20-30. Lets's look at their winning-participation ratio as well.","bf8adfae":"Few characteristics of the figure above:\n - The first Olympic Games to feature female athletes was the 1900 Games in Paris, with **H\u00e9l\u00e8ne de Pourtal\u00e8s** of Switzerland becoming the first woman to compete at the Olympic Games as well as the first female Olympic champion by being a part of the winning team in the first 1 to 2 ton sailing event.\n - Although, the rise in number of women partipants mirrored the rise in the number of men participation (proportional), the total number of women participating in the games have historically been low due to less events being open to women for participation. Moreover, perhaps as an indicator of the time, a lot of countries were skeptical in sending women athletes to Olympics. (We will dive into it a later point in the notebook.)\n - In 1990, **Ms Flor Isava Fonseca** was the first woman to be elected on to the IOC Executive Board. Subsequently, in 1991 , a historic decision was made by the IOC: Any new sport seeking to be included on the Olympic programme had to include women\u2019s events. This has led to the women participation increasing dramatically in the Olympics from 1992, whereas the men participation has become stagnant\/gone down due to the number of events reaching a saturation point and most countries trying to adequately represent participants (men and women) in all the events.","935f29fe":"In similar vein to the men, women also seem to participate and win in events with higher skill requirement than physical prowess. ","91c9037f":"<a id=4.4><\/a>","44fd82c8":"While even now, one sees countries giving more importance to the men\u2019s events and at times neglecting the women\u2019s events. China bucks the trend here by producing quality women performers who sometimes outshine the men\u2019s contingent by winning more medals than them, as seen below:","ea29987e":"Some interesting aspects that can be observed from the above two maps:\n- Many countries, especially from the African continent do not send any male athletes to the Winter Olympics.\n- While Russia has sent the third highest number of male athletes to Winter Olympics, they have raked in the most number of medals.\n- USA sends the highest number of male athletes to the Winter Olympics, followed by Germany. They come in at second and third position in terms of aggregate medal counts.\n- Canada is fourth, both in terms of number of male participants and medal winners, winning an impressive 374 medals in between 1796 participants.\n- Nordic countries Finland, Sweden and Norway have, perhaps unsurprisingly, had good representation and medal winner counts in the Winter Olympics. But this was also the case in Summer Olympics, which was unexpected (atleast for me). Let's compare their performance on both Summer and Winter Olympics later.\n- No male athlete from countries from Africa or South America has won a medal. The spec of land on South American continent showing that a medal was won, is French Guiana and is an overseas territorial collectivity of France rather than being a country.\n- Eventhough Australian men have participated in significant numbers (375), they have not been much successful (9 medals), which is about 2.5% reward-participation ratio. It is still better than Kazakhstan, who have won 5 medals over 363 participants (almost 1%).\n","e62a700a":"<a id=4.1><\/a>","7655135c":"Next, let's analyse the winter olympics for athlete ages in a similar fashion to above.","b4ddbde1":"Woah! That's surprising. The figure gives us a few insights: \n - Except for the athletes in their teen years, the winning-participation ratio for men seems to decline slowly in comparison to their women counterparts.\n - Both, men and women, maintain a healthy winning probability of 0.16 or more for ages 20-40.\n - The winning-participation ratio for the teen years is less than other age ranges. This can be due to inexperience at such a high level of sports competition.\n - The probability of women winning declines considerably with age.","22ef8ad1":"Let's do a deeper analysis of athletes participation!","c8b8fb86":"As evident, there has been an almost equal rise in the participation of Chinese men and women.","2c84452c":"<a id=5.3><\/a>","8c56b476":"<a id=6.4><\/a>","6ac438aa":"The above figures indicate that there is usually a linear relationship between height and weights (Expected!), with most of the winners having around 182 cm height and 80 kg weight. But a few curious result were observed:\n - The Height of all Medal winners is distributed normally, while the weights are slightly right-skewed.\n - Athletes who did not win any medal tend to have lighter weight (Max density at around 75, less spread as well)\n - None of the winners were less than about 40 kg in weight.\n \n**Note**: These are all priliminary observations, a better understanding can be developed by comparing the same for individual Sport categories ","71a78f13":"## 1. Introduction","22a3b135":"## 5. Age of medal winners","7b4feef3":"Features of the figure:\n - **Pre 1924**: Initially, the host countries decided the sporting schedule and hence a lot of sports such as Cricket(1900 \u2013 Paris), Croquet(1900 \u2013 Paris), Rackets(1908 \u2013 London), Tug of war(1900-1920), etc led a short life. In 1924, IOC assumed this role, hence standardizing the competetive sports.\n - **1924-2000**: A steady rise in the number of competitive games was seen from 1924 to the 2000 Olympics.\n - **Post 2000**: The growth of number of events levels off for the summer games at around 2004. This is probably due to the variety of games reaching a saturation point. (It cannot increase continuously!). \n - **Winter vs Summer**: In all the above figures, we see that the values for winter games is comparatively lower than that of summer games. This is because of the less variety of winter games being available as well as the number of countries which participate in them being less, with the weather of Southern countries playing a part.","569b4b56":"Wow!

Antarctica is obvious but why not from Greenland? Turns out Greenland is an autonomous territory of Denmark and does not field its own Olympic team. \n- USA has sent the most number of Male athletes to the Summer Olympics, with almost 1\/3rd of them raking in a medal for their efforts. Impressive!\n- Germany, France, United Kingdom and Russia are the next major countries to send male athletes to the games, with Russia performing significantly better than their male counterparts from other countries and winning a medal with 35% of their male athletes.\n- Europe, overall has been well represented at the games, while the African countries, except for Egypt and South Africa have had very low representation. This is probably due to, ahem, history. The same is reflected in the ability to win from the athletes of Africa, as a number of countries have never won a medal.\n- Australia has had good number of male athletes representation at the games (4598) but less than 20% of their male athletes have raked in a medal (791).\n- South American countries have not sent a large number of male athletes to the games, except for Brazil and Argentina, and this is representative in their medal count as well. Bolivia is the only South American country that has failed to win a single medal through their male athletes at the Summer Olympics. \n- China and India, even with their huge population advantage have had an average number of male representatives at the Summer Olympics and hence have not performed well in the Medal categories as well (In contrast to their huge population)","01225dcb":"A few notable characteristics of the above figures, both in isolation and in comparison to their Summer Olympics counterpart:\n - Eventhough most of the medal winning mens in winter olympics have similar height (around 180 cm) and weight (around 80 kg) to their summer olympic counterparts, the overall spread of winners across both the weight and height spectrum is less. This can either be due to the lesser sample space available (the number of participants in winter olympics are far less than the summer olympics) or, due to the more rigorous physical demands of winter sports.\n - The height and weight of winners is normally distributed and hence do not show any particular inclination.\n - The winners seem to have a much more compact cluster in terms of height (about 150-205 cm) and weight (about 40-130 kg) and so we can confidently say that male competitors outside this range will not have a podium finish (There are no outlier winners!).\n - Male athletes with less weight have lesser chances to win (Right skewed distribution for weight in non-winners)","f0456b0c":"<a id=7.1><\/a>","60acdf65":"[1.

All these sports have more requirement of technique than physical brawn and hence it makes sense for them to participate in such categories.\n\nAlso, Art Competitions? When did Olympics have Art Competitions? We'll investigate this in a later section.","6a436868":"Winning-participation ratio:","db6d069c":"Analysis of the above maps:\n- USA(1294), Germany(1197), Canada(1077) and Russia(1040) have been the most well represented countries in terms of female athletes at the Winter Olympics. Even with such differences in the number of women representing the countries, they can hardly be segregated in terms of total medal counts with Russia(242 medals) leading everyone, followed closely by USA(241 medals), Germany (239 medals) and Cananda (237 medals).\n- Similarly to men, African and South American women have not won any medals for their efforts at Winter Olympics.\n- Female athletes(508) from China outnumber their male (322) counterparts at the winter olympics.\n- Nordic countries are again well represented both in terms of participation and medal count.\n- Japan has had a lot of male as well as female participants at the winter olympics.","e282347e":"### 5.1 Age Distribution for Summer Olympics","3424cca2":"<a id=7><\/a>","bbbd0336":"The above figure shows that the majority of athletes, may they be men or women, win medals when aged between 20-30, which seems ideal as the human body is in peak condition during those years. But the highest number of participants were also from that age range and so we need to have a look at the winning-participation ratio to have a true idea of how age is related to a podium finish.\n\nAlso, it seems that a few men won medals even in their 40s. We'll have a look at it later.","fe84fddb":"### 5.5 Men over age 40 in Winter Olympics","2e0384d2":"### 6.3 Men participation\/medal winners per country in Winter Olympics","ea4133fb":"### 3.2 Number of events over the years","4c513c37":"Let's start by looking at how many men have participated in the summer olympics","4639b35f":"### 5.2 Men over age 40 in Summer Olympics","1fba41f2":"<a id=6.1><\/a>","3e2cebc0":"Again, we can see that there is a linear relationship between height and weights , with most of the winners having around 170 cm height and 60 kg weight. A few curious result were observed:\n\n - The height and weight values for female athletes is less than that for male athletes. (Expected as the physical builds are different)\n - Both, height as well as weight for female athletes seems normally distributed.\n - Female Athletes who did not win any medal tend to have lighter weight as well as lesser height than their counterparts who secured a podium finish. The distribution of height and weight for medal winners is also more concise than other competitors.\n - Taller women have better chance of winning a medal than losing (as per the spread, non-winners tend to tail off at 185 cm height)","7f50bf0d":"## 6. Geographic Trends","84092796":"<a id=6><\/a>","b5f3a0fd":"We see some new characteristics in this figure. Let's look into them:\n - **Los Angeles 1932**: The Games were held during the worldwide Great Depression and many nations and athletes were unable to pay for the trip to Los Angeles; fewer than half the number of participants in the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam returned to compete in 1932.\n - **Melbourne 1956**: A number of International events played a part. Egypt, Iraq, and Lebanon announced that they would not participate in the Olympics in response to the Suez Crisis when Egypt was invaded by Israel, the United Kingdom, and France after Egypt nationalised the Suez canal. Meanwhile, in 1956 the Soviet Union crushed the Hungarian Revolution, and the Soviet presence at the Games led to the withdrawal of the Netherlands, Cambodia, Spain, and Switzerland. Less than two weeks before the 22 November opening ceremony, the People's Republic of China chose to boycott the event because the Republic of China had been allowed to compete. Although the number of countries participating (67) was almost the same as in 1952 (69), the number of athletes competing dropped sharply.","afdc7476":"As shown before, china is the only country which has had similar representation for both men and women at the Olympic Games, why can this be?
