Here we can see that except for `area`, all the columns have small integer values. So it is extremely important to rescale the variables so that they have a comparable scale. If we don't have comparable scales, then some of the coefficients as obtained by fitting the regression model might be very large or very small as compared to the other coefficients. This might become very annoying at the time of model evaluation. So it is advised to use standardization or normalization so that the units of the coefficients obtained are all on the same scale. As you know, there are two common ways of rescaling:\n\n1. Min-Max scaling \n2.
