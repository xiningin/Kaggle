Originally I had intended to do sentiment analysis with MonkeyLearn, but the free account was too restrictive so I used MeaningCloud instead. These are the topics I analyzed:\n\nTrending topics:\n1. Daniel Radcliffe\n2. Papa Mochi\n3. #BlackLivesMatter\n4. #BlakeLivesMatter\n5. #ShutDownSTEM\n6. B Simone\n7. Stephen Miller\n8. Vita\n9. Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone\n10. Rage Against the Machine\n\nSentiment analysis for tweets doesn't tell you how the person feels about the topic, but rather the general sentiment of the tweet itself. So this wont be used to analyze feelings about the topics, instead I'm looking at whether or not trending topics inspire strong feelings (either positive or negative) in general. The sentment was classified as either Positive (P), very positive (P+), negative (N), very negative (N+), neutral (NEU), or no sentiment (NONE)\n","da0fbb70":"I had expected all topics to have a small percentage of none and neutral. For the topics this was not the case for it, it looks like it may have been due to larger number of tweets in other langauges besides English and Spanish, and larger numbers of images, which got categorized as \"none\". It was also clear that the classifier could not recognize sarcasm. \n\nExamples of classifier successes:\n\nRT @BeauTFC: I mean sure sex is great and all, but have you ever seen \"capitol hill autonomous zone\" trending?\tP+\n\nRT @jeonridley: i love you so much daniel radcliffe https:\/\/t.co\/tlLj7oMmFS\tP+\n\nRT @BRRN_Fed: Good morning to the Seattle Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone! \ud83c\udf1e\u2615\ufe0f\u270a https:\/\/t.co\/6UTD8FSv1y\tP\n\nRT @thelindsayellis: This was nice to see. https:\/\/t.co\/mEj1igDsyD\tP\n\n\"RT @anarchomastia: ALERTA: Cops have taken away some of the barricades at the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone. we need more barricade materials to keep the area safe: please if possible bring wooden boards, cinder blocks, bricks, old furniture, etc. -anything to help build up the barricades\"\tNEU\n\nRT @MapsCats: Stuff like this trends because a few people made a typo, an algorithm decided to complete \"Bla...\" with Blake, and then people pile onto the hashtag wondering who the fuck Blake is and why he's trending.
