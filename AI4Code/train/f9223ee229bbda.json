In the Product managers category, the respondents are slightly older at 35-39 years(25%).\n  \n      5f. A worrying point to note, while ~300(6%) of this population is Not employed, almost 90% in this segment are under 35 years of age.\n  \n      5g. Research Scientists is the only category that is represented in all age groups, including the 70+ category.\n\n6.

There is a relationship between the questions relating years of using code at work\/school and years using ML methods. However, there are instances were respondets who have, say, <1 year of experience with coding claim to have either 2-3 years or 3-4 years of experience using ML methods.\n13.

In the 'I have never written code' category, interestingly, nearly 20% of the respondents claim to use local tools. I am not sure for what, though.

The average number of ML related activities performed regularly is only 1.\n    \n    16b. Across various ML methods, the most frequently occuring activity performed is: Analyze and understand data.\n    \n    16c. The younger folk, those with less than <5 years of coding experience are made to do the gruelling tasks such as 'Analyze and understand data'; this is observed across the various ML activity types there are. However, the seniors, those with >= 10 years of coding experience perform these activities way less frequently.\n\n17. With respect to using progamming languages regularly, the top 3, based on frequency of responses received are: Python, SQL, and R.\n    \n    17a. On average, the number of languages used regularly is 2.\n    \n    17b. Looking at the pairwise relationship between languages, a combination of Python and SQL received ~1240(26%) of the responses out, whereas Python and R received ~770(16%) of the responses.\n    \n    17c. Python is the number 2 language on Stackoverflow having risen several notches in the last few years.\n\n18. ~2700(57%) of the respondents recommend learning Python as a first language in order to make an entry into Data Science\n    \n    18a. The number of responses from regular users of Python who also recommend using Python is ~2600(54%).\n    \n    18b. However, only 3% of regular users of Python recommend R, and around 2% recommend using SQL.\n    \n    18c. In contrast, 23% of regular users of SQL recommend learning Python, and 13% of users of R recommend learning Python.\n \n19. Based on years coding experience, nearly 80% of the respondents ranging from <1 years to 10-20 years recommend using Python. The exception is the 20+ years group - only 40% recommend learning Python.\n20. Matplotlib (36%), Seaborn (26%) and ggplot2 (12%) are the top 3 visualization tools that are used regularly.\n     \n     20a.

Popular media sources for news on Data Science are: Kaggle forums (23%), Blogs (19%), and YouTube (18%).\n     \n     24a.

Over <strong>80%<\/strong> are under <strong>35 years<\/strong> of age","c466866a":"The analysis of the Indian community in the Kaggle survey 2019 threw up surprises and predictable answers. \nIndian respondents had the highest number of responses(26%). Majority of these respondents are young, over 80% are \nunder 35 years. The survey is dominated by Males (80%). 48% of respondents claim to have a Bachelor's degree and 35% have a Master's\ndegree. However, the percentage of Doctoral degree holders is abysmally low at 4%; this number for a young country like India is very disheartening. Both public and private infrastructure needs to be improved to encourage students to pursue research. This will help stimulate innovation and growth in the economy. \n\nThe top 3 job titles that participated in the survey are Students (32%), Data Scientists (16%) and Software Engineers (15%). 27% of the Master's degree holders fall in the 22-24 years category. In the same category, Software Engieneers and Statisticians have the highest share of responses at 35% each. Doctoral degree holders have the highest share of responses in the 30-34 years at 35%; this indicates that this section applied for Post doctoral research after acquiring some industry experience.\n\nIn the Business Analysts, Data Scientists, Data Engineers, Data Analysts, DBA's, and Research Scientists categories, most of the respondents are in the 25-29 years range. Research Scientists is the only group that has a representation in all age groups, including 70+ years.\n\nAbout 270 respondents under the age of 35 years are Not employed.India needs to capitalize on its young demographic before it withers away.\n\nAbout 65% of the respondents have less than 5 years of experience in coding at work\/school. However, in the 'I have never written code' category, almost 75% of the respondents hold either a Bachelor's or Master's degree. It is imperative to revise the education curriculim to include computing in non-science related fields today as computing helps with automation, data analysis, etc.\n\nThe annual compensation data point was unreliable. But after excluding the missing values and > \\$500K group, and taking the midpoint of the ranges, the mean salary in this population is \\$18K. For Data Scientists, the mean was \\$22K, which is way higher than the average of $14K reported on Glassdoors. The top 3 jobs that will pay you well are: Product\/Project Manager, Data Scientist, and Research Scientist.\n\nAround (28%) of the respondents work for large companies of sizes ranging 1000-9,999 employees to > 10,000 employees. Only large companies can affor to have large workloads of 20+ to execute Data science workloads. Software Engineers play an important part in these companies. Machine learning maturity in this population is very low at 10% - this group has established ML methods at work. Not surprisingly, the ML\/Cloud spend in the last 5 years is close to \\$10K.\n\nAnother point to note was the presence of unaswered questions. According to Kaggle, the younger the respodent, the fewer the questions shown. As the spending\/earning power and experience in this population is on the lower side, relatively speaking, I have ignored about 10 questions, as they are likely to contain a lot of missing values.\n\n59% of the respondents prefer using local environments for programming, and this is popular among all groups with code experience except the 20+ years group, where it is relatively lower. Spreadsheets are popular with those who don't code.\n\nML activities are mostly done by the young workforce, those with less than 5 years of experience in coding. Python is the number 1 language to recommend to anyone interested in a career in Data science. Python is also popular among all groups with code experience except the 20+ years group, where it is relatively lower.\n\nGiven the limited experience, Scikit-learn is popular among the respondents, and simple algorithms like Linear and logistic Regression, Decision Tree are popular; these are used to build prototypes, and gain insight.\n\nHosted notebooks are popular with the young workforce, and these people spend time on Kaggle forums, blogs to learn and grow. Online learning platforms such as Coursera, Udemy, and YouTube are popular for learning new courses.\n\nWhile there are countries in this survey that have an established presence in Data Science\/Machine learning, their population is rapidly aging; the young Indian community should be able to pick up the baton, so to speak. For this to happen, they need to be have the relevant skillsets. There is no shortage, today, of courses and data available online. We have to take advantage of these resources such as Kaggle, etc to improve our skills; this will not only make us self-reliant, but find also help us find innovative solutions to pressing problems in agriculture, education, and healthcare.\n","5f467873":"Observation:\n\nFrom left to right and from top to bottom, in order\n\n1. <strong>2600(54%)<\/strong> of the responses from regular users of <strong>Python<\/strong> also recommend using <strong>Python<\/strong>\n2. <strong>163(3%)<\/strong> of the responses from regular users of <strong>Python<\/strong> also recommend using <strong>R<\/strong>\n3. <strong>100(2%)<\/strong> of the responses from regular users of <strong>Python<\/strong> also recommend using <strong>SQL<\/strong>\n4. <strong>613(13%)<\/strong> of the responses from regular users of <strong>R<\/strong> also recommend using <strong>Python<\/strong>\n5. <strong>1082(23%)<\/strong> responses from regular users of <strong>SQL<\/strong> also recommend using <strong>Python<\/strong>\n6. <strong>50(1%)<\/strong> of the responses from regular users of <strong>R<\/strong> also recommend using <strong>SQL<\/strong>\n7. <strong>97(2%)<\/strong> of the responses from regular users of <strong>SQL<\/strong> also recommend using <strong>R<\/strong>","7695dd0e":"Observation:\n\nIndia stands at the top, among all survey takers for 2019; this number is (4786) 24%. \n\nIndia has one of the youngest workforces in the world.
