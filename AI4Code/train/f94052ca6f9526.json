Drive-Through Screening Center\nAs the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is ongoing, the number of individuals to be tested for COVID-19 is rapidly increasing. For safe and efficient screening for COVID-19, drive-through (DT) screening centers have been designed and implemented in Korea. Herein, we present the overall concept, advantages, and limitations of the COVID-19 DT screening centers. The steps of the DT centers include registration, examination, specimen collection, and instructions. The entire service takes about 10 minutes for one testee without leaving his or her cars. Increased testing capacity over 100 tests per day and prevention of cross-infection between testees in the waiting space are the major advantages, while protection of staff from the outdoor atmosphere is challenging. It could be implemented in other countries to cope with the global COVID-19 outbreak and transformed according to their own situations.\n\nSource: [Drive-Through Screening Center for COVID-19: a Safe and Efficient Screening System against Massive Community Outbreak](https:\/\/jkms.org\/DOIx.php?id=10.3346\/jkms.2020.35.e123)\n\n![DT](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/50820635\/78366270-38e51600-75fb-11ea-98fa-f306c9a40a35.PNG)  \n\n","f4fa2723":"# 1.

Unique but Universally-applicable\nKorea uses IT technology and drvie-through testing sites to minimize contact. Mobile apps track the condition and movement of infected individuals.\n### 4. Strict Control\nKorea prohibits individuals who have been in contact with confirmed cases from exiting Korea during the 14-day self-quarantine period.\n### 5.
