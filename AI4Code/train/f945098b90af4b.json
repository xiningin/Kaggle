Agreed! Whatsapp! \n* SOCIAL category has the second highest install rates.

This is a bitter remiender of the very unhealthy lifestyle that we have decended into. I personally believe that we need to be much more concerned about out fitness. I will look into this issue more as I proceed with the analysis.\n* It is great to know NEWS_AND_MAGAZINES apps have a substantial number of installs\n* PHOTOGRAPHY\/TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL apps have a greater number of installs that SHOPPING. Looks wierd to me as almost everthing now sells online and almost every person that I have met has Amazon installed in their phones. But on the other side int can be that the number of good PHOTOGRAPHY apps are flatout more than the number of good SHOPPING apps. We will see.\n* GAME is almost equal to PHOTOGRAPHY.
