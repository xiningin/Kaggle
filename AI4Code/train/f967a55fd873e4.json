There was quite a few things to be done and in the interest of time i ignored some of the important things that were needed to make the code function. The easiest part was probably coming up with the code. When I looked at the project I already could understand how an interaction between a customer and employee could go. I just used my current knowledge of the python language to allow that conversation between a computer and a user.|peer feedback|. My plan was basically my final project with a little less stuff I belive. I did some more things in my final project. My idea was probably too easy because i knew what to do for most of it and the errors I had were with my typing. It was also \"difficult\" because I did not want to do a bunch of typing for everything. If I had unlimited time I would probably allow them to get combinations of items and extra things for all items. I would also probably expand the menu a little bit to give them some more options.","22d60e5f":"# Reflection","05f4e88d":"## Project Instructions\nWrite a program that will display a final receipt for a customer order at Yum Yum Burger Joint. The customer can enter 3 amounts for 3 of the following menu items they select:\n\nFirst, show the user the menu: \n```\nYum Yum Burger            $0.99\nGrease Yum Fries          $0.79\nSoda Yum                  $1.09\n```\nThe program will keep track of how many they order of each item and the total price for each item and the total order price.\n\nYou will ask the user whether they would like to order more, which they would like to order, and how many.
