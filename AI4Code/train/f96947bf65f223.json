When the gradient becomes too small, the parameter updates become insignificant. [1]\n\nAlso there is the problem of exploding gradient. This problem arises when large error gradients accumulate, resulting in very large updates to the neural network model weights during the training process. [1]\n\ntanh (or sigmoid) activation function maps all values into a range between -1 and 1, and the derivative is bounded by 1 (1\/4 in the case of sigmoid) and tanh functions have derivatives of 0 at both ends. [2]\n\nThe gradient values are shrinking exponentially fast, eventually vanishing completely after a few time steps. Gradient contributions from \u201cfar away\u201d steps become zero, and the state at those steps doesn\u2019t contribute to what you are learning: You end up not learning long-range dependencies. Vanishing gradients aren\u2019t exclusive to RNNs. They also happen in deep Feedforward Neural Networks. It\u2019s just that RNNs tend to be very deep (as deep as the sentence length in our case), which makes the problem a lot more common. [2]\n\nFortunately, there are a few ways to combat the vanishing gradient problem. Proper initialization of the W matrix can reduce the effect of vanishing gradients. So can regularization. A more preferred solution is to use ReLU instead of tanh or sigmoid activation functions. The ReLU derivative is a constant of either 0 or 1, so it isn\u2019t as likely to suffer from vanishing gradients. [2]\n\nAnd even more popular solution is to use Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) or Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) architectures. Both of these RNN architectures were explicitly designed to deal with vanishing gradients and efficiently learn long-range dependencies. [2]","fd7df5be":"Please don't forget to upvote this notebook.

For this reason, the first layer in a Sequential model (and only the first, because following layers can do automatic shape inference) needs to receive information about its input shape.

This is a shape tuple (a tuple of integers or None entries, where None indicates that any positive integer may be expected). In input_shape, the batch dimension is not included.\n\n* pass instead a batch_input_shape argument, where the batch dimension is included.
