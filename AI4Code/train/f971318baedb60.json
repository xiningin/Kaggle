ASK\n\n##### About Bellabeat\n\nBellabeat is a successful small high-tech company that manufactures health-focused smart products. Collecting data on activity, sleep, stress and reproductive health has allowed Bellabeat to empower women with knowledge about their own health and habits. Since it was founded in 2013, Bellabeat has grown rapidly and quickly positioned itself as a tech-driven wellness company for women.\n\n##### Primary stakeholders:\n\nUrska Srsen - Bellabeat's cofounder and Chief Creative Officer\n\nSando Mur - Mathematician and Bellabeat's cofounder\n\n##### Secondary stakeholders:\n\nBellabeat marketing analytics team - A team of data analysts responsible for collecting, analyzing and reporting data that helps guide Bellabeat's marketing strategy.\n\n##### Business task:\n\nAnalyze smart devise usage data in order to gain insight into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices. Select one product to apply these insights to:\n\n1. What are some trends in smart device usage?\n2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?\n3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?\n\n#### 2.

This could vary depending on the different jobs, schedules, lifestyles they have. Also, it slowly picks up again on Friday which could be motivated by activities etc.\n\n#### 5. SHARE\n\nWhat are some of high level trends?\n1. Participants used their fitness trackers for daily activity the most.\n2. Participants are less active towards the end of the work week.\n3. Participants spend over half of the day inactive.\n\n#### 6. ACT\n\nHow could these trends help?\n\n1. Auto capturing feature for sleep trackers\nA further investigation into why participants dont log their sleep activity. Adding reminders to go log their sleep and capturing it automatically would make things easier. Also, maybe promote a healthy mindulfness sleep routine to entice users.\n\n2. Promote regular excercise\nTowards the end of the week, people become more inactive. Adding short reminders or workout videos to Bellabeat's app could inspire users to stay active during the week.\n\n3. Just do it!\nToo much time is spent inactive. Adding regular reminders of all sorts during the active hours of the day could significantly trigger changes.Make use of the smart devices that in close contact with the skin, maybe introduce light vibrations as regular reminders.\n\nThank you,\n\nMariam Sengo","1a476a9d":"#### 4.
