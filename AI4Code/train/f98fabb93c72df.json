The threshold values range from 0.5 to 0.75 with a step size of 0.05. In other words, at a threshold of 0.5, a predicted object is considered a \"hit\" if its intersection over union with a ground truth object is greater than 0.5.\n\nAt each threshold value t\n, a precision value is calculated based on the number of true positives (TP), false negatives (FN), and false positives (FP) resulting from comparing the predicted object to all ground truth objects:\nTP(t)\/TP(t)+FP(t)+FN(t)\n\nThe average precision of a single image is calculated as the mean of the above precision values at each IoU threshold:\n$$ \\frac{1}{|thresholds|} \\sum_t \\frac{TP(t)}{TP(t) + FP(t) + FN(t)}.$$\n\nLastly, the score returned by the competition metric is the mean taken over the individual average precisions of each image in the test dataset.","0d9aaff8":"# Looking at the images","d4b44502":"# Introduction\n\nIn this competition, you\u2019ll detect wheat heads from outdoor images of wheat plants, including wheat datasets from around the globe. If successful, researchers can accurately estimate the density and size of wheat heads in different varieties. With improved detection farmers can better assess their crops, ultimately bringing cereal, toast, and other favorite dishes to your table.\n\nTo get large and accurate data about wheat fields worldwide, plant scientists use image detection of \"wheat heads\"\u2014spikes atop the plant containing grain. These images are used to estimate the density and size of wheat heads in different varieties. \n\nModels developed for wheat phenotyping need to generalize between different growing environments. Current detection methods involve one- and two-stage detectors (Yolo-V3 and Faster-RCNN), but even when trained with a large dataset, a bias to the training region remains.\n\n![https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/kaggle-media\/competitions\/UofS-Wheat\/descriptionimage.png](https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/kaggle-media\/competitions\/UofS-Wheat\/descriptionimage.png)\n\n\n***N.B.
