Probably generated every half an hour for 24 hours (Jane Street operates around the clock with trading offices at different locations around the globe)\n\nLet us look at the features between 72 and 119. ","7db9f8c4":"Looking at the heatmap for features between feature_72 to feature_119, we see some interesting observations\n- tag_0 to tag_5 can either be day of week Monday-Friday and a weekend or it can be 6 days because trading is done 24 hours around the globe.\n- tag_23 is common in all these features and not used in generating any other features. So, it can be a tag saying it is a time based feature\n- tag_15 and tag_17 are complementary to each other, i.e., if one of these tags is used to generate a feature, then the other one is not used. It probably can be market opening and closing indicators across different time zones.\n- tag_24, tag_25, tag_26, tag_27 can be market data across their different locations (New York, London, Hong Kong, and Amsterdam)","c2a715a8":"## Features and tags\n\nAs [mentioned here](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/jane-street-market-prediction\/discussion\/198965#1088878), tags shows the realtionship between anonymized features. For example, for feature_1, tag_6 and tag_7 are true which means these two tags were used to generate feature_1. "}}
