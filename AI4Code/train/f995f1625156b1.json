At the southern edge of this rise are the craters Aristarchus and Herodotus. \n    \nThe origins of this rille are believed to be volcanic. The interior floor has been resurfaced and is very level.

The feature is bright enough to be visible to the naked eye, and displays unusually bright features when viewed through a large telescope.

The crater is deeper than the Grand Canyon.\n    \n    \nThe crater is located at the southeastern edge of the Aristarchus plateau, an elevated area that contains a number of volcanic features, such as sinuous rilles.

He taught medical students before becoming a professor of astronomy at the University of Munich in 1826. \n    \nLike others before and since his time, Gruithuisen believed that the Earth's moon was habitable. He made multiple observations of the lunar surface that supported his beliefs, including his announcement of the discovery of a city in the rough terrain to the north of Schr\u00f6ter crater he named the Wallwerk. This region contains a series of somewhat linear ridges that have a fishbone-like pattern, and, with the small refracting telescope he was using, could be perceived as resembling buildings complete with streets. He published his observations in 1824, but they were greeted with much skepticism by other astronomers of the time. His claims were readily refuted using more powerful instruments.\n\nHe is also noted for the discovery of bright caps on the cusps of the crescent Venus, and for being the first to suggest that craters on the Moon were caused by meteorite impacts. He proposed that jungles on Venus grew more rapidly than in Brazil due to the proximity of the planet to the Sun, and that as a consequence the inhabitants celebrated fire festivals\u2014 the cause of the bright caps on Venus. \n    \n<\/div>","a1162e62":"Most of the anamolies that are observed have been about the presence of some sort of bright spot or a spot that has some different color visible like blue or violet.\n\nThere also have been a quite a few anamoly descriptions with mentions of Volcanic Activities, lets try to look at them aswell","08c15c82":"# Exploration Across Location","4e6060bc":"# The Dark Side \n\nThe phrase \"dark side of the Moon\" does not refer to \"dark\" as in the absence of light, but rather \"dark\" as in unknown: until humans were able to send spacecraft around the Moon, this area had never been seen.
