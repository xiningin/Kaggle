Math Score has a positive linear relationship with gender as female gender (0 in encoding) tend to score less in maths than male gender (1 in encoding). For reading and writing is the other way around, female gender tend to have better scores. This effect is clearer in writing score, where female gender has clearly a higher median and 25 and 75 quantiles' values.","6b982c28":"This approach consists in converting each value in a column to a number: in column *Lunch* 'standard' will be represented by a 1 and 'free\/reduced' by a 0.","c4a24c1c":"This is a [Kaggle task inspired notebook](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/spscientist\/students-performance-in-exams\/tasks?taskId=280).\n\nMain objective is to figure out if a correlation exists between the different attributes that are in the dataset.

For example, attending to math scoring we could say that there's almost no variation among groups A, B and C, and same pattern is reflected in writing score.
