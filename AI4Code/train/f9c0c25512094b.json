Ship\nTitanic was a British passenger liner operated by the White Star Line that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean in the early morning hours of 15 April 1912, after striking an iceberg during her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. Of the estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard, more than 1,500 died, making the sinking one of modern history's deadliest peacetime commercial marine disasters.\nThough there were about 2,224 passengers and crew members, we are given data of about 1,300 passengers. Out of these 1,300 passengers details, about 9000 data is used for training purpose and remaining 400 is used for test purpose. In this competition we are given about 400 test data with missing survived column and we have to use different machine learning algorithms to predict whether the passengers in the test data survived or not.\nBoth training and test data arenot clean(contains lots of missing values), so main goal of this competition is to clean the data and build the model with best accuracy.","de340503":"## Converting a categorical feature\u00b6\n\n","0e85569f":"# Dealing with the Missing values","280e91aa":"#### Any suggestions to improve score are most welcome.\n\n# Thank you ","b297f252":"## Importing all necessary libraries\n","0b545d4b":"# preparing training and testing data","fb3a64c9":"**Survival rate on the basis of Pclass**","3066899f":"#  Ensemble Learning\nEnsemble learning is the process by which multiple models, such as classifiers or experts, are strategically generated and combined to solve a particular computational intelligence problem","ce4f9c76":"# Creating new feature Title extracting from existing feature Name\n","a2ebc52f":"##### Let's  start by converting Sex feature to categorical  female=1 and male=0","9deab9dd":"## Creating model","bc4be2ed":"\n#### We can see that total number of columns in test data is one less than that in train data.
