You can get a result from the slot machine by calling `play_slot_machine()`. The number it returns is your winnings in dollars. Usually it returns 0.  But sometimes you'll get lucky and get a big payday. Try running it below:","e9f70a8f":"These exercises accompany the tutorial on [loops and list comprehensions](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/ephemerai\/python-loops-and-list-comprehensions).\n\nAs always, run the setup code below before working on the questions (and if you leave this notebook and come back later, remember to run the setup code again).","f2d814d3":"## 5. <span title=\"Spicy\" style=\"color: coral\">\ud83c\udf36\ufe0f\ud83c\udf36\ufe0f<\/span>\n\nGary wants to know how many spins he can play before running out of money. (Remember, each turn at the slot machine costs $1.)\n\nSo, if he has $10, he can definitely play 10 spins (because he'll have enough money to pay for the 10th spin even if he never wins). But he could only play an 11th spin if his total winnings from the first 10 was enough to pay for the 11th spin. How likely is that?\n\nYou will estimate the probability with the Monte Carlo method. That is, you will simulate the scenario many times, and return the proportion of simulations where he ran out of money before a desired number of spins. \n\nComplete the function below to estimate the probability that he can complete a given number of spins of the machine before running out of money.","a1af2f9d":"When you think you know the expected value per spin, uncomment the line below to see how close you were.","c0a3ca1e":"# Exercises","38f9e253":"**My solution is wrong because I simply calculated the total amount earned\/lost during n spins.

Don't worry, we'll send you the bill later.\n\nOn average, how much money can you expect to gain (or lose) every time you play the machine?  The casino keeps it a secret, but you can estimate the average value of each pull using a technique called the **Monte Carlo method**. To estimate the average outcome, we simulate the scenario many times, and return the average result.\n\nComplete the following function to calculate the average value per play of the slot machine.","60ba9f29":"If you have any questions, be sure to post them on the [forums](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/learn-forum).\n\nRemember that your notebook is private by default, and in order to share it with other people or ask for help with it, you'll need to make it public. First, you'll need to save a version of your notebook that shows your current work by hitting the \"Commit & Run\" button. (Your work is saved automatically, but versioning your work lets you go back and look at what it was like at the point you saved it. It also let's you share a nice compiled notebook instead of just the raw code.) Then, once your notebook is finished running, you can go to the Settings tab in the panel to the left (you may have to expand it by hitting the [<] button next to the \"Commit & Run\" button) and setting the \"Visibility\" dropdown to \"Public\".\n\n# Keep Going\n\nWhen you're ready to continue, [click here](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/ephemerai\/python-strings-and-dictionaries) to continue on to the next tutorial on strings and dictionaries."}}
