It is not mandatory but always a upperhand to know and understand the math behind sounds. A general understanding is cool too. This video, [What's Noise](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=i_0DXxNeaQ0) will help you understand a bit about sound, if not all.\n\nAn audio signal is represented in the form of an audio signal having parameters such as frequency, bandwidth, decibel etc. A typical audio signal can be expressed as a function of Amplitude and Time. The audio signal is a three-dimensional signal in which three axes represent time, amplitude and frequency.\n\n![Imgur](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/5c82I1B.jpg)","b47fe5f8":"<a id=\"sel\"><\/a>\n## Selecting a Species\n\n**From the dataset, we can focus on a certain bird species and analyze the sound\/call of that particular bird.

Birds play an essential role in nature. They are high up in the food chain and integrate changes occurring at lower levels. As such, birds are excellent indicators of deteriorating habitat quality and environmental pollution. However, it is often easier to hear birds than see them. With proper sound detection and classification, researchers could automatically intuit factors about an area\u2019s quality of life based on a changing bird population.\n\nIn this Kaggle competition, **The Cornell Lab of Ornithology\u2019s Center for Conservation Bioacoustics**(CCB) provided a wide variety of bird vocalizations in soundscape recordings. Indepth and efficient analysis and inference on this can help the researchers to make better steps towards nature conservation.\n\nThis is a wide area and it requires strong technical knowledge to give out a useful result. The first and foremost task towards this goal is analyzing the audio given to us and deduce some information from those.\n\nWorking with audios are not a common task a typical Data science enthusiast goes through. **This notebook will help you with some basic ideas and concepts to start out with audio processing. So let's dive in...**","3652217a":"<a id=\"zcr\"><\/a>\n## 2.
