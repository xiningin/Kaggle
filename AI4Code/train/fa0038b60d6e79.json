Dataset contains adequate, clean and structured information, however, each country has missing values in few years .\n\n2. 101 country and 6 generations participated in the dataset with GDP per capita from 251 to 126352 dolars.\n\n3. Numerical data has strong right skew, what means, that majority of values locates at left side of X axe and should it be grouped more deeply to archieve normal distribution.\n\n4. Countries with the biggest suicide rate are Russia, USA, Japan, France, Ukraine.\n\n5. In their majority, suicider's age is between 35 and 54 years and they represents 'Silent Generation' and 'X Generation'.\n\n6. The suicides rate was increasing during each global crysis, at 90's among 'Silent Generation' and at 08's among 'X Generation'.\n\n7. Male side is 5 times mores likely to commit a suicide comparing to females.\n\n8. Among Baltic states, Lithuania's suicide rates are 2 times bigger than Latvia's or Estonia's rates.\n\n9. USA takes second place on total suicides amount not because of high suicide rate, but due to relatively big population.\n\n10. The higher is GDP per capita, the less suicides happens in country.\n\n11.

It shows, that Ukrainians ar more endurant and stress-resistant.\n* Besides the fact, that USA takes second place by overall suicide number, the suicide rate on 100k population is stable and low.
