GDP per capita is highly correlated with phones, services ,literacy rate(positively correlated) and infant mortality rate, agriculture ,birthrate (negatively correlated).\n3. On being grouped region wise, GDP per capita is positively correlated with phones and services. As in the region where people tend to buy more phones those regions tend to have more GDP per capita and as for services , more the services more is the GDP per capita.\n4. For highly correlated factors , the density distribution is mostly skewed. \n5. Climate has no effect on GDP per capita.\n6. For multiple linear regression, we found the RMSE and MSLE values for test data, and RMSE value is low in the range (55000) is a good measure and hence tells us that model is a good predictor as in we can make theoritical claims and also the vakue for MSLE is low so our model is also a good estimator.(lower value of MSE shows that whether our model is a good estimator. (As in test data fits well with line of regression or not).\n7. For single linear regression (phones per 1000 vs GDP per capita), we see that both RMSE and MSE values are good measure. Phones per 1000 is a good factor that can predict GDP per capita values.\n8. According to total GDP countries like India and China which have low GDP per capita (Rank 146 and Rank 118 respectively) jump to positions 4 and 2 respectively. This shows that although GDP per capita per country is low they have high purchasing power(total GDP).\n9. Countries with high total GDP is quite different from countries with high GDP per capita.\n10. Total GDP is highly correlated with Area and Population.\n11. Factors which were highly correlated with GDP per capita has almost no effect on total GDP except for Phones per 1000 , which has correlation of 0.23.\n","46c78b1b":"We are checking whether are dataset has any missing values .

In a pair plot we can see the distribution for both of the single variables and relationships between two variables(Here GDP per capita, Phones per (1000) and Service).

The main focus of this project is GDP (Gross Domestic Product), factors that affects GDP per capita and on the basis of the effects trying to create a model , which uses the data of 227 countries from the given dataset. Also in the following project there is a brief explanation of how total GDPs is related with all the factors. The key methods used for analysis of data is Correlation and Linear Regression. Our key findings leads us to know that GDP per capita is highly correlated with the factors such Literacy, Phones, Service, Infant mortality, Birthrate and Agriculture. \nThis project is a good practice for EDA and visualization. \nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the first step in your data analysis process.we take a broad look at patterns, trends, outliers, unexpected results and so on in the dataset, using visual and quantitative methods to get a sense of the story it tells. ","3784cc5d":"Since we know from above given Dataset , that two of the columns i.e Region and Climate have non-numeric values , so before we proceed forward we need to convert it into numeric values , so that we can run different machine learning algorithms on it .

Label encoding  simply converts each value of a column to a number.","abcca254":"### Missing values being filled in columns","42a64644":"### Statistcal analysis of given dataset","895f2ddc":"#### Calculated Value for RMSE AND MSE  [Reference](#1)","25d55939":"### By looking at the heatmap for a given dataset we can say that following factors are positively correlated with GDP per capita:-\n\n### r>0 for:-\n1.
