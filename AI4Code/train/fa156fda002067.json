The dataset shows the Latest Covid-19 Statewise Data in India. With the data, a few plots have been derived.\n\n* The Statewise total cases shows the total number of recorded Covid cases each state. From the plot, we can infer that Maharashtra has the highest number of recorded cases followed by Kerala and Karnataka.\n* The Statewise Deaths shows the total number of deaths each state. Maharashtra has the highest death rate at 138546 deaths, after which Karnataka has the death rate at 37627. Tamil Nadu has a death rate of 35360 which stands third.\n* The dataset also shows that as Total Cases increase, the deaths also keep increasing.\n* The scatter plot shows the discharge ratio to the death ratio state wise.\n","ef382f37":"Plot showing the statewise Covid cases.","ac64ed3c":"Regression plot showing Total Cases and Deaths.
