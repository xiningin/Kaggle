I wonder who that person is :)","5444721d":"There are several interesting things about popular programming languages in Russia:\n- Python and SQL are, of course, top used languages;\n- R isn't popular. In USA software for statistics was developed gradually, R appeared a long ago and is currently widely used. In USSR R wasn't used, so it wasn't able to become popular. Also there are not as many clinical trials in Russia, so there is no such demand for R;\n- a lot of kagglers have background in software programming, as a result a lot of porple know C++, Bash and other languages;","b5dedd53":"In our job using correct ML tools could be crucial to the success. I'd like to point out that automated data augmentation is commonly used. [Albumentations](https:\/\/github.com\/albu\/albumentations) is a library developed by the members of ods.ai community and is currently used in all image competitions.\n\nAnd even more people wrote that they use Catalyst here :)","83cf304c":"I think it is quite amazing that a lot of people do some kind or research or try innovative things. A lot of people do research or try to apply new methods, some other people build technologically sound solutions.","082d66e7":"Not only age progresses, but also the degree of education, We can see that more and more people get masters and doctor degrees and provide a valueable expertise.","37fd9010":"Not surprisingly, the average age is increasing over time. One of the reasons is that people grow older over time (obviously :)). Another reason - more elder experts are switching career from other spheres to DS.\n\nIt is interesting to notice that most of women are younger than men. I suppose it means that more women go into DS after university which is great!","4f4b2d98":"## General information\n\nRussian community on Kaggle is quite strong. We started taking part in Kaggle competitions long ago and most competitions have at least several teams in medal zone, currently there are a lot of russian Grandmasters. It is worth noticing, that most of them are a part ods.ai - an open DS community, which has more than 38k users.\n\nIf we look at other countries, we can see that the number of respondents in Russia is in the 5th place in the overall ranking (excluding \"other\").\n\nMore than 600 Russians took part in the survey this year. Why this number is lower than the last year? I think this year the information of the survey was less spread, not sure why.","f6adec8e":"Not surprisingly word embeddings continue to be popular. They often don't require GPU at all or can be used in small neural nets (not requiring huge resources). On the other hand BERT and other transformers allow to get great results rather easily, provided of course you have enough resources.","fe18975c":"But such questions also provide a lot of interesting information if we have a look at free form questions!\nThere are a lot of people using [Catboost](https:\/\/github.com\/catboost\/catboost). It wasn't able to get in the list of the main libraries, but maybe next year it will change :)\n\nAnd there are 4 people using [Catalyst](https:\/\/github.com\/catalyst-team\/catalyst) - a higher level framework build on the top of Pytorch.\nBoth of these libraries are developed in Russia.","da64d72d":"While scikit-learn is a top popular library for obvious reasons, there are other interesting libraries.\n- LGB and XGB are very popular as they provide great results and are easy to use.\n- Pytorch was able to reach Keras by the number of users and is ahead of Tensorflow. I think in future Pytorch will be even more popular as it is often more convenient than Tensoflow;","48019253":"## Ods.ai ranking\n\nThere is no way of course to match survey with kaggle accounts. And in meta-kaggle dataset there is no information about kagglers' country. But we can see people by organizations and there is organization for ods.ai. Let's see the ranking of people in ods.ai!\n\n- There are 14 Grandmasters, and 13 of them are Competition grandmasters!\n- There are also 44 Masters and 43 of them are Competition masters!\n- I suppose, the one Grandmaster in discussions and scripts is me...","7243ac4b":"## Professional skills\n\nIt isn't surprising that Kaggle is one of the main sources of getting information :)\nBut is is worth noticing that slack communities aren't far behind. And of course, the most popular of them is ods.ai."}}
