Early on, many of the patients in the outbreak in Wuhan, China reportedly had some link to a large seafood and animal market, suggesting animal-to-person spread. However, a growing number of patients reportedly have not had exposure to animal markets, indicating person-to-person spread is occurring. At this time, it\u2019s unclear how easily or sustainably this virus is spreading between people - CDC\n\nThis dataset has daily level information on the number of affected cases, deaths and recovery from 2019 novel coronavirus.
