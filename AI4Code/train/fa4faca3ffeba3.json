For example, at some airports, you can pass through customs by letting a system scan your passport and then verifying that you (the person carrying the passport) are the correct person. A mobile phone that unlocks using your face is also using face verification. This is a 1:1 matching problem. \n- **Face Recognition** - \"who is this person?\". For example, the video lecture showed a [face recognition video](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=wr4rx0Spihs) of Baidu employees entering the office without needing to otherwise identify themselves. This is a 1:K matching problem. \n\nFaceNet learns a neural network that encodes a face image into a vector of 128 numbers. By comparing two such vectors, you can then determine if two pictures are of the same person.\n    \n**Goal of this Notebook :**\n- Implement the triplet loss function\n- Use a pretrained model to map face images into 128-dimensional encodings\n- Use these encodings to perform face verification and face recognition\n\n#### Channels-first notation\n\n* We will  be using a pre-trained model which represents ConvNet activations\n* In other words, a batch of images will be of shape $(m, n_C, n_H, n_W)$ , m= batch of m images , n_C= number of channels in the image , n_W = Horizontal axis\/Width of the Image ,n_H= Vertical Axis\/height of the Image\n\n* Both of these conventions have a reasonable amount of traction among open-source implementations; there isn't a uniform standard yet within the deep learning community.
