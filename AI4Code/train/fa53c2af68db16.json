There are 891 examples, therefore all the features and the target are given in 891 points.

For ```Pclass```, mean (*2.308642*) is lower than the median (*3.0000*). This shows that the classes of the passenger was skewed more towards 3rd class, as most people were on the 3rd class.\n2.  For ```Fare```, mean (*32.204208*) is higher than the median (*14.454200*).

For ```Age```, the mean (*29.699118*) is almost equal to the median (*28.000000*). This shows that the data is almost evely distributed on the right and left side of the median\n4. For ```SibSp```, the mean is (*0.523008*) is higher than the median(*0.0000*). The skew is to the left as many passengers were travelling without a spouse or sibling. Almost the same observation can be made for ```Parch``` as many passengers did not have a parent or child onboard.\n5. For ```Survived```, mean (*0.383838*) is higher than the median (*0.0000*). This is because many passengers died, thus skew was to the left.","e4ba7c5b":"Genarally, the upper the class the passenger was in, the higher the likelihood of survival. For this dataset, more people survived than those who died in the first class. For second and third classes, more died than those who survived but the ratio of survivors to total passengers in second class was higher than that in third class.
