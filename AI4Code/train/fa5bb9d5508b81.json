In this competition, we are directly predicting the genetic status from MRI images, which could limit the amount of surgeries required and also lead to accelerated treatment and better selection of chemotherapeutics. It will lead to better management of patients with brain cancer.\n\nThere is a paper [here](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2107.02314) with more details about this competition.\n\nI'll provide a quick and simple EDA to help you get started with this very interesting competition!","96d263ac":"# Dataset organization and MRI images\n\nThis competition dataset provides four types of MRI images:\n\n1.
