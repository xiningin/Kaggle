In CTDS we observed 3 significant peaks, one after Jeremy Howard's episode, one after Parul Pandey's episode and the other Abishek Thakur's episode, which were 3 most viewed episodes in CTDS show.

Audience seem to love hearing more from the heroes.\n* Youtube non-impression views are more than impressions (almost 2x), looks like CTDS has got good network and reputation in a circle that has driven non-impression views. To reach masses or bigger crowd, organic growth is important.\n* Sulemani, Masala and Ginger flavour chai seem to be positively impacting host's interaction with the heroes in the podcasts.\n* Podcasts looks to be better presented as audio episodes than audio\/video (youtube), which is evident from apple\/spotify stats vs youtube stats. Former had solid viewership with reference to watch duration though viewership count was less.\n* Better suited podcast mediums - spotify and apple - either marketing\/word of mouth will help in getting the audience. Once we get audience they seem to be listening to the episodes more than through youtube.\n* Overall the contribution of CTDS is immense to Machine Learning\/Data Science community. Sanyam's release of podcasts is consistent over the year, which shows his dedication. The fact that well respected heroes are willing to give interview to CTDS channel express the reputation Sanyam has in the AI community.\n\n\n# Naming few ingredients that seems to be working well\n\n* Including AMA section in all the episodes as possible <br>\n* Concentrating more on episodes that immediately follow most viewed podcasts <br>\n* Requesting more female heroes to be part of the podcasts as they garnered more youtube views than male heroes <br>\n* Giving more space and time to heroes as needed - top viewed episodes suffice this fact <br>\n* Drinking Sulemani chai in the morning & night recording session and Ginger Chai in the evening recording sessions seem to have positive effect on podcasts <br>\n\nAll the above are just my humble opinion based on the data and inference.
