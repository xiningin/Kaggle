Teams always gain Elo points for winning. But they get more credit for upset victories and for winning by larger margins. Elo ratings are zero-sum, however.

The teams that are worth the most, tend to be the ones that have the biggest audiences. Which makes sense from a business perspective. What doesn't make so much sense is why a team that doesn't do well, that plays poorly, gets so many people, despite its performance.\n\n#### Why does this happen? Why do people go to see bad teams?\n#### Possible reasons:\n##### 1. A tourist issue. Being historical teams, tourists don't care about the result, but about the show and the fact of visiting to those stadiums.\n","5469fd77":"### Most teams values are between 750 and 1500 millions.

There are teams that, having played for many more years, will have a higher or lower ELO score (depending on their performance), but with a higher sample size than younger teams.\n\n##### Two of the highest rating teams are in the worst ELO.

The best way to predict the value of a team, is by looking at the total attendance the team brings. Although not all teams that attract people have a high valuation, for the team to be valuable, it needs to have a high audience.\n\n### Audience, the audience, for its part, does not depend on the performance of the team. There are very good teams that bring the same or fewer people to their stadium than there are teams that play badly.\n\n### What can be seen is that the audience is something that depends on the city. and among the variables of the cities, which affect the atendence, are tourism and the number of people who live in the state, they affect this variable. As you can see in this link (https:\/\/www.infoplease.com\/us\/states\/state-population-by-rank), the four largest states coincide with the location of the most valuable teams: New york, Miami, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, Texas. The only exception to this rule is the Boston Celtics, who don't have a large crowd but are in the top 10 of the most valuable teams.\n\n### Attendance, which is derived from the location, is the most important variable when evaluating a basketball team.\n\n\n","eeaee3b8":"## Team valuations (2017)\n\n\n### What makes a team valuable?\n#### Possible answers to check:\n##### 1.
