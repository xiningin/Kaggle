Repeat this for `fruity`.

For example, a pinot noir produced in the US should map to `\"US - Pinot Noir\"`. The values should be counts of how many times the given wine appears in the dataset. Drop any reviews with incomplete `country` or `variety` data.\n\nHint: you can do this in three steps. First, generate a `DataFrame` whose `country` and `variety` columns are non-null. Then use a map to create a series whose entries are a `str` concatenation of those two columns. Finally, generate a `Series` counting how many times each label appears in the dataset.","27013228":"**Exercise 5**: I\"m an economical wine buyer.

Plucking the right data out of our data representation is critical to getting work done.\n\nHowever, the data does not always come in the format we want. Sometimes we have to do some more work ourselves to reformat it for our desired task.\n\nThe remainder of this tutorial will cover different operations we can apply to our data to get the input \"just right\". We'll start off in this section by looking at the most commonly looked built-in reshaping operations. Along the way we'll cover data `dtypes`, a concept essential to working with `pandas` effectively.","59db3525":"# Checking Answers\n\n**Check your answers in each exercise using the  `check_qN` function** (replacing `N` with the number of the exercise).
