But extraversion is inherently immeasurable (how could you measure it exactly?), so instead the measurement is done on the concrete\/visible behaviors that indicate extraversion:\n\n- Do they like to talk at parties?\n- Do they prefer being alone?\n- Do they favor activities that involve a lot of people?\n- and so on.\n\nEach question contributes to determining their level of extraversion. One can also say that extraversion is a **common factor** that describes how people will answer such questions.\n\nThat is exactly what factor analysis is. Finding a hidden **common factor** (extraversion) from a set of **measured variables** (91 answers regarding behavior).","e0d3a8cf":"# Performing factor analysis\n\nThe dataset is about testing extrovert-introvert. Naturally, there is only one factor worth considering for the 91 variables.","ae356ee5":"# Remarks and closing\n\nWe have extracted extraversion score from the 91 answers. I hope you learn something and have fun!\n\nKeep learning and happy data-sciencing!","0865b053":"# Distribution of people's extraversion\n\nI have shown that common factor F1 is indeed extraversion. To simplify, I will call F1 \"extraversion value\". The higher the value, the more likely a person is to be an extrovert.\n\nThe next big question is then: how is people's extraversion distributed? Can we neatly separate people into introverts and extroverts?","abc3cd5d":"We can see that every question is correlated positively with a certain group of questions and correlated negatively with another certain group of questions.\n\nLater on, we will see that these two groups are agree-extrovert and agree-introvert questions.","f2c71144":"# Introduction\n\nIn this notebook, we will attempt to separate people into extroverts and introverts. Or at least find a way to do so.\n\n*How we're going to do that?*\n\nI am going to use **Factor Analysis** -- the less-known cousin of Principal Component Analysis -- to find extraversion score for each subject of the questionnaire.\n\nEnjoy!","bd8fb719":"# Proving that F1 is indeed extraversion\n\nIf F1 is indeed extraversion, then the questions that contribute positively to this factor should be statements like:\n\n- I like large social gatherings\n- I like being with people\n\nwhile the questions that contribute negatively to this factor should be statements like:\n\n- I enjoy being alone\n- I prefer not going out with many people\n\nSo let's just see if this is true, shall we?","bac4e60f":"People are mostly in the middle: not too extroverted, not too introverted; just in the middle.\n\nWe can forcibly divide people into extroverts (extraversion score > 0) and introverts (extraversion score < 0), but considering most of the people is lumped near 0, I'm not sure if that's appropriate? But it is doable anyway if absolute categorization is needed.\n\n*Remember: extrovert-introvert is not hard-bordered category. It is a spectrum.*\n\nNevertheless, there are some interesting things we can learn from the above distribution plot:\n\n1. The center of the distribution is not exactly at 0. It is slightly to the left. Meaning, majority of people is slightly introverted!\n\n2. The right end of the distribution reaches +3, while the left end of the distribution only reaches about -2.5. This can mean that being extremely introverted is quite rarer compared to being extremely extroverted.","56b71440":"The above table shows the \"loading\" value for each variable to the common factor extraversion (F1).\n\n- Loading sign tells whether a question contributes positively or negatively.\n- Loading magnitude tells whether a question's contribution is large.\n\nIf it helps, the relationship can be mathematically formulated as:\n\n$$\nF = b_{1} \\times Q_{1} + b_{2} \\times Q_{2} + ... + b_{90} \\times Q_{90} + b_{91} \\times Q_{91}\n$$\n\nwhere $b$ is the loading value.","324a54c2":"As seen above, the dataset we're going to analyze is the result of a personality test questionnaire. There are 7187 people answering, and there are 91 questions being asked.\n\nThe difficult part (for me in the beginning of this analysis anyway) is to decide \"how exactly can I predict\/separate extroverts from introverts?\"\n\nAll we've got is questionnaire answers; there is no column that says \"this person is extrovert\/introvert\".\n\nSo let's just try anyway."}}
