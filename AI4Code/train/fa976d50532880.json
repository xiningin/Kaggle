Africa seems to have the least ones. It is clear that Europe and Asia have the most inlets. Australia, Newzealand and Papua New Guienea are almost completely surrounded by bays. We can make this static map more interactive using `folium`.","92ea0a2b":"## Folium \n\nThe folium package makes it easy to create an interactive web map. We can not only show the locations of our inlets but also display various attributes.","ac03bb9c":"## Doing a bit Statistics\n\nLastly, let us get our eyes on the number of bays and their surrounding continents. Here we will use the `matplotlib.pyplot` package and create a bar chart. We will try to find which continent has the most gulfs\/bays.","951a4c7c":"If you click on the markers, you can see the name of the gulf\/bay and which sea or ocean it belongs to. The `popup` parameter makes it possible.","232d439e":"The `read_csv()` method returns a DataFrame. To investigate in details about the DataFrame, we can use the `info()` method. This will show us some important aspects of the data e.g. data type, non-null values,  memory usage etc. In this case, we have 4 objects (strings) and 2 float64 type data in total 6 columns. The most important thing  to notice here is that there is no null values. Therefore, investigating with `info()` will make our life a bit easier.","01968193":"## Exploring the Data File\n\nLet us take a look at our data. Though in kaggle dataset, the description of rows and columns can be found, it is a good practice to have a glimpse of the data using `head()` method. It shows the first five rows of the data file.","11d16b7a":"## Visualizing the Geospatial Data\n\nFirstly, we can see the world distribution of Gulfs and Bays. The Geopandas package is used here. We convert the DataFrame to a GeoDataFrame. We also need a world map shapefile. The Geopandas can read .shp file using the `read_file()` method. ","d0106331":"It is evident that most of the bays and gulfs are assosicated with Asia. The conjugate continents share a certain number of inlets but the number is small compared to individual continents. As we get back to our map, we can see that Asia and Oceania do have the dense distribution of bays and gulfs. Interestingly, the North America and Europe have almost equal number of inlets. We did not get this picture clearly from the map. However, now we have got a descriptive view of our geospatial perspective. Therefore, getting insights from both perspectives can be helpful in clearly understanding a spatial distribution."}}
