The current version of the model only has an accuracy of 48%.  When tested with data that it has not yet seen (2018 movies) the results are pretty convincing. For now, it is able to retrieve a sample description from the user as the input and will output the likeliest Genre tag for that description. Right now this is using the pipeline `model = Pipeline([('vectorizer',CountVectorizer()),('tfidf',TfidfTransformer()),('clf',OneVsRestClassifier(LinearSVC(class_weight='balanced')))])` for its prediction. What it basically does it look for frequency of the words from the description and create its mapping from there. From that mapping, the new descriptions can then be classified based on the frequency of words as well.\n\nThis could still be improved with the use of Deep Learning, with the use of LSTM or Conv1D (in wavenet configuration) we could possibly make the model think of the context of the description based on the arrangement of the words instead of just the frequency.","43c4ad3e":"## Some Preprocessing\n\nHere I did some preprocessing of the data. We will remove the punctuation marks for the description and make them all lower case. We also make the Genre lower case for uniformity as well. If we do not do this then we could end up with multiple labels as the code will see the different cased genre as unique even though they point to the same genre.","08bbc5e2":"## Summary\n\nFor now we have created a model that can classify an input description to a genre. We can still improve on the accuracy of the model, so far we only have a score of 0.495 although it can convincingly ouput a genre that is within the actual genre classification of the target.\n\nSome improvements for this would be:\n\n* The use of an ANN (for improved classification but still frequency based) or the use of RNN-LSTM or Conv1D (WaveNet configuration) for analysis on the arrangement of the words and not just the frequency.\n\n* A possible feature for this would be to output the top 3 Genre for the given description. One possbile way to do this would be the use of cosine similarity although I have to figure out first how to add it to the pipeline.","c3e6b3fe":"## Balancing the dataset","873f47e0":"## Cleaning up the description (Again)\n\nThis time we are going after the spaces, new lines, and digits (0-9) in the data.","f4e90011":"## Trimming up less frequent genre\n\nReviewing the dataset, we can see that there are genre that appear less frequent than others. For example we have `musical` which only appears 5 times or `western` which only has 7 entries. To avoid under-representation I trimmed up the genre and made one new genre `others` to cover all the genres that have less than 100 entries.","5aa6d8b9":"## Saving the model\n\nsource: https:\/\/machinelearningmastery.com\/save-load-machine-learning-models-python-scikit-learn\/","ebaadd00":"## Splitting up the Genre into the individual components\n\nIf we look at the `Genre` column we can see that there are movies that have more than one genre.
