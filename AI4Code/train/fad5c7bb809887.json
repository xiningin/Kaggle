Almost every video, in fact.\n\nMeanwhile regarding views, most of their videos are below $10^7$ = 10 million views. Most of their videos are highly clickbaity, yet has that same views range (hence the dark blue narrow strip in the lower right of the plot).","67dceab0":"# Introduction\n\nThis is a supersimplified exploration. I try to keep it lightweight and for fun. Let's give it a go.","2c882de7":"# Does the title's \"*clickbaitiness*\" relate to amount of views?\n\n**Is clickbait a reliable method to gain views?**\n\nThe big question. Intuitively, the answer is somehow \"yes, it should be\". Clickbait titles affect views.\n\nThe challenge on working with this dataset is: there is no variable that denotes how clickbait a video is. We have to determine the clickbaitiness by ourselves using whatever tools we have on our disposal.\n\nPreviously (before this notebook), I've built a model to classify clickbait news titles. It can predict clickbait news articles pretty well.\n\nIn summary, the strategy is:\n\n- extract TF-IDF features from the title (we won't use the title metadata columns)\n- classify using gradient boosting model\n\nWe'll try to determine the level of clickbaitiness in 5-Minute Crafts' video titles using that model, and explore what we find. Let's go!","b476057f":"# Remarks and Closing\n\nApparently, clickbaitiness of a title does not meaningfully bring views up. At least, on this specific channel anyway.\n\nIt should be noted that the pretrained model was trained using **news\/article clickbait** vs nonclickbait (e.g. BuzzFeed vs The New York Times). It makes perfect sense for the titles of 5-Minute Crafts videos to be classified as clickbaity and more in line with BuzzFeed article titles. As opposed to, you know, NYT headlines.\n\nAnd that's it! I hope this has been useful. Happy data sciencing!
