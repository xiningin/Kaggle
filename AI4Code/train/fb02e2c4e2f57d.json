The objective, for a bank, is to maximize the number of detected frauds! Even if it means considering more non-fraud tuple as fraudulent operation. So, we need to minimize the False positives : the number of no detected frauds.\n\nIndeed, by modifying the class_weight parameter, we can chose which class to give more importance during the training phase. In this case, the class_1 which describes the fraudulent operations will be considered more important than the class_0 (non-fraud operation). However, in this case we will give more importance to the class_0 due to the large number of misclassed non-fraud operation. Of course the goal is to lose as little effective fraud as possible in the process.\n","5f47cd20":"One way to do oversampling is to replicate the under-represented class tuples until we attain a correct proportion between the class","59edc42c":"# Confusion Matrix","87ccba05":"However in this case given the fact that a PCA was previously performed, if the dimension reduction is effective then the PCA wasn't computed in the most effective way.
