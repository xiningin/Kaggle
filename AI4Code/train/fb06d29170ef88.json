I am confident that a domain expert would likely have more domain-specific insights for the factors, translating to a more robust model interpretation.\n\nWhere assumptions or simplifications were made, I have erred on the side of caution. For instance, in my model interpretation, I was merely describing the coefficients without going into detail about what they imply for the general public. However, I think a more thorough investigation of the model would prove to be extremely valuable.\n\nI want to thank the New York Times and County Health Rankings for the data. Thank you for reading.

","6cc38551":"1. The first factor seems to encompass a lot of indexes related to general well-being. Some of its most substantial positive loadings(> .8) are for the years of potential life lost rate, the percentage of fair or poor health, the percentage of smokers, the percentage of physical or mental distress, and child poverty percentage. Some of its most substantial negative loadings(< -.7) are for median household income, life expectancy, general income, and college percentage. It explains a lot of variables connected to welfare in high coefficients. And its positive direction is towards poor welfare. Based on the loadings, I can identify this factor as **poor general well-being** with decent confidence.\n\n2. The second factor has apparent connections to variables related to housing issues. Its biggest loadings(> .8) are for the percentage of severe housing problems, severe housing cost burden, and the percentage of severe housing cost burden. The percentage of homeowners has the lowest loadings for this factor. It is convincing that this factor is for **housing burden**.\n\n3. The third factor seems to be connected to the prevalence of hispanic population. Its most substantial positive loadings(> 0.8) are for the percentage of hispanic population and the percentage of people not proficient in English. Its most vigorous negative factor loading is for the percentage of non-hispanic white population(~-.52). Other variables, such as housing problems and youth population, with lower factor loadings also seem to make sense for hispanic population prevalence. As a result, I would determine this factor to be **hispanic relative population size**.  \n\n4. The fourth factor is mostly about suicide rates in the opposite direction, so we could interpret this to be **inverse suicide rate**.\n\n5. The fifth factor is for **uninsured rate** because that's all its concerns with high loadings.\n\n6. The sixth factor has mostly to do with care provider rates such as dentist and mental health(> .5). It seems to be inversely connected with rural percentage and long commute. Although its loadings are relatively weaker, we can probably conclude that it is for **care provider accessibility**.\n\n7. The seventh factor seems to be about the population age as the extreme youth percentage has a positive loading(> .55), and the senior percentage has a very negative loading(< -.86). We can somewhat conclude that this factor is for **population youth**.\n\n8. The eighth factor seems to be mostly about the crime rate and its contributing factors, so we will determine this as **crime risk**.\n\n9. The ninth factor should have weak loadings overall. The theme seems to be about the overall income as it includes median household income, 80th & 20th percentile income, long commute, and white household income. We will loosely define this factor to be about **overall income level**.\n\n10. The tenth factor seems to be highly related to population density. Its highest loadings are for density in km(\\~.66), traffic volumn(\\~.4), and Asian population(\\~.48), while its lowest loadings are related to lone drive to work. It is clear that this factor is about **population density level**.\n\n11. The ninth factor should be somewhat apparent, with its two biggest loadings being the percentage of American Indian Alaska Native(.75) and inadequate kitchen or plumbing facilities(.71). We will determine this factor to be about **native relative population size**.\n\n12. The twelveth factor seems to be mainly connected to black population. Its most significant loading is for the percentage of black population(~.44). A lot of its other loadings are seemingly problems more common in black communities. Some examples are low high school graduation rate, crime rate, and single parent households. One of its negative loadings is the percentage of non-hispanic white population. I think we can determine that this factor is for **black relative population size**.\n\n13. The thirteenth factor seems to be about urbanization with its most negative loading being about rural percentage and its most positive one about access to exercise opportunities. The [latter](https:\/\/www.countyhealthrankings.org\/explore-health-rankings\/measures-data-sources\/county-health-rankings-model\/health-factors\/health-behaviors\/diet-exercise\/access-to-exercise-opportunities) is defined to be specifically about facilities, which are more plentiful in an urban environment. As a result, we will determine this factor to be about **urbanization level**.\n\n14. The fourteenth factor is also straightforward as its loadings are all about food. We will determine it to be about **poor food environment index** due to its related variables and their directions.","0b67935f":"Now with the factors interpreted, let's transform the original columns into factor scores, and append `_fa_score` to the factor names. Then, we will merge the data back.","75da73c1":"> Overall, the more prominent positively correlated factors(>.2) are **income level** and **inverse suicide**.

The minimum amount of days counted for a county is only one, while the maximum is about almost four months. I am happy that the median is 50 days. Ideally, I want all counties in the analysis to have at least two months worth of data so that any of its heath characteristics can have a decent chance of exerting its influence if there could be any at all. With the current data and analysis, I will only include counties with 50 day worth of data to maximize the representativeness of the eventual infection picture and not exclude too much data. Please understand that I'm not a domain expert. I apologize that this cutoff point seems rather arbitrary, but I hope the rationale makes sense domain-wise.","c157a113":"## Model interpretation\n\nNext, we will explore the models in depth. As we go through the models, the following sections will be relevant to keep in mind.\n\n- [Boxcox transformation](#Box-Cox-power-transformation) for the relationship between the Boxcox transformed rate and real infection rate\n\n- [Factor interpretation](#Factor-interpretation) for understanding what each factor encompasses in more detail\n\nWe will discuss model differences first and then explore what they have in common.","2e0c8de1":"> The QQ plots would indicate that our residuals are normal, but their distributions do have slight heavy right tails.

In addition, I will do a **factor analysis** on the columns to see if it makes sense.","f2913198":"In conclusion, although linearity seems to be weak, it does exist for some explanatary variables with the response variable so that we can be confident on finding a somewhat useful linear equation. We can be fairly assured that decent normality is ensured and multicollinearity is alleviated with the factors. Moreover, based on the relationship graphs, we see no obvious pattern with the residuals, so we can be somewhat confident with homoscedasticity as well. With that said, we can proceed with the regression.","9b467469":"## Factor interpretation\n\nNow that we have collected all the significant factors, let's interpret them one by one. We will look at columns that have decent loadings(>|.3|) for easier interpretations.","2683a3c3":"> Here we are looking at two factors that have different effects on counties in states with different governor parties. The urbanization factor has a pretty obvious but weak linearity relationship with the transformed infection rate in blue counties, but that relationship cannot be found with red counties. On the other hand, the black population factor has a very weak linearity relationship with the transformed infection rate only for counties in red states. Overall, these relationships are difficult to spot because they are not especially strong.","c0006fec":"> The latest date of the data is May 13th, 2020.","36845baa":"> Together the 14 factors explain about 74% of the total variance.","87ceca74":"> This model is a lot simpler with less interaction terms. Let's look at the differing significant coefficients. The poor general well-being, the housing burden, and the black relative population factor scores are simplified to have an overall positive effect(.13, .095 & .12) on the transformed infection rate. On the other hand, the hispanic relative factor score is generalized to have a slight negative effect(-.086) on the infection rate."}}
