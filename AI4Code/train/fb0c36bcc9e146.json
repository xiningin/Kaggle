By joining COVAX, they commit to procure enough doses from the facility to vaccinate 10%\u201350% of their populations and also make an upfront payment to support vaccine development and manufacturing. The amount they pay is a reflection of the number of doses they want. These upfront contributions will support the facility to enter into agreements with vaccine manufacturers to secure future vaccine doses for participating countries. The more wealthier countries that participate, the more that the financial risks of investing in the development and manufacturing of multiple vaccine candidates will be shared (known as \u2018derisking\u2019) and the more doses that can eventually be purchased.\n\nLess wealthy countries (lower MICs and LICs) can participate as \u2018funded\u2019 countries, with their financial commitments covered by official development assistance (ODA). Within COVAX, a financing mechanism called the COVAX Advanced Market Commitment (AMC) will be used to raise funds, mostly ODA, to pay for vaccine supply to these funded countries.\nhttps:\/\/gh.bmj.com\/content\/5\/11\/e003627","e22756a5":"<a id=\"1.1\"><\/a>\n<h3 style=\"background-color:skyblue;font-family:newtimeroman;font-size:200%;text-align:center\">Incentivising wealthy nations to participate in the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access Facility (COVAX): a game theory perspective <\/h3>\n\nAuthors: David McAdams,  Kennedy McDade, Osondu Ogbuoji, Matthew Johnson, Siddharth Dixit, Gavin Yamey\nhttp:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1136\/bmjgh-2020-003627\n\nhttps:\/\/gh.bmj.com\/content\/5\/11\/e003627"}}
