If the data have few outlier mean will get inturupter while median will not. This is also tell the central tendency of the sample data\n\nTo find out the median of a sample, first arranged the data in increasing order and then get the middle data. That will be ","3503b377":"I am writing these because they have confused me for quite sometime. As these all are related to sample data and have derived from each other, many time people get's confussion.\nThese terms is very useful if we wanted to understand the nature of our sample data\nI would request you to appreciate.!!!","530217b8":"# 4. **Standard Deviation**\nStandard deviation is the standardization of the variance. As we know it become dificult to analysis the data if it's been too sparse ro spread. So standardization make it within the range so that it become easy to analysis it.\n\nStandard deviation can be calculated by under root of variance and it also related to the spread of the sample data.","1a7f642b":"# 1. **Mean**\nFor a given sample of data mean is the average and can be calculated by sum of the sample data values divided by count of data in that sample.\nMean tells about the central tendency of the sample data. So, if we know the mean of any sample data set, predicting any random data nature will be more likely near by mean. It might possible that it could be mean itself.\n\n\n\n","f31db421":"# 5. **P-Value**\n\np-value is related to the covariance and correlation of the sample data. So what does p-value signifies. It it the probability.? and why it's been associated with the sample data .?\n\nSo p-value is more related to the sample data in context to understand the nature of the data. By just getting the p-value we could say how our sample data is.? \n\np-value will be a numeric value which is if less or as close to zero signifies the sample data is having some pattern. I mean your sample data does have some relation.\nAs p-value increases means there is less correlation in sample data.","a7e6da3e":"# 6. **Z-score**\n\nZ-score is also related to the speadness of the sample. let's say you have some gaussian distribution where the mean is X and variance is some Y.\nThat means the range of distribution would be from X-Y to X+Y. Now there might be some data in the sample that is too sparse as x-axis value increase. \n\nSo z-score tell that in a distribution your central mean with variance does have some outlier. so if you skip the z-score probably you will get your prediction good. So z-score is a range in +ve and -ve from where the sample data doesn't added to be more significance.","a6ed2a65":"# 3. **Variance**\nVariance is more related to the range in which data has been spread. This range is calculated from the mean, i.e how far it's from mean in the both sides (positive and negative)\n\nVariance can be calculated as summation of the square of substraction of randon number from the mean divided by sample size - 1.\n"}}
