They can use this dataset for training a Siamese Neural network which is based on Few-Shot Learning Technique.  Few-shot learning refers to the practice of feeding a learning model with a very small amount of training data.\n<br>\nI'll be publishing a kernel very soon on how to train a siamese neural network based on the eye disorder dataset.","f9acdc51":"<center>\n# ** EDA : Eye Disorder Datset** \n<br>\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ezgY6qG.jpg)\n","47fdf38a":"## **Highlights**\n* Manully Cleaned\n* Balanced data\n* Three classes\n* GrayScale\n* Pixel values","d0921a58":"### **Distribution of eye disorders in dataset**","7d4872a2":"### **Displaying 5 images each of different Eye disorders**"}}
