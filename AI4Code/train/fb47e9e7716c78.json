The concept of news itself is not new and is a fundamental aspect of modern-day democracies. Journalists work to hold powerful entities and figures accountable and are supposed to be an ally of the people. Yet, distrust of the media is extremely common due to the nature of present-day society and officials constantly calling the media into question. Harmful conspiracies and propaganda aren't new but now have a platform to thrive and be spread among social sites. Companies and people are able to mask \"pink slime,\" or garbage-level information, as quality journalism. This is a problem, as most people aren't entirely media literate and can't tell the difference -- but a computer can.\n\n#### The purpose of this notebook is to use Natural Language Processing to train a model to tell the difference between \"fake\" and \"real\" news.","4e70c585":"### Some noticable points:","c142125d":"We can use the same algorithm to the test dataset to see how well it performs.","0ac00915":"## 4. Training the model","c54bebab":"- Why are \"read\" and \"featured\" the top two fake-news indicator tokens? Is it because an author was trying to claim that the story is real because it's been read a lot and featured elsewhere?\n\n- The same question goes for \"nov\" and \"washington\", which perhaps infers that a lot of fake articles came around election time in November and discussed the month and the capitol a lot.\n\n- It is clear that Reuters is reputable, but a lot of articles begin with a \"City Name (Reuters)\" which the algorithim must have identified as real. I wonder if the algorithm could still tell if an article is real if this identifier was removed.","82699b18":" - What criteria the model learned to make it incredibly accurate","4754839b":"It looks like even with the features that have non-zero weights, a lot of them have a value close to zero.

This includes terms like \"gop\", \"sen\", \"republican\", and more.\n\n- \"gop\" is often used more in fake news that real news, while \"republican\" is more often used in real news. This is likely because AP style tells journalists to refer to the party as \"Republicans.\"","4698ab4a":"These are all speculations, but it would be interesting to see how these terms are actually used within the test.
