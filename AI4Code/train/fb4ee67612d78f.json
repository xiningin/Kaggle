The column names are listed across the top.","5cb6facc":"If we want to see how the measurements vary by species, we'll need a better plot than that. \n\n**seaborn.FacetGrid**\n\n\nThe seaborn plots allow us to color the dots in the scatterplot according to species.\n* The code below creates a scatterplot of sepal_length vs sepal_width. \n* By setting hue=\"species\", we're telling Seaborn to create different color dots according to species.\n* Since Seaborn is assigning colors to each species, we need a Legend so we'll know what color goes with each species.\n* height=6 sets the size of the output plot. Try changing the 6 to a different number and see how the size changes.\n* The output plots are image files that could be saved to your computer, sent in an email, or added to Word documents.","5581e876":"**pandas.info() \n**\n* infor() tells us how many data points we have for each factor.

By specifying dataset.species.value_counts(), we only look at counts within the species column.","a7048546":"Now create histograms for the other three quantitative data columns: petal_width, sepal_length, and sepal_width.","79bb8f26":"Copy and paste the sns.FacetGrid() code from above and change it to plot petal_length with petal_width.","00a2361b":"WHAT WE KNOW SO FAR\n\nFrom the outputs above, we can see that the dataset has info on 150 flowers. Each row contains the petal width, petal length, sepal width, sepal length, and species name of an iris flower. We know we have 50 datapoints on each of the three species.\n\nThe goal is to use the measurements of each flower to predict its species. To have an idea of how we might do that, let's look at some plots.\n\nPLOTS\n\n**pd.boxplot()**\n\n* .boxplot() creates boxplots for the quantitative data. This allows to see the distribution of the data, compare between columns. Look for medians, spread, ranges, maxes and mins. ","3e5cf49f":"Do any of the boxplots suggest seperation in the data for all three species?\n\nseaborn.pairplot()\n\n* We can use sns.pairplot() to create plots of all the factors combined pairwise.","990382c2":"matplotlib.pyplot.histogram()\n\n* We can create a histogram of the data for each column to see if there's any seperation within each factor.\n* x=\"petal_length\" tells Python to only look at the petal_length column.\n*  bins=30 sets the number of bars in the histogram to 30. Try changing that to a smaller number and see what happens.","ea6b0f0b":"**pandas.describe()\n**\n* .describe() will calculate and output descriptive statistics for quantitative data in dataset. Notice that the species column is qualittive data and is thus not included in the describe() output.","a20425ce":"Seborn.boxplot()\n\nLet's use Seaborn's boxplots to inspect distributions of the measurements by species. \n\nRun the code below to see the boxplot of peal lengths by species.
