You have to check if there is possibly overfitting. It happens when the training accuracy is a lot higher than the test accuracy.\n- In deep learning, we usually recommend that you: \n    - Choose the learning rate that better minimizes the cost function.\n    - If your model overfits, use other techniques to reduce overfitting. (We'll talk about this in later videos.) \n","7d4fc06e":"### 4.4 - Optimization\n- You have initialized your parameters.\n- You are also able to compute a cost function and its gradient.\n- Now, you want to update the parameters using gradient descent.\n\n**Exercise:** Write down the optimization function. The goal is to learn $w$ and $b$ by minimizing the cost function $J$. For a parameter $\\theta$, the update rule is $ \\theta = \\theta - \\alpha \\text{ } d\\theta$, where $\\alpha$ is the learning rate.","93ea98a2":"**Comment**: Training accuracy is close to 100%.

But no worries, you'll build an even better classifier next week!\n\nAlso, you see that the model is clearly overfitting the training data. Later in this specialization you will learn how to reduce overfitting, for example by using regularization.

Similarly, if it is too small we will need too many iterations to converge to the best values. That's why it is crucial to use a well-tuned learning rate.\n\nLet's compare the learning curve of our model with several choices of learning rates. Run the cell below.
