So far our model has two convolutional layers. However, those are not the only layers that we need to perform our task. A complete neural network architecture will have a number of other layers that are designed to play a specific role in the overall functioning of the network. Much deep learning research is about how to structure these layers into coherent systems.<\/p>\n<p>We'll add the following layers:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/keras.io\/layers\/pooling\/#maxpooling2d\"><code>MaxPooling<\/code><\/a>. This passes a (2, 2) moving window over the image and downscales the image by outputting the maximum value within the window.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/keras.io\/layers\/convolutional\/#conv2d\"><code>Conv2D<\/code><\/a>. This adds a third convolutional layer since deeper models, i.e. models with more convolutional layers, are better able to learn features from images.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/keras.io\/layers\/core\/#dropout\"><code>Dropout<\/code><\/a>. This prevents the model from overfitting, i.e. perfectly remembering each image, by randomly setting 25% of the input units to 0 at each update during training.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/keras.io\/layers\/core\/#flatten\"><code>Flatten<\/code><\/a>. As its name suggests, this flattens the output from the convolutional part of the CNN into a one-dimensional feature vector which can be passed into the following fully connected layers.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/keras.io\/layers\/core\/#dense\"><code>Dense<\/code><\/a>. Fully connected layer where every input is connected to every output (see image below).<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/keras.io\/layers\/core\/#dropout\"><code>Dropout<\/code><\/a>. Another dropout layer to safeguard against overfitting, this time with a rate of 50%.<\/li>\n<li><code>Dense<\/code>.

Notice that our model has a whopping <code>3,669,249<\/code> paramaters.

Model building (part i)\n<p>It's time to start building our deep learning model, a convolutional neural network (CNN). CNNs are a specific kind of artificial neural network that is very effective for image classification because they are able to take into account the spatial coherence of the image, i.e., that pixels close to each other are often related.<\/p>\n<p>Building a CNN begins with specifying the model type. In our case, we'll use a <a href=\"https:\/\/keras.io\/getting-started\/sequential-model-guide\/\">Sequential<\/a> model, which is a linear stack of layers. We'll then add two convolutional layers. To understand convolutional layers, imagine a flashlight being shown over the top left corner of the image and slowly sliding across all the areas of the image, moving across the image in the same way your eyes move across words on a page. Convolutional layers pass a kernel (a sliding window) over the image and perform element-wise matrix multiplication between the kernel values and the pixel values in the image.<\/p>","4904e842":"## 4.

As explained in the <a href=\"http:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/generated\/sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler.html\">sklearn docs<\/a>, \"If a feature has a variance that is orders of magnitude larger than others, it might dominate the objective function and make the estimator unable to learn from other features correctly as expected.\"<\/p>\n<p>We will scale our data so that it has a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. We'll use sklearn's <code>StandardScaler<\/code> to do the math for us, which entails taking each value, subtracting the mean, and then dividing by the standard deviation.
