Through checking these additional factors by grouping with the manufacturer_names will help us provide greater information in checking whether these factors would cause an increase in lead time as well.\n* #### I'm interested in investigating engine_has_gas and engine_fuel as I believe this marketing play for engine_has_gas or technology advancements such as Hybrid Types for vehicles with high features in engine_fuel may increase the demand for low-demand vehicles.","216152bf":"# What is Pandas?\n* It is an exploratory data analysis tool which is somewhat similar to Microsoft Excel, but impertively more powerful as it is done in code.\n    *   Pre-requisites to understanding Pandas is a minor experience in object-oriented programming(OOP)\n\n## Our Goal\n* The Aim of this tutorial is to provide you a \"*crash course\"* understanding of the Pandas module without losing focus of another key target, [**exploring data of used cars**](http:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/lepchenkov\/usedcarscatalog)\n\n#### *** Note :- Kindly Click On The Blue Hyperlinks for the documentations behind the command\/datasets.***","9382bdec":"## Frequency Counts, Selection\n### Methods\n####            * We use the .groupby() on manufacturer_name and use the [.size()](https:\/\/pandas.pydata.org\/pandas-docs\/stable\/reference\/api\/pandas.core.groupby.GroupBy.size.html) which counts the number of times the manufacturer_name has been mentioned in the row.\n####            * We then sorted the value in ascending order and used [.iloc](https:\/\/pandas.pydata.org\/pandas-docs\/stable\/reference\/api\/pandas.DataFrame.iloc.html)[], to show the row indices from 0 to 15(excluding)\n####            * [**.to_frame()**](https:\/\/pandas.pydata.org\/pandas-docs\/stable\/reference\/api\/pandas.Series.to_frame.html) converts the series output to dataframe output\n###        *  Analysis\n####            * As seen in the result we can come under the consensus that the demand for the product is also lower as the increase in features may lead to higher prices which leads to lesser people purchasing the car and concurrently selling the product too.            \n","47872136":"### Further Analysis\nFrom this result, we can see that on average, **as more features increased, the lead time to sell the car also increased(checking duration_listed)**. This may be due to an increase in price as the number of features increased. There were also a couple of outliers where very less features also lead to longer lead time.\n\n### Further Thoughts\n#### We had found that more features lead to longer lead time for sales,hence, we also would like to check whether our assumption is true by checking the number of listings for the product.\n####        *  As more features leads to higher prices, we can assume the listings for the product would be less as well.","64a397dc":"## Display\n### The above command **imports** the file from the Kaggle folder.
