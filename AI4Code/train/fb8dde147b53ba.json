As explained in the beginning observing a year where the variance of earthquake magnitudes is large can imply that something was wrong at that year and it's worth investigating, in other words, why did the magnitude vary so much during that year in comparison to an average year where there is a certain amount of small earthquake with little to nonpeculiar behavior.","7aae3b14":"### As we can see via the skewness value even before plotting the distributions of our features, the magnitude, and depth features are positively skewed and a fair amount at that.it can be already assumed that the cause of the skewness in the data is the phenomena of 'black swans', we do not know when those swans or outliers will occur as with any natural disaster, but there are some earthquakes with significantly higher magnitudes and with higher depths than the average earthquakes which take on fairly low values of the same features.","762faf15":"## $\\text{Table of Contents}$\n\n* [1.
