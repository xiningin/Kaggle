The first two blocks follow the same structure:\n1. Apply a Conv2D layer with 3x3 kernel size and valid padding, then another Conv2D layer with 3x3 kernel but with same padding to keep the same dimensions\n2. Apply a BatchNormalization layer to avoid layers being too depended from one another and allowing each activation to have 0 mean\n3. A RELU activation and a MaxPooling2D layer with 2x2 kernel size and stride=2\n4. An element-wise Dropout layer applied to MaxPooling2D keeping 80% of the activation units\n\nThe final 2 layers consists of a Fully Connected Layer that uses a Softmax activation for classification.","94f35e86":"##  Display images\n\nTo check whether everything worked as expected, let's take a look at a few images from each folder.","5be75553":"# Read Directories & Folders","80d36363":"### Model Compilation\n\nHere we will use an Adam optimizer with a Cross entropy loss function.","86882307":"# Import Libraries","d9d1e9b5":"# Get train and test data"}}
