bivariate analysis.","8df98fb3":"##  Building Model\n\nIn this process I build three different model. There are **KNN, Logistic Regression and SVM**. From model building result, we can conclude that **KNN** best performance among the other models. ","81834ffa":"##  Univariate Analysis\n\nIn the univariate analysis I try to understand the distribution each feature visually and statitstic test. The data of each feature I visualize with histogram to see the pattern of the data. The data looks have normal distribution in a glance but I need validate this visual result with statistic test. I am using saphiro wilk test to know the distribution of each feature. From saphiro test we know that all feature doesn't have normal distribution.\n\n","873f8a0a":"## Bivariate Analysis\n\nIn bivariate analysis I try to know the pattern and correlation between predictor and target variable (**quality**). From boxplot we know that some predictor like **alcohol, sulphates, and citric acid** has positive correlation with target variable. From literaure we know that **sulphate and alcohol** apppears in fermentation process. So, it's make sense if the **sulphate and alcohol** has positive correlation wiht quality of wine. The sulphate and alcohol value indicate age of wine.\n\nHeatmap shows us the correlation between each feature. We can know some feature has strong correlation with other feature but it's not strong enough. ","645b674c":"## Oversampling\n\nBecause of dataset that we use unbalance, we need to balance it. It's to avoid bias in predicting label. I am using oversampling with SMOTE to balance the data. It's generate syntetic label of the data and we can avoid the bias.","842e903f":"## Load The Dataset\n\nfrom loading the dataset we know that the dataset has 12 features. They are chemical parameters in wine. In this project I try to classify quality of wine. From basic analysis we know there is not any missing value in the dataset. Almost of all feature has float data type except **quality** parameter. Then, I continue to EDA. "}}
