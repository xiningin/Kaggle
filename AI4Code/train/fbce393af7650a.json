We want to do this early in our project and match these quick correlations with modelled correlations later in the project.\n\n**Completing.**\n\n1. We may want to complete Age feature as it is definitely correlated to survival.\n2. We may want to complete the Embarked feature as it may also correlate with survival or another important feature.\n\n**Correcting.**\n\n1. Ticket feature may be dropped from our analysis as it contains high ratio of duplicates (22%) and there may not be a correlation between Ticket and survival.\n2. Cabin feature may be dropped as it is highly incomplete or contains many null values both in training and test dataset.\n3.

We may want to create a new feature called Family based on Parch and SibSp to get total count of family members on board.\n2. We may want to engineer the Name feature to extract Title as a new feature.\n3. We may want to create new feature for Age bands.

Hence using univariate effect size for feature pruning might drop features that have significant interactions with other features. Since the effect size is small, it might not influence the prediction result a lot.","02941cb1":"## Analyze by visualizing data\n\nNow we can continue confirming some of our assumptions using visualizations for analyzing the data.\n\n### Correlating numerical features\n\nLet us start by understanding correlations between numerical features and our solution goal (Survived).\n\nA histogram chart is useful for analyzing continous numerical variables like Age where banding or ranges will help identify useful patterns. The histogram can indicate distribution of samples using automatically defined bins or equally ranged bands.

A simple way is to generate random numbers between mean and [standard deviation](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Standard_deviation).\n\n2. More accurate way of guessing missing values is to use other correlated features. In our case we note correlation among Age, Gender, and Pclass. Guess Age values using [median](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Median) values for Age across sets of Pclass and Gender feature combinations. So, median Age for Pclass=1 and Gender=0, Pclass=1 and Gender=1, and so on...\n\n3. Combine methods 1 and 2. So instead of guessing age values based on median, use random numbers between mean and standard deviation, based on sets of Pclass and Gender combinations.\n\nMethod 1 and 3 will introduce random noise into our models. The results from multiple executions might vary. We will prefer method 2.","db6db12d":"## Analyze by pivoting features\n\nTo confirm some of our observations and assumptions, we can quickly analyze our feature correlations by pivoting features against each other. We can only do so at this stage for features which do not have any empty values. It also makes sense doing so only for features which are categorical (Sex), ordinal (Pclass) or discrete (SibSp, Parch) type.\n\n- **Pclass** We observe significant correlation (>0.5) among Pclass=1 and Survived (classifying #3). We decide to include this feature in our model.\n- **Sex** We confirm the observation during problem definition that Sex=female had very high survival rate at 74% (classifying #1).\n- **SibSp and Parch** These features have zero correlation for certain values.

For example: Master title has Age mean of 5 years.\n- Survival among Title Age bands varies slightly.\n- Certain titles mostly survived (Mme, Lady, Sir) or did not (Don, Rev, Jonkheer).\n\n**Decision.**\n\n- We decide to retain the new Title feature for model training.","f4399a71":"**What is the distribution of numerical feature values across the samples?**\n\nThis helps us determine, among other early insights, how representative is the training dataset of the actual problem domain.\n\n- Total samples are 891 or 40% of the actual number of passengers on board the Titanic (2,224).\n- Survived is a categorical feature with 0 or 1 values.\n- Around 38% samples survived representative of the actual survival rate at 32%.\n- Most passengers (> 75%) did not travel with parents or children.\n- Nearly 30% of the passengers had siblings and\/or spouse aboard.\n- Fares varied significantly with few passengers (<1%) paying as high as $512.\n- Few elderly passengers (<1%) within age range 65-80.","d1ef7e10":"Let us replace Age with ordinals based on these bands.","ad36fe33":"### Converting a categorical feature\n\nNow we can convert features which contain strings to numerical values. This is required by most model algorithms. Doing so will also help us in achieving the feature completing goal.\n\nLet us start by converting Sex feature to a new feature called Gender where female=1 and male=0.","c4bc008b":"**What is the distribution of categorical features?**\n\n- Names are unique across the dataset (count=unique=891)\n- Sex variable as two possible values with 65% male (top=male, freq=577\/count=891).\n- Cabin values have several dupicates across samples. Alternatively several passengers shared a cabin.\n- Embarked takes three possible values. S port used by most passengers (top=S)\n- Ticket feature has high ratio (22%) of duplicate values (unique=681).","e8326d66":"### Correlating categorical and numerical features\n\nWe may also want to correlate categorical features (with non-numeric values) and numeric features. We can consider correlating Embarked (Categorical non-numeric), Sex (Categorical non-numeric), Fare (Numeric continuous), with Survived (Categorical numeric).\n\n**Observations.**\n\n- Higher fare paying passengers had better survival. Confirms our assumption for creating (#4) fare ranges.\n- Port of embarkation correlates with survival rates. Confirms correlating (#1) and completing (#2).\n\n**Decisions.**\n\n- Consider banding Fare feature.","3da84dc9":"Now we iterate over Sex (0 or 1) and Pclass (1, 2, 3) to calculate guessed values of Age for the six combinations.","0df66fc7":"### Quick completing and converting a numeric feature\n\nWe can now complete the Fare feature for single missing value in test dataset using mode to get the value that occurs most frequently for this feature. We do this in a single line of code.\n\nNote that we are not creating an intermediate new feature or doing any further analysis for correlation to guess missing feature as we are replacing only a single value. The completion goal achieves desired requirement for model algorithm to operate on non-null values.\n\nWe may also want round off the fare to two decimals as it represents currency.","90067e0a":"**Which features are categorical?**\n\nThese values classify the samples into sets of similar samples. Within categorical features are the values nominal, ordinal, ratio, or interval based? Among other things this helps us select the appropriate plots for visualization.\n\n- Categorical: Survived, Sex, and Embarked. Ordinal: Pclass.\n\n**Which features are numerical?**\n\nWhich features are numerical? These values change from sample to sample. Within numerical features are the values discrete, continuous, or timeseries based? Among other things this helps us select the appropriate plots for visualization.\n\n- Continous: Age, Fare. Discrete: SibSp, Parch.","ac86485b":"Let us drop Parch, SibSp, and FamilySize features in favor of IsAlone.","5587105d":"**Which features are mixed data types?**\n\nNumerical, alphanumeric data within same feature. These are candidates for correcting goal.\n\n- Ticket is a mix of numeric and alphanumeric data types. Cabin is alphanumeric.\n\n**Which features may contain errors or typos?**\n\nThis is harder to review for a large dataset, however reviewing a few samples from a smaller dataset may just tell us outright, which features may require correcting.\n\n- Name feature may contain errors or typos as there are several ways used to describe a name including titles, round brackets, and quotes used for alternative or short names.","b3e52b85":"Convert the Fare feature to ordinal values based on the FareBand.","aa38b75c":"And the test dataset.","5c33f32f":"We can not create FareBand.","a869303d":"# Write the preprocessed data frames to csv"}}
