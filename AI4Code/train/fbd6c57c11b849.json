This access may allow an employee to read\/manipulate resources through various applications or web portals. It is assumed that employees fulfilling the functions of a given role will access the same or similar resources. It is often the case that employees figure out the access they need as they encounter roadblocks during their daily work (e.g. not able to log into a reporting portal). A knowledgeable supervisor then takes time to manually grant the needed access in order to overcome access obstacles. As employees move throughout a company, this access discovery\/recovery cycle wastes a nontrivial amount of time and money.\n\nThere is a considerable amount of data regarding an employee\u2019s role within an organization and the resources to which they have access. Given the data related to current employees and their provisioned access, models can be built that automatically determine access privileges as employees enter and leave roles within a company. These auto-access models seek to minimize the human involvement required to grant or revoke employee access.","214b406f":"Unfortunately due to some glitch file `test.csv` on Kaggle is broken, it has almost 1M records instead of 56K. We have to use another source for our data, luckily for us `CatBoost` library has Amazon dataset build in.","dbaff71f":"First, I'd like to draw your attention to columns `RESOURCE`,`MGR_ID` and `ROLE_FAMILY_DESC`. These 3 columns are high-cardinality categorical features. That means they have a lot of unique values and that makes them harder to encode. \n\nAlso, take a look on `ROLE_CODE` and `ROLE_TITLE`. These 2 columns have exactly the same amount of unique values. That\u2019s suspicious.\n\nLet's have a closer look.","bd1e708b":"Ok, that's it for our very short data analysis, unfortunately deeper analysis is out-of-scope of our today's topic.\n\nAt the end let's transform our data using the most straight-forward approach - one-hot encoding using [OneHotEncoder](https:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/generated\/sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder.html) transformation from [scikit-learn](https:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/index.html) package.\n\nAfter transformation we will fit [LogisticRegression](https:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/generated\/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html) and check it performance using 5-fold cross-validation."}}
