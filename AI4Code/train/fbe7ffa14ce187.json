If you know basic statistics, you can use **python** easily. \n1. Data Munging: Working with messy and difficult data. Like a inconsistent date and string formatting. As you guess, **python** helps us.\n1. Data Visualization: Title is actually explanatory. We will visualize the data with **python** like matplot and seaborn libraries.\n1.
