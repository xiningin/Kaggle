It shows how many years back they last time change their jobs. We get an idea about the frequency of their job change. \n2. Here interestingly, 1 year is the time line where most employess who are looking for a change followed by who never changed in past and then who changed 2 years back. Those who change are actually changing 1 year and 2 year gap. \n3. Employees who are staying, similarly 1 year followed by 4+ years then 2 years they last change their job. ","737d8398":"1.

We have 25% of employees leaving and 75% staying back.\n2. Most of the employees belong private sector and most of them are men. \n3. Many employees prefer to stay in developed cities, mostly under developed city people are leaving. \n4. Gender disparity is a reality in job sectors. Our analysis too shows, women and others are neglected. They are staying back or leaving is just a choice. Their education relevance has nothing to help them.\n5. Graduates will leave and we more graduates. \n6. Younger generation even if they dont have relevant experience will leave.

Lets put an imaginary line at 6.5 development index on y axis.Most of the yellow dots are below 6.5 index and purple dots above this line.
