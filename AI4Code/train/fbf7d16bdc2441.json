This is my first notebook. I'm exciting to be here and share some thoughts with all of you!\n\nThanks for all that shared some previous notebooks.\n\nAs inspiration, we have 4 questions:\n* 1- How can the data be used to predict weather conditions throughout the world?\n* 2- How do the variables relate to each other?\n* 3- Which variables have a greater effect on the climate variations?\n* 4- Does the amount of movement of the buoy affect the reliability of the data?\n\nFor the purpose of this notebook i will try to ask the 4th question.\n\n\nHere i will show some EDA and some graphics that help me understand the DataSet.

The buoys really moves and we see can make some assumptions, and with this, I ask myself other questions. Let's get a quickly view about this.\n\n##### Pacific\n - Larger grid of buoys\n - Grid more equal spacially distributed \n - Has more observation in time too ?\n - Longitude Variance about 90 degrees\n \n##### Indic\n \n - Lesser grid of buoys.\n - More movement in the buoys ?\n - Grid less equal spacially distributed\n - Longitude Variance about 40 degrees\n \n #### Why Indian Ocean has more movement ?\n - Buoy Quality ??\n - Some water ow wind currents ?\n - Some relation with Indian Monsoon?\n \n Note that Longitude cover by Indian is like a half than Pacific.","d5ad8d3c":"So, Here we see that:\n* The greater correlation is Air Temp and SST, with 0.95.\n* Longitude have a correlation of -0.61 for Air Temp, -0.58 for SST and 0.5 for Meridional Winds.\n* Latitude have a correlation of 0.2 with Zonal Winds.
