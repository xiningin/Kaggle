The wind is mainly comming form the east and that were the in-flux of No2 will be important, it will be recommanded to do more analysis on No2 profile over y-axis in the east face in order to give a reliable boundary condition of No2 concentration along the East face.

However, we only have a low resolution of wind map in periods of 6 hours. So we will need to overcome these two problem of space and time low resolution:\n1. Wind variation over time: the direct solution for that is to solve transport differential equation of the two component of the wind speed $\\mathbf{u}(t,\\mathbf{x})=(u,v)(t,\\mathbf{x})$. However, We are not going to this complicated solution. From the previous annalysis, we see that the wind does not vary it too much during the day. Therefore, we will use the wind data that we have for each 6 hours and interpolate to estimate the wind speed over all time. \n2. Low resolution: we have very rough resolution of the wind speed and also the initial solution, and even if we have a high resolution of these two parameters, it will be very CPU time consuming to solve numerically this differential equation in a large area with high resolution. We need therefore to consider a subgrid model, which will be an additional turbulent diffusion effect ([Turbulence Eddy Diffusivity](https:\/\/ocw.mit.edu\/courses\/earth-atmospheric-and-planetary-sciences\/12-820-turbulence-in-the-ocean-and-atmosphere-spring-2007\/lecture-notes\/ch13.pdf)).

By using the superposition principle, we can decompose the solution to a linear combination of a set of solutions that do not depend on the emission rate of each power plant. By using this trick, we can then find the best emission rate for each power plant by solving a simple constrained optimization problem. The optimization consists in finding the best fit of emission rate parameters with respect to satellite images.
