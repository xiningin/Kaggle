As we can see, Cluster 0 has very good scorers and rebounders, which is proved when we see which players are there: Giannis Antetokounmpo, Karl-Anthony Towns, Ben Simmons. And, in Cluster 4 we have the pure scores, like James Harden, Kemba Walker and Trae Young.\n\nHowever, I think that we could see a better grouping reducing number of cluster. This is why Cluster's 3 players are like the Cluster's 4 players but \"rescaled\", in other words, with less minutes played. \n\nI could say the same for players of Cluster 0 and Cluster 2, but, in this case, we have some differences in player's style: cluster 2 has more deffensive players. \n\nBesides that, Cluster 1 contains players with low stats in all areas, a lot of them had a few minutes to play in each game.","91709161":"And now I have the data ready to apply KMeans model.","8f603fd3":"# Model","ed7787d8":"And we have our dataset almost ready to apply KMeans model.","a46fbec4":"I did not dropped the Games Played column.
