The demand is very regular in time and in quantity. It is therefore easy to forecast and you won\u2019t have trouble reaching a low forecasting error level.\n2.Intermittent demand (ADI >= 1.32 and CV\u00b2 < 0.49). The demand history shows very little variation in demand quantity but a high variation in the interval between two demands. Though specific forecasting methods tackle intermittent demands, the forecast error margin is considerably higher. \n3.Erratic demand (ADI < 1.32 and CV\u00b2 >= 0.49). The demand has regular occurrences in time with high quantity variations. Your forecast accuracy remains shaky. \n4.Lumpy demand (ADI >= 1.32 and CV\u00b2 >= 0.49). The demand is characterized by a large variation in quantity and in time. It is actually impossible to produce a reliable forecast, no matter which forecasting tools you use. This particular type of demand pattern is unforecastable.**"}}
