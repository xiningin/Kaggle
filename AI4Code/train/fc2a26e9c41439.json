Plot `profit` (y-axis) vs `budget` (x- axis) and observe the outliers using the appropriate chart type.\n    4.

Check the number and percentage of the rows retained after completing all the tasks above.","6c1c72e8":"## Task 3: Data Analysis\n\n-  ### Subtask 3.1: Change the unit of columns\n\nConvert the unit of the `budget` and `gross` columns from `$` to `million $`.","6fabbc0c":"-  ### Subtask 3.7: Find the critic-favorite and audience-favorite actors\n\n    1. Create three new dataframes namely, `Meryl_Streep`, `Leo_Caprio`, and `Brad_Pitt` which contain the movies in which the actors: 'Meryl Streep', 'Leonardo DiCaprio', and 'Brad Pitt' are the lead actors. Use only the `actor_1_name` column for extraction. Also, make sure that you use the names 'Meryl Streep', 'Leonardo DiCaprio', and 'Brad Pitt' for the said extraction.\n    2. Append the rows of all these dataframes and store them in a new dataframe named `Combined`.\n    3. Group the combined dataframe using the `actor_1_name` column.\n    4. Find the mean of the `num_critic_for_reviews` and `num_users_for_review` and identify the actors which have the highest mean.\n    5. Observe the change in number of voted users over decades using a bar chart. Create a column called `decade` which represents the decade to which every movie belongs to. For example, the  `title_year`  year 1923, 1925 should be stored as 1920s. Sort the dataframe based on the column `decade`, group it by `decade` and find the sum of users voted in each decade.

Also make sure that for all of these movies, the `num_voted_users` is greater than 25,000.\nAlso add a `Rank` column containing the values 1 to 250 indicating the ranks of the corresponding films.\n    2. Extract all the movies in the `IMDb_Top_250` dataframe which are not in the English language and store them in a new dataframe named `Top_Foreign_Lang_Film`.","b7aa23de":"-  ### Subtask 3.6: Find popular genres\n\nYou might have noticed the `genres` column in the dataframe with all the genres of the movies seperated by a pipe (`|`). Out of all the movie genres, the first two are most significant for any film.\n\n1. Extract the first two genres from the `genres` column and store them in two new columns: `genre_1` and `genre_2`. Some of the movies might have only one genre. In such cases, extract the single genre into both the columns, i.e. for such movies the `genre_2` will be the same as `genre_1`.\n2. Group the dataframe using `genre_1` as the primary column and `genre_2` as the secondary column.\n3. Find out the 5 most popular combo of genres by finding the mean of the gross values using the `gross` column and store them in a new dataframe named `PopGenre`.","40172726":"-  ### Subtask 2.3: Drop unecessary rows using columns with high Null percentages\n\nNow, on inspection you might notice that some columns have large percentage (greater than 5%) of Null values. Drop all the rows which have Null values for such columns."}}
