However, the majority of asian countries record more cases than in North America, but less deaths. This is probably because there are more young people in Asia which make them less likely to die when infected by the virus unlike in North America. Or this could also be resulted from the inaccuracy of data in some Asian countries.","15fa32b4":"The result of this data analysis didn't help us much to get better understanding of the Covid-19.
