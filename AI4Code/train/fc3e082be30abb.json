It does pull up relevant answers, but it seems to me that the best ones don't always sit at the top of the list.  I want to try some semantic (meaning) based similarity matching with the thought that the most relevent answer will have the closest meaning to the question being asked.  I came across Google's Universal Sentance Encoder whigh is a derrivative of BERT.  This means that it does encoding comparison based on meaning.  I also came across a few good examples of visualizing the similarity.  The best one I've found can be viewed [here](https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/use-cases-of-googles-universal-sentence-encoder-in-production-dd5aaab4fc15).\n\nIf this works I will build this into my previous work (assuming I can make it all fit in the VM).\n\n# Set up Tensorflow","292d17ac":"# Go get the model","e557985b":"taking the dot product produces a similarity matrix"}}
