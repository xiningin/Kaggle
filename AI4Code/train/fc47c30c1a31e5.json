Added **Using Dask** at the bottom section.","c28c2c8c":"Based on my limited understanding, to perform task that involves iterating through the entire dataset serially,  (such as `describe()` and `len()` above), dask does not seem to perform better. The RAM usage is also very high. I feel like it's easier to just load all the data in memory using panda's DataFrame to perform computation rather than depending on dask's lazy loading. That is of course when your memory capacity allows you to do so. \n\nOn the other hand, I do realize the advantage that it can be very useful for selective operations that can be done in parallel such as filtering when you cannot fit all the data in memory. Imagine if we have 55 billions (instead of 55 million) rows of data now and we need to find all the taxi rides with exactly 4 passengers in 2010 March with fare amount less than $20.\n\nThe other advantage of dask is multi processing.  dask's `read_csv` (around 50+s) clearly performs better than pandas' `read_csv` (around 1min 20s to 1min30+s) and I believe it is due to this feature.","f30336fd":"With Dask and its dataframe construct, you set up the dataframe must like you would in pandas but rather than loading the data into pandas, this approach keeps the dataframe as a sort of \u2018pointer\u2019 to the data file and doesn\u2019t load anything until you specifically tell it to do so.\n\nSource: http:\/\/pythondata.com\/dask-large-csv-python\/","1f40db30":"# How to load all  55,423,855 rows of data into one single DataFrame about 2 minutes, and reload it the same next time under 5 seconds (your mileage may vary)","6bb44adf":"We might not need float64 (16 decimal places) for the longitude and latitude values. float32 (7 decimal places) might be just enough.\n\nSee https:\/\/gis.stackexchange.com\/questions\/8650\/measuring-accuracy-of-latitude-and-longitude\/8674#8674"}}
