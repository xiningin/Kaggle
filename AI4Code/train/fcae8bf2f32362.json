This study reviewed the literature and used the following 23 variables as explanatory variables: \n#X1: Amount of the given credit (NT dollar): it includes both the individual consumer credit and his\/her family (supplementary) credit. \n#X2: Gender (1 = male; 2 = female). \n#X3: Education (1 = graduate school; 2 = university; 3 = high school; 4 = others). \n\n#X5: Age (year). \n#X6 - X11: History of past payment.
