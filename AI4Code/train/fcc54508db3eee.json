So in order to maximize the odd of victory, a team usually have different playstyle based on the opposing team champion composition they play against with and ones they are familiar with. Teams can abrupt or avoid certain champions pick to be played by banning them during the drafting phase.There are two types of submissions made during the drafting phase. In the banning portions of the draft champions are removed from the pool of allowed submissions, whereas champions are added to the roster of the submitting team during the pick phases. The drafting alternates between banning and picking until both teams have a full roster of five champions, at which point the game is played. The structure of the drafting phase is displayed in Figure below. Note the asymmetry between teams (for example Blue bans first in ban phase one, while Red bans first in ban phase two) and between the phases themselves (ban phases always alternate sides, while pick phases \"snake\" between teams).\n\nAlthough different team composition might have bring advantanges to the team with better draft. The result of a game is always uncertain due to lots undertermined factors such as player's mechanic, decision making, condition and so on, just like any regular sport.

Because Baron provides a team huge powerspike in terms of pushing ability compare to permanent buff from dragon, which are effective for scalling to late game.

They are all played by human being and the match results can be affected by lot of reason and variable. There are many stats in the game can matter a lot and cut to the core of the game, just like gold difference, objective control (baron, dragon) and death count. Understanding them is crucially important, just like high field goal percentage, get to the foul line, get offensive rebounds, and not turn the ball over are important in a basketball match.\n\nBut there are still a lot stats despite carry lot of information but actually don't say much. People even lie to themself by making compelling story to predict t results by a player or a team over the course of a given season. Finally, sports with statistics always comes up to two issues: One is the fact that sports have small sample sizes, and Two is that human beings play them. They can perform well sometimes so do they can get distracted.[4] However, I believe using data with big sample size, especially with the global popularity of League of Legends, the data from the game will helps team to determine the key strategy and pick to win the game.","f459d36d":"## Determine what is the world champion team favourite champion picks \nFunPlus Phoenix (FPX) is a Chinese professional esport organization, recently entering in the League of Legends scene and won the 2019 League of Legends World Championship after defeating G2 Esports in the grand finals.

In September 2016, the company estimated that there are over 100 million active players each month.[2] It also has a large competitive scene involving dozens of teams participating in both national and international tournaments. \n\nThe game takes place across two broadly defined phases. In the first phase (or Drafting phase), each side takes turns assembling their team by selecting a unique character (called a champion) from a pool of 145 (as of this writing) without replacement. Then, in the second phase (or Game phase), each player in the match takes control of one of the champions chosen by their team and attempts to claim victory. Although not strictly required by the game, over the years players have grown to play their champion in one of five roles named after the location on the map in which they typically start the game, and often corresponding to the amount of in-game resources that player will have devoted to them.\n\n\n\nThis report will be mainly focusing on drafting and how it will affecting the result of a game.\n\n","b605c950":"Based on the result above, we know that 119 games were played in the 2019 lol worlds championship.It can be used to determine the champions win rate , ban rate, and presence rate in the worlds 2019 tournament.\n\nAs of patch 9.19 , there are 145 champions are available to play in the game.\n\nThe next stage is to find out how many unique champions were played in 2019  LoL Worlds Championship.","53827c17":"Based on the results above, it shows that one team has only banned 4 champion in the draft phase.

He was considered a strong pick due to strong early game and able to roam fast after level 6. Qiyana also has an over 70% ban rate and were presense in 90.76% of the matches, despite she is slightly weaker in the early game when played mid against mage or ranged hero, but she can also be played in the Jungle and has strong roam potential and great engage around objectives. Xayah and Kaisa are the only bottom lane champion appeared in the top 10 list, this is because both of them can reach huge power spike after getting 2 items compared to other champion right now. With the engage support being stronger at tht bottom lane this patch, they are able to burst down enemies faster than other bottom lane champion could.\n\n\nHowever, champions with high pick, ban and presence rate do not means they are overpowerd or confirm to win the match. League of Legends is a well balanced game and every champions can be played to match certain playstyle. But it doesn't mean those champions in the top 10 list are no different than the other champions, they are definitely stronger in this patch and hence they are always picked or banned. So to determine which champions and what champion composition performed best in the world tournament, we have to look into the champion win rate."}}
