Was the data ever tracked?\nIs the research effort to make this data whole worth it? Maybe.\nWatching every Super Bowl halftime show to get song counts would be pretty fun.\nBut we don't have the time to do that kind of stuff now!\n\nLet's take note of where the dataset isn't perfect and start uncovering some insights.\n\nLet's start by looking at combined points for each Super Bowl by `visualizing the distribution`. \nLet's also pinpoint the Super Bowls with the `highest` and `lowest` scores.\n","bde13a79":"\nIt turns out Michael Jackson's Super Bowl XXVII performance,\none of the most watched events in American TV history,\nwas when the NFL realized the value of Super Bowl airtime and decided they needed to sign big name acts from then on out.\n\nThe halftime shows before MJ indeed weren't that impressive,\nwhich we can see by filtering our `halftime_musician data`.\n","31ca9515":"From the visual inspection of TV and halftime musicians data, there is only one missing value displayed,\nbut I've got a hunch there are more. The Super Bowl goes all the way back to 1967,\nand the more granular columns (e.g. the number of songs for halftime musicians) probably weren't tracked reliably over time.\nWikipedia is great but not perfect.\n\nAn inspection of the `.info()` output for tv and halftime_musicians shows us that there are multiple columns with null values.\n","43daa68a":"From our previous inspections, the num_songs column has lots of missing values:\n\nA lot of the marching bands don't have `num_songs` entries.\nFor non-marching bands, missing data starts occurring at Super Bowl XX.\nLet's filter out marching bands by filtering out musicians with the word `\"Marching\"` in them and the word `\"Spirit\"` .\nThen we'll filter for Super Bowls after Super Bowl XX to address the missing data issue,\nthen let's see who has the most number of songs."}}
