Moreover when we look at the correlation map, we can see that they are inversely proportional but not a strong proportional, because the value is only '0.1'. \n\nEven so I am sure that strength characters have low range and intelligence characters have high range. Agility heroes should be balanced about this. Lets find out. ","d080921b":"Type and range stats are directly proportional strongly. The value is '0.7'.","019dc886":"150 range actually means it is a melee hero. So when type goes from 0 to 2, there are more ranged heroes avaible. (From strength to intelligence). We can see this at correlation map too. Lets bring it back again:","e5ea33bc":"Dota2 is a 5vs5 MOBA (multiplayer online battle arena) game. There are lots of heroes in this game to pick everytime the game starts. Lets see how many heroes exist. But first, we need to take a look at the columns of our data.","d55c74ac":"Type 0 is 'Strength',\n\nType 1 is 'Agility' and\n\nType 2 is 'Intelligence' in this list.\n\nLets use pandas' filter method to categorize these.","f6d8d375":"With using 'head' method of pandas library, we printed our new data frames' first 5 heroes; strenght, agility and intelligence heroes.","393fa2bc":"He is 'Treant Protector'. A living tree. Has a strong base damage. Probably a slow guy. Because I think strength and speed should be inversely proportional. Lets compare these stats.","f8ea7dfc":"There is a column called 'name' so we can arrange the heroes using their names.","2a57b3b0":"As we can see, there are 99 heroes in this game. Of course every of them has their very own special abilities to win the fight. Some of them are deadly fighters, some of them are good at defending their team mates etc. But basicly there are 3 types of heroes. Strength, agility and intelligence. Not all of them but generally strength heroes are durable fighters and can survive longer according to other heroes. Agility heroes have high DPS (damage per second) points with their fast attacks and moves. So generally the category 'carry heroes' (they carry the game to win the game as they are ultimate killers) are mostly chosen from agility heroes. Intelligence heroes are good at magic skills so most of them are 'support heroes' (they support their teammates, heal them etc. to take advantage for their team at team fights).\n\nEvery hero has both three of the stats. An intelligence hero can be surprisingly more durable than a strength character. But mostly, we don't see this situation.\n\nSo when we think a bit, we can see that generally 'strength heroes' should have high health stats ; 'Agility heroes' should have high attack speed and 'Intelligence heroes' should have high mana points. Lets analyse this.","c24387b9":"As we can see at this table, strength stats and range stats are not doing well together. Because in this game, generally big guys (durable strength heroes, 'tank heroes') handle things with melee combat. They are tough and not good at dexterity skills like range attack.\n\nBecause of their thin skin, mage heroes (mostly intelligence heroes) needs to stay away from hand-to-hand combat. So nearly all of them are range-attack heroes. We can see this at this table. Intelligence stats are directly proportional with range stats like 0.5 - 0.6 valuing.","fcd6bb92":"We can see that generally strength heroes have more damage than the others. There is a really harsh guy there. At around 85th index, cannot be sure. Lets find him\/her."}}
