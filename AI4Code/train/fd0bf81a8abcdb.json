Interestingly, we don't need to extend an existing class to create a PyTorch dataloader. All we need is an `__iter__` method to retrieve batches of data, and an `__len__` method to get the number of batches.","8b9fc4a6":"## Model\n\nTo improve upon [logistic regression](https:\/\/jvn.io\/aakashns\/a1b40b04f5174a18bd05b17e3dffb0f0), we'll create a neural network with one **hidden layer**. Here's what this means:\n\n* Instead of using a single `nn.Linear` object to transform a batch of inputs (pixel intensities) into a batch of outputs (class probabilities), we'll use two `nn.Linear` objects. Each of these is called a layer in the network. \n\n* The first layer (also known as the hidden layer) will transform the input matrix of shape `batch_size x 784` into an intermediate output matrix of shape `batch_size x hidden_size`, where `hidden_size` is a preconfigured parameter (e.g. 32 or 64).\n\n* The intermediate outputs are then passed into a non-linear *activation function*, which operates on individual elements of the output matrix.\n\n* The result of the activation function, which is also of size `batch_size x hidden_size`, is passed into the second layer (also knowns as the output layer), which transforms it into a matrix of size `batch_size x 10`, identical to the output of the logistic regression model.\n\nIntroducing a hidden layer and an activation function allows the model to learn more complex, multi-layered and non-linear relationships between the inputs and the targets. Here's what it looks like visually:\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/vDOGEkG.png)\n\nThe activation function we'll use here is called a **Rectified Linear Unit** or **ReLU**, and it has a really simple formula: `relu(x) = max(0,x)` i.e. if an element is negative, we replace it by 0, otherwise we leave it unchanged.\n\nTo define the model, we extend the `nn.Module` class, just as we did with logistic regression.","01cb301a":"Let's define a helper function to ensure that our code uses the GPU if available, and defaults to using the CPU if it isn't.","69588ebe":"Our current model outperforms the logistic regression model (which could only reach around 86% accuracy) by a huge margin! It quickly reaches an accuracy of 96%, but doesn't improve much beyond this. To improve the accuracy further, we need to make the model more powerful. As you can probably guess, this can be achieved by increasing the size of the hidden layer, or adding more hidden layers. I encourage you to try out both these approaches and see which one works better.","e696bcad":"Next, we define and use a function `split_indices` to pick a random 20% fraction of the images for the validation set.","25a91fba":"## Preparing the Data\n\nThe data preparation is identical to the [previous tutorial](https:\/\/jvn.io\/aakashns\/a1b40b04f5174a18bd05b17e3dffb0f0).

GPUs contain hundreds of cores that are optimized for performing expensive matrix operations on floating point numbers in a short time, which makes them ideal for training deep neural networks with many layers. You can use GPUs for free on [Kaggle kernels](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/kernels) or [Google Colab](https:\/\/colab.research.google.com\/), or rent GPU-powered machines on services like [Google Cloud Platform](https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/gpu\/), [Amazon Web Services](https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/dlami\/latest\/devguide\/gpu.html) or [Paperspace](https:\/\/www.paperspace.com\/).\n\nWe can check if a GPU is available and the required NVIDIA CUDA drivers are installed using `torch.cuda.is_available`.","d178c05e":"The `fit` function contains the actual training loop, as defined ni the previous tutorials. We'll make a couple more enhancements to the `fit` function: \n\n* Instead of the defining the optimizer manually, we'll pass in the learning rate and create an optimizer inside the `fit` function. This will allows us to train the model with different learning rates, if required.\n\n* We'll record the validation loss and accuracy at the end of every epoch, and return the history as the output of the `fit` function.\n","63af795a":"We can now plot the accuracies to study how the model improves over time.","dd25d802":"## Summary and Further Reading\n\nHere is a summary of the topics covered in this tutorial:\n\n* We created a neural network with one hidden layer to improve upon the logistic regression model from the previous tutorial. We also used the ReLU activation function to introduce non-linearity into the model, allowing it to learn more complex relationships between the inputs (pixel densities) and outputs (class probabilities).\n\n* We defined some utilities like `get_default_device`, `to_device` and `DeviceDataLoader` to leverage a GPU if available, by moving the input data and model parameters to the appropriate device.\n\n* We were able to use the exact same training loop: the `fit` function we had define earlier to train out model and evaluate it using the validation dataset.\n\nThere's a lot of scope to experiment here, and I encourage you to use the interactive nature of Jupyter to play around with the various parameters. Here are a few ideas:\n\n* Try changing the size of the hidden layer, or add more hidden layers and see if you can achieve a higher accuracy.\n\n* Try changing the batch size and learning rate to see if you can achieve the same accuracy in fewer epochs.\n\n* Compare the training times on a CPU vs. GPU. Do you see a significant difference. How does it vary with the size of the dataset and the size of the model (no. of weights and parameters)?\n\n* Try building a model for a different dataset, such as the [CIFAR10 or CIFAR100 datasets](https:\/\/www.cs.toronto.edu\/~kriz\/cifar.html).\n\nHere are some references for further reading:\n\n* [A visual proof that neural networks can compute any function](http:\/\/neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com\/chap4.html), also known as the Universal Approximation Theorem.\n\n* [But what *is* a neural network?](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=aircAruvnKk) - A visual and intuitive introduction to what neural networks are and what the intermediate layers represent\n\n* [Stanford CS229 Lecture notes on Backpropagation](http:\/\/cs229.stanford.edu\/notes\/cs229-notes-backprop.pdf) - for a more mathematical treatment of how gradients are calculated and weights are updated for neural networks with multiple layers.","10321c52":"We'll create a model that contains a hidden layer with 32 activations.","6803f84c":"The initial accuracy is around 10%, which is what one might expect from a randomly intialized model (since it has a 1 in 10 chance of getting a label right by guessing randomly).\n\nWe are now ready to train the model.
