We're attempting to predict the position and orientation of all un-masked cars in the test images. You should also provide a confidence score indicating how sure you are of your prediction.\n\nPose Information (train.csv) Note that rotation values are angles expressed in radians, relative to the camera.\n\nThe primary data is images of cars and related pose information. The pose information is formatted as strings, as follows: model type, yaw, pitch, roll, x, y, z\n\nA concrete example with two cars in the photo: 5 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.0 0.0 0.0 32 0.25 0.25 0.25 0.5 0.4 0.7\n\nSubmissions (per sample_submission.csv) are very similar, with the addition of a confidence score, and the removal of the model type. You are not required to predict the model type of the vehicle in question.\n\nID, PredictionString ID_1d7bc9b31,0.5 0.5 0.5 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 indicating that this prediction has a confidence score of 1.0.\n\nOther Data:\n\nImage Masks (test_masks.zip \/ train_masks.zip) Some cars in the images are not of interest (too far away, etc.). Binary masks are provided to allow competitors to remove them from consideration.\n\nCar Models 3D models of all cars of interest are available for download as pickle files - they can be compared against cars in images, used as references for rotation, etc.","24307331":"### For ID_8a6e65317.jpg How many car are in picture.","96e13c0c":"In above dataframe trainData, let us visualize the first five image.
