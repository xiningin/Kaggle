To explain the dummy variable, we will simply do so. You have three countries.

This is not a small number. You can inform your manager of the percentage of Confidence  of  who will leave us at any moment and he will give the marketing team special attention. The last step you will take is to extract personal data and account numbers for people who may leave the bank at any moment.
