Tokenization is a process of extracting tokens (terms \/ words) from a corpus. Python\u2019s library Keras has inbuilt model for tokenization which can be used to obtain the tokens and their index in the corpus. After this step, every text document in the dataset is converted into sequence of tokens. \n","b8cb8545":"## 5. Generating the text \n\nGreat, our model architecture is now ready and we can train it using our data. Next lets write the function to predict the next word based on the input words (or seed text). We will first tokenize the seed text, pad the sequences and pass into the trained model to get predicted word. The multiple predicted words can be appended together to get predicted sequence.\n","fd559eba":"# Beginners Guide to Text Generation using LSTMs\n\nText Generation is a type of Language Modelling problem. Language Modelling is the core problem for a number of of natural language processing tasks such as speech to text, conversational system, and text summarization. A trained language model learns the likelihood of occurrence of a word based on the previous sequence of words used in the text. Language models can be operated at character level, n-gram level, sentence level or even paragraph level. In this notebook, I will explain how to create a language model for generating natural language text by implement and training state-of-the-art Recurrent Neural Network. \n\n### Generating News headlines \n\nIn this kernel, I will be using the dataset of [New York Times Comments and Headlines](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/aashita\/nyt-comments) to train a text generation language model which can be used to generate News Headlines\n\n\n## 1.

Before starting training the model, we need to pad the sequences and make their lengths equal. We can use pad_sequence function of Kears for this purpose. To input this data into a learning model, we need to create predictors and label. We will create N-grams sequence as predictors and the next word of the N-gram as label. For example:\n\n\nHeadline:  they are learning data science\n\n<table>\n<tr><td>PREDICTORS <\/td> <td>           LABEL <\/td><\/tr>\n<tr><td>they                   <\/td> <td>  are<\/td><\/tr>\n<tr><td>they are               <\/td> <td>  learning<\/td><\/tr>\n<tr><td>they are learning      <\/td> <td>  data<\/td><\/tr>\n<tr><td>they are learning data <\/td> <td>  science<\/td><\/tr>\n<\/table>","1656a7a0":"## 2.

Recent experiments have shown that recurrent neural networks have shown a good performance in sequence to sequence learning and text data applications. Lets look at them in brief.\n\n## 4. LSTMs for Text Generation\n\n![2.png](attachment:3750dda2-3786-4d6b-9cbb-bc1f99f71cd2.png)\n\nUnlike Feed-forward neural networks in which activation outputs are propagated only in one direction, the activation outputs from neurons propagate in both directions (from inputs to outputs and from outputs to inputs) in Recurrent Neural Networks. This creates loops in the neural network architecture which acts as a \u2018memory state\u2019 of the neurons. This state allows the neurons an ability to remember what have been learned so far.\n\nThe memory state in RNNs gives an advantage over traditional neural networks but a problem called Vanishing Gradient is associated with them. In this problem, while learning with a large number of layers, it becomes really hard for the network to learn and tune the parameters of the earlier layers. To address this problem, A new type of RNNs called LSTMs (Long Short Term Memory) Models have been developed.\n\nLSTMs have an additional state called \u2018cell state\u2019 through which the network makes adjustments in the information flow. The advantage of this state is that the model can remember or forget the leanings more selectively. To learn more about LSTMs, here is a great post. Lets architecture a LSTM model in our code. I have added total three layers in the model.\n\n1. Input Layer : Takes the sequence of words as input\n2. LSTM Layer : Computes the output using LSTM units. I have added 100 units in the layer, but this number can be fine tuned later.\n3. Dropout Layer : A regularisation layer which randomly turns-off the activations of some neurons in the LSTM layer. It helps in preventing over fitting. (Optional Layer)\n4. Output Layer : Computes the probability of the best possible next word as output\n\nWe will run this model for total 100 epoochs but it can be experimented further.","4f8a5d18":"Lets train our model now"}}
