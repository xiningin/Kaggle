Humanitarian crisis and COVID-19 in Yemen, By Shadi Abusneida In Sanaan, 02\/Jun\/2020\n\nYemen is experiencing the worst humanitarian crisis in the world. Financial cuts and the arrival of COVID-19 put millions of lives at risk. After suffering more than five years of conflict and displacement in Yemen people don't have a fixed place to live. They depend on the humanitarian aid they receive from the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR - The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) and other organizations.\n\nBut then came the COVID-19 pandemic, which poses a particularly critical threat to displaced people, who lack the resources to support themselves and protect themselves against the virus. With only half of the country's health facilities in operation today, many of those who need medical care are unable to access it.\n\nTo make matters worse, the assistance that millions of Yemenis and refugees rely on for their survival is threatened by a serious cut in aid financing. Starting this month, UNHCR will be forced to reduce its financial assistance program.\n\nYemen is experiencing the worst humanitarian crisis in the world. About 24 million people are in need of help and more than 3.6 million have been forced to leave their homes. Most of the displaced people live in unhealthy and overcrowded conditions, making physical distancing and regular hand washing impossible.\n\nDespite the extreme needs of the population, of the total of $ 211.9 million that UNHCR estimates as ideal for serving these people in 2020, only 63 million have been received so far. The amount represents the equivalent of 30 per cent of the total.https:\/\/translate.google.com.br\/translate?hl=en&sl=pt&u=https:\/\/www.acnur.org\/portugues\/2020\/06\/02\/falta-de-recursos-agrava-crise-humanitaria-e-covid-19-no-iemen\/&prev=search&pto=aue","f8b5c447":"#They depend on humanitarian assistance because there are no jobs\n\nIt is almost impossible to find employment in an economy close to collapse.\n\nThey depend on humanitarian assistance because there are no jobs. Without the money they receive, how can they live? They leave their homes and their families, they have no one there. \n\nIf UNHCR and other organizations are forced to discontinue their support, they would be forced to risk their health during the current pandemic to try to feed their family or face the possibility of starvation.\n\nTheir situation would be very bad. They would have to leave to find a job, even if there are risks of illness. \nhttps:\/\/translate.google.com.br\/translate?hl=en&sl=pt&u=https:\/\/www.acnur.org\/portugues\/2020\/06\/02\/falta-de-recursos-agrava-crise-humanitaria-e-covid-19-no-iemen\/&prev=search&pto=aue","99ff9a32":"Das War's, Kaggle Notebook Runner: Mar\u00edlia Prata @mpwolke"}}
