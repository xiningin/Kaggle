The unavailability of cabs at the airport in the evening slot may be due to the less number of cabs travelling from city to the airport (less number of request in the city at evening).\n\nCity :\nAs per the analysis, the morning time slot is most problematic where the requests are being cancelled. Most probably the requests are being cancelled by the drivers the reason being they have to wait for a long time or return empty, as their are few request for cab at the airport in the morning.\n","9d81b662":"Both the location have approximately same number of cab requests.\n\nLets look into the serviceability of the requests for both the locations.","8ca58c04":"No Driver ID was generated for the number of request that were denied due to unavailabitily of cars.
