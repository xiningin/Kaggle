The scholarship is basically whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program [Bolsa Fam\u00edlia](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bolsa_Fam\u00edlia).\n","3202ee21":"Here, we've gotten some more interesting outcomes.  \n\nFirst, we found that most people **aren't enrolled in the scholarship**.  \nHowever, what caught my attention was that the larger percentage of people who **pulled a no-show** were those who **had a scholarship**.

Weird... \n\nSecond, the schedule and appointment days don't appear in this summary. This must mean that they are in a false data type and need to be converted  \n\nThen: Hipertension (typo: should be converted to hypertension), Diabetes and SMS_received should be converted to booleans\n\nLast thing to note, the Handcap column (should be converted to handicap later) has a max value of 4. This column should indicate true or false, so I thought there must be an error here. After checking on [kaggle](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/joniarroba\/noshowappointments\/discussion\/29699#229356) (the origin of this dataset), this was the answer of the author:\n>...the handcap refers to the number of [disabilities] a person has. For example, if the person is blind and can't walk the total is 2. The problem is that patients with 1 handcap becomes unclear if this is blindness or antyhing else.\n\nTherefore, there's no problem in having a handicap value higher than 1! Neat!","bc979f34":"Now the age can start from 0 (being naturally a newborn). This is more like it.\nAlso, after checking on kaggle, the author of the dataset mentioned that age -1 is when an appointment has been made for a baby that hasn't been born yet. However, he recommended that we remove this row as it's probably an error.","f12bf287":"Common Language used throughout the analysis:\n>The word No-Show means that the patient didn't show up for their appointment.  \n>Pulling a No-Show is the act of not showing up for the appointment.  \n\n\n","01f6cb0a":"We have successfully created the column and filtered the invalid values"}}
