can see that highest rainfall is received between Jun-Sep which is the monsoon season in India.Oct-Dec is the season of return monsoon and cyclone season in the Bay of Bengal.A major city like Chennai only receives the return monsoon.Jan-Feb receives very less rainfall as this is the winter season across the sub-continent.Mar-May is the time for summer rains which is generally acompanied by thunder storms.","08762b9d":"We can clearly See that the Annual Rainfall column has maximum missing values.We have to divise a strategy to fill up this missing values\n\nWe can see that there are some missing

of rainfall in state of Kerala and India.This is a work in process and I will be updating the kernel in the coming days.The rainy season in India is called monsoon which is a word derived from Arabic.For more information on Monsoon you can go through my blog on this subject. http:\/\/btplife.blogspot.com\/2012\/06\/monsoon.html\n\nIn this Noteboo we Will be covering Following

in 1961 India received multiple cyclones.City of Pune was flooded in the year 1961 which is remembered as Panshet Flood.Due to heavy rains Panshet dam developed cracks and gave way.While the dam started cracking Indian army carried out emergency operation to stop flow of water.Sand bags were used to stop the flow of water.It gave people some time to evacuate before the dam was destroyed.Early morning water entered the city had caused massive damage.\n\nYear 1965-66 were twin drought years and there was food scarcity in India.Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri gave the Slogan Jai Jawan Jai Kissan to people of India.This lead to green revolution in India making India a food surplus country in the coming decades.\n\nThe red line is the 10 year moving average of the rainfall in India.It seems since 1960s there is slight dip in the rainfall in India.Now a days due to global warming the period of Monsoon season has shortned.We see more of erratic rainfall pattern.This needs more study.","598ef779":"1.From the above graph we can see that majority of rainfall is received in the month of Jun-Sep which is the Monsoon season.Oct-Dec is time of return monsoon.Jan-Feb are the winter months.Mar-May is time for Summer rains.\n\n2.Coastal Karnataka,Arunachal Pradesh,Konkan Goa and Kerala receive highest rainfall.\n\n3.Rajastan,Gujrat,Haryana and Punjab receives low rainfall.Interesting thing is that Punjab and Haryana have high agricultural output despite low rainfall.Their water requirnments are met by rivers and canals.","2ceddaab":"### Importing the 115 years
