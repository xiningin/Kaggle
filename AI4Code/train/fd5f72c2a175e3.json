High expenditure on health as a % of GDP per capita will increase life expectancy at birth. Because, it will tell us the investment and also the cost of health industry and accesibility to health services.  \n\n* under-five deaths : Number of under-five deaths per 1000 population\nUnder five deaths decreases life expectancy at birth dramatically. \n\n* Population: Population of the country. This variable survived every process I applied but it doesn't have a relationship with the life expectancy. Scatter plot shows that there is almost no relationship with life expectancy.I won't select this variable as an effective feature.\n\n* HIV\/AIDS: Deaths per 1 000 live births HIV\/AIDS (0-4 years)\nThis variable is like under five deaths. \n\n* Status: The status of the country developed or developing\nAccess to countries health services and also proper nutrition is significantly higher in developed countries. \n\n* pca_deseases : A new feature is created by using hepatitis B, polio and diphteria variables. It has the same explanation with HIV\/AIDS and under five deaths.\n\n\n\n\n","4e89d8e9":"* Infant deaths and under 5 deaths are highly correlateed (0,99)\n*   Winsorized schooling and winsorized income (0.85) are highly correlateed\n*   Winsoriez_thinness1_19 is correlated with winsorized_thinnes5_9.\n*   Winsorized_GDP or w.percentage expenditure are correlateed\n* Hepatitis B, Dipheria and polio is highley correlated in eachother. PCA can be used to reduce the correlated set of variables into a smaller set of uncorrelated features.We can create a new variable from these 3 variables by using PCA.\n* Measles or infant deaths are correlateed.\n* BMI is correlated with HIV\/AIDS.","49d66d4d":"We have mostly highly skewed variables. Winsorized lifeexpendancy, winsorized total expenditure and winsorizde schooling looks like a normal distribution.","c98481a6":"Let's look at the distributions of the variables by using histograms. Many models assume data is normally distributed. It will be nice to understand how our variables ditributed. If they are not normally distributed, it may still be ok to use them.","33e21c29":"**Outliers**\n\nWe need to find the outliers first to understand how to deal with them.\nThere are couple of methods to detect them. I will use boxplot to visualize each column.","7e9a4dbb":"We eliminated outliers according to Tukey's method and check again if there is still outliers. ","e71d347c":"P value shows that there is a significant difference between developed and developing countries. In the following steps, we can use status of the country as a feature. ","1460d608":"Scatterplots help us to identify a relationship between variables. \nI will draw scatterplots to understand the relationship between life expectancy and other variables.","884aedc2":"**Univariate visualization of categorical variables**\n-We have 160 developing and 33 developed countries.Let's look how life expectancy changes through years.","9874843c":"It looks like there is a positive relationship between life expactency, income and schooling columns.To check our insights and see correlations between other variables, we form correlation matrix and look for the results. If our columns correlation results are closer to 1 or -1 than there is a correlation between them.","db66a171":"Boxplots represent that we need the transform some of the outliers. I will applly Tukey's method and see the number of outliers. Tukey's method is also known as IQR, uses the range between 1st and 3rd quartiles. It classifies outliers if the values are outside the threshold of 1.5 times the IQR."}}
