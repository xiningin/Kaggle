To build on this analysis I may look to create some multiple regression models to predict cancelations, or dive into the topic of machine learning.","6444b64e":"It is clear that bookings made with larger lead times were more frequently canceled at both hotels. A possible explanation for this is that bookings made far ahead of the arrival date provide more time for the travel plans of the guest(s) to change.

I chose to exclude the variable *adr* as I suspect much of its correlation with *is_canceled* is being driven by its strong relationship with *booking_size*.

","78929676":"Before moving on I would like to quickly address the issue of outliers in the dataframe. As you can see from the summary statistics some variables clearly contain outliers. For example, *lead_time* has a maximum value of 737 days while the maximum numbers of *adults* on a booking is 55. There are many methods for identifying outliers and removing them but in some situations it can better to keep them. In the context of this dataframe I believe it is better to keep them. Without understanding how the data is collected it is possible many percieved outliers are actually valid numbers under the restrictions of the booking reservation system. Of course, some outliers may be errors produced by manually entered booking details, but once again, without understanding how the data was collected we cannot know with any certainty. ","89f9fd88":"Comparing the two hotels we can see that Resort Hotel had a larger share of domestic visitors than the City Hotel. At the Resort Hotel roughly 1 in 3 guests were from Portugal compared to only 1 in 5 guests at the City Hotel. Despite this, we see that the majority of guests at both hotels were foreign.

","e61e443b":"### Resort Hotel ","27366a03":"For the City Hotel we can see there is no clear relationship between the *adr_pp* and the cancelation rate. On the other hand it is apparent that as the *adr_pp* rises at the Resort Hotel, so does the cancelation rate. This suggests that guests of the Resort Hotel may be more price-sensitive than those at the City Hotel, and providing they have the ability, will not hestitate to cancel a booking should they find a better rate elsewhere. In addition, we can also see that  the cancelation rate seems to be rising year over year for both hotels.\n\nOn an unrelated note we have one outlier on the City Hotel subplot. For the month of July 2015 the cancelation rate was by far the highest of any month in the dataset despite the *adr_pp* being the lowest of any month. A possible explanation is that some external event in the city or region may have negatively impacted hotel demand and led to a large number of cancelations.","64ecce03":"Bookings made via an Online TA had by far the highest cancelation rate of all *market_segments* for the Resort Hotel while bookings made directly with the hotel or via an Offline TA\/TO had among the lowest.","ea0b9c59":"The distribution of completed bookings by booking size is remarkably similar between the hotels with roughly two-thirds of completed bookings having 2 guests.

First, notice that the mean and maximum values for the *adr_pp* are infinite.

On a week to week basis we can see certain weeks had a high number of completed bookings compared to the week prior or after.

We can find this information easily using the *datetime* module but first we must convert the *year, month,* and *day* columns into a datetime datatype corresponding to the arrival date. ","ca7dd315":"The data is originally from the article [Hotel Booking Demand Datasets](https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S2352340918315191), written by Nuno Antonio, Ana Almeida, and Luis Nunes for Data in Brief, Volume 22, February 2019.\n\nIt consists of hotel booking data between July 2015 and August 2017 for two hotels in Portugal, a city hotel and a resort hotel. The data was collected from each hotel's reservation system, where it was stored in a total of 8 tables, before being joined together into a single csv file. \n\nIn this notebook I will first clean the data, then visualize some of the booking patterns, before finally exploring the relationships between individual variables and whether a booking was canceled or not.","a6fef9de":"This subsection will look at the relationships between categorical variables and booking cancelations for the Resort Hotel.","e31339fb":"The general trend is that the longer the stay the longer the lead time. As we saw in the previous chart shorter lead times are correlated with fewer cancelations but so are shorter durations of stay. This raises the question of which of these variables, *duration* or *lead_time*, is the main predictor of cancelations? I'm inclined to think that *duration* is the better indicator and it just so happen that guests tend to make bookings with longer durations further in advance. Alternatively, it could be the other way around, or perhaps most likely, both variables have some influence?","19aa211e":"**Completed Bookings by Customer Type**\n\n","f4191d0d":"This subsection will look at the relationships between numerical variables and booking cancelations at the Resort Hotel.","2201cca7":"**Hotel Guests by Country of Origin**","0e6d189e":"For the City Hotel we can see the categorical variables most correlated with *is_canceled* are ***reservation_status*, *market_segment*, *distribution_channel***, and ***deposit_type***. For the reasons previously stated *reservation_status* and *distribution channel* will be ignored.","0c915e84":"### Resort Hotel","34aab785":"For both hotels the majority of completed bookings had a duration of 7 nights or less. However, the Resort Hotel had a much higher share of completed bookings for 7 nights than the City Hotel. These bookings were likely 7-night-stay package vacations booked primarily via a Travel Agent or Tour Operator. The most common completed booking duration at the Resort Hotel was 1 night. For the City Hotel the most common completed booking duration was 3 nights although stays of 1-2 nights and 4 nights were also frequent.","8390fae8":"**Completed Bookings by Week**\n\nTo assess weekly changes in demand a full calendar year worth of bookings data is required. Since the dataset only contains bookings between July 2015 and August 2017 we only have one full year (2016) to analyze. Fortunately demand fluctuations by week are relatively consistent year over year affected by factors such as school holidays, large events as well as more general seasonal variations.\n\nTo make the graph shown below more intuitive to the reader I restructured the way the week numbers were assigned to each day of the year. Originally the first week of year contained only 2 days (Jan 1st - 2nd) and the last week (or 53rd week) of the year contained a full 7 days (Dec 25th - 31st). Instead, the first week of year will now have the full 7 days (Jan 1st - 7th) and the last week only 2 days (Dec 30th - 31st). This adjustment should also better capture the demand around Christmas."}}
