Anything surprising?\n","3e67e708":"## Review Data\nBefore building a model, take a quick look at **X** to verify it looks sensible","17941ab7":"## Recap\nSo far, you have loaded your data and reviewed it with the following code. Run this cell to set up your coding environment where the previous step left off.","233b25bc":"## Step 4: Make Predictions\nMake predictions with the model's `predict` command using `X` as the data. Save the results to a variable called `predictions`.","3e24c3b6":"## Step 3: Specify and Fit Model\nCreate a `DecisionTreeRegressor` and save it iowa_model. Ensure you've done the relevant import from sklearn to run this command.\n\nThen fit the model you just created using the data in `X` and `y` that you saved above.","0f6a9963":"It's natural to ask how accurate the model's predictions will be and how you can improve that.

Save this to a new variable called `y`. You'll need to print a list of the columns to find the name of the column you need.\n","10ec0310":"---\n\n\n\n\n*Have questions or comments?
