Despite production of large amounts of recombinant GAA 22 annually, the structure of GAA has not been reported until now. Here, we describe the first 23 structure of GAA, at 1.7\\u00c5 resolution. Three structures of GAA complexes reveal the molecular 24 basis for the hundreds of mutations that lead to Pompe disease and for pharmacological 25 chaperoning in the protein. The GAA structure reveals a surprising second sugar-binding site 26\",\n    > ...\n  > ]\n> }","182ffa0b":"see files at https:\/\/github.com\/gisblog\/nih-covid19.\n\nfor e.g., potential answers for task 1 - \"WHAT IS KNOWN ABOUT TRANSMISSION, INCUBATION, AND ENVIRONMENTAL STABILITY?\" can be found here: (broken down by source type)\n* <a href=\"\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/gisblog\/nih-covid19\/master\/covid19\/kaggle\/working\/answers.task.0.biorxiv_medrxiv.json\">bioRxiv-medRxiv<\/a> (600 kb)\n* <a href=\"\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/gisblog\/nih-covid19\/master\/covid19\/kaggle\/working\/answers.task.0.comm_use_subset.json\">Commmercial Use<\/a> (9.2 mb)\n* <a href=\"\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/gisblog\/nih-covid19\/master\/covid19\/kaggle\/working\/answers.task.0.noncomm_use_subset.json\">Non-commercial Use<\/a> (1.7 mb)\n* <a href=\"\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/gisblog\/nih-covid19\/master\/covid19\/kaggle\/working\/answers.task.0.pmc_custom_license.json\">PubMed Central (PMC)<\/a> (1.2 mb)\n\npotential answers for task 3 - \"HELP US UNDERSTAND HOW GEOGRAPHY AFFECTS VIRALITY?\" can be found here:\n* <a href=\"\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/gisblog\/nih-covid19\/master\/covid19\/kaggle\/working\/answers.task.3.biorxiv_medrxiv.json\">bioRxiv-medRxiv<\/a> (660 kb)\n* <a href=\"\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/gisblog\/nih-covid19\/master\/covid19\/kaggle\/working\/answers.task.3.comm_use_subset.json\">Commmercial Use<\/a> (9.1 mb)\n* <a href=\"\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/gisblog\/nih-covid19\/master\/covid19\/kaggle\/working\/answers.task.3.noncomm_use_subset.json\">Non-commercial Use<\/a> (1.7 mb)\n* <a href=\"\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/gisblog\/nih-covid19\/master\/covid19\/kaggle\/working\/answers.task.3.pmc_custom_license.json\">PubMed Central (PMC)<\/a> (1.2 mb)\n\nwe can also geoparse and geocode the extracted NLP answers for visualization - see <a href=\"\/\/github.com\/gisblog\/nih-covid19\/blob\/master\/covid19\/kaggle\/working\/kaggle-geo.py\">kaggle-geo.py<\/a>.\n\ngeoparsed answers for task 3 - \"HELP US UNDERSTAND HOW GEOGRAPHY AFFECTS VIRALITY?\":\n\ncities -\n\n* <a href=\"\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/gisblog\/nih-covid19\/master\/covid19\/kaggle\/working\/cities.answers.task.3.biorxiv_medrxiv.json\">bioRxiv-medRxiv<\/a>\n* <a href=\"\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/gisblog\/nih-covid19\/master\/covid19\/kaggle\/working\/cities.answers.task.3.comm_use_subset.json\">Commmercial Use<\/a>\n* <a href=\"\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/gisblog\/nih-covid19\/master\/covid19\/kaggle\/working\/cities.answers.task.3.noncomm_use_subset.json\">Non-commercial Use<\/a>\n* <a href=\"\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/gisblog\/nih-covid19\/master\/covid19\/kaggle\/working\/cities.answers.task.3.pmc_custom_license.json\">PubMed Central (PMC)<\/a>\n\ncountry codes and counts -\n\n* <a href=\"\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/gisblog\/nih-covid19\/master\/covid19\/kaggle\/working\/country_mentions.answers.task.3.biorxiv_medrxiv.json\">bioRxiv-medRxiv<\/a>\n* <a href=\"\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/gisblog\/nih-covid19\/master\/covid19\/kaggle\/working\/country_mentions.answers.task.3.comm_use_subset.json\">Commmercial Use<\/a>\n* <a href=\"\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/gisblog\/nih-covid19\/master\/covid19\/kaggle\/working\/country_mentions.answers.task.3.noncomm_use_subset.json\">Non-commercial Use<\/a>\n* <a href=\"\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/gisblog\/nih-covid19\/master\/covid19\/kaggle\/working\/country_mentions.answers.task.3.pmc_custom_license.json\">PubMed Central (PMC)<\/a>","8f2a38e3":"**collect tasks' QUESTIONS \u2193**\n\nfor each task-question at https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/allen-institute-for-ai\/CORD-19-research-challenge\/tasks, create a list.\nalso create a detailed-question list and a specific-question list.\nnote, QUESTIONS are capitalized to better visually spot them from the answers during testing.","7e8d4e0f":"**function 1: fct_create_dict_of_papers() \u2193**\n\nwalk given path for papers.\nif conditions are met, then write paper paths to a main papers file.\n\nthis creates -\npapers.biorxiv_medrxiv.json,\npapers.comm_use_subset.json,\npapers.noncomm_use_subset.json,\npapers.pmc_custom_license.json.\n\nsee https:\/\/github.com\/gisblog\/nih-covid19\/tree\/master\/covid19\/kaggle\/working.\n\ne.g. papers.biorxiv_medrxiv.json -\n> {\n>   \"paper\": [\n>     \"\/kaggle\/input\/CORD-19-research-challenge\/biorxiv_medrxiv\/biorxiv_medrxiv\/pdf_json\/4602afcb8d95ebd9da583124384fd74299d20f5b.json\",...\n>     ]\n> }"}}
