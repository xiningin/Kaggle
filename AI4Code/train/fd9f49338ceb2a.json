One such application is building language models. A language model allows us to predict the probability of a word in a text given the previous words. Language models are important for various higher level tasks such as machine translation, spelling correction, and so on.\n\n- In this example, we will train a character based language model on the text of Alice in Wonderland to predict the next character given 10 previous characters. We have chosen to build a character-based model here because it has a smaller vocabulary and trains quicker. \n\n- The idea is the same as using a word-based language model, except we use characters instead of words.

This assumption breaks down in the case of sequence data. \n\n- Time series data, such as stock prices, also exhibit a dependence on past data, called the secular trend.\n\n- RNN cells incorporate this dependence by having a hidden state, or memory, that holds the essence of the past. \n\n- The value of the hidden state at any point in time is a function of the value of the hidden state at the previous time step and the value of the input at the current time step, that is:\n\n\n        ht = \u00d8(ht-1.Xt)\n        \n\n  - ht and ht-1 are the values of the hidden states at the time steps t and t-1 respectively, and xt is the value of the input at time t. \n  \n  - The above equation is recursive, that is, ht-1 can be represented in terms of ht-2 and xt-1, and so on, until the beginning of the sequence. \n  \n- This is how RNNs encode and incorporate information from arbitrarily long sequences.\n","8fa6de86":"- Finally, we are ready to build our model.\n\n- The RNN is connected to a dense (fully connected) layer.
