failed to attract international attention or financial assistance to tackle this epidemic and is now faced with emergence and possible dissemination of MDR-TB cases, which represents a major public health threat on both local and global scales.\n\nThis first study on basic TB epidemiology in Gabon illustrates that TB still represents a deadly infection in some parts of the world, despite the overall global progress in TB control over the past years. In this specific study area, the TB burden is determined by an unacceptably low rate of treatment success, a high rate of HIV coinfection, and the uncontrolled emergence of MDR-TB. The situation highlights the critical need for improving access to TB care as well as the establishment of DOTS, reinforcing in-country diagnostic capacity at all levels of the health-care system, and urgently providing access to second-line drugs for MDR-TB patients.\n\nDeath of every fourth TB\/HIV coinfected patient calls for improvement of integrated TB and HIV care, with special attention to INH resistance prevalence, which may impair prevention of HIV-associated TB. National and international recognition of neglected ongoing hot spots of the TB epidemic is a prerequisite for improving local health and for a globally successful effort to achieve the goal set for the post-2015 global TB strategy. https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4973203\/","d006109b":"#Tuberculosis Treatment Outcome and Drug Resistance in Lambar\u00e9n\u00e9, Gabon: A Prospective Cohort Study\n\nAuthors: Sabine B\u00e9lard;; Jonathan Remppis;;  Sanne Bootsma;; Saskia Janssen;; Davy U.

The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection rate was 42% in adults and 16% in children. \n\nMycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium africanum were identified in 82% and 16% of 108 culture-confirmed TB cases, respectively. Isoniazid (INH) and streptomycin yielded the highest resistance rates (13% and 12%, respectively). The multidrug resistant TB (MDR-TB) rate was 4\/91 (4%) and 4\/13 (31%) in new and retreatment TB cases, respectively. Treatment success was achieved in 53% of patients. In TB\/HIV coinfected patients, mortality rate was 25%. In this setting, TB epidemiology is characterized by a high rate of TB\/HIV coinfection and low treatment success rates. MDR-TB is a major public health concern; the need to step-up in-country diagnostic capacity for culture and drug susceptibility testing as well as access to second-line TB drugs urgently requires action.https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4973203\/","f9f376a3":"#Columns Names\n\n\"bmu\",\"Community engagement\",,\"Number of TB Basic Management Units in the country\"\n\n\"bmu_community_impl\",\"Community engagement\",,\"Number of TB Basic Management Units which implemented community-based referrals or any form of community treatment adherence support\"\n\n\"bmu_ref_data\",\"Community engagement\",,\"Number of Basic Management Units with data on referrals by community health workers \/ community volunteers\"\n\n\"bmu_rxsupport_data\",\"Community engagement\",,\"Number of Basic Management Units with data on community treatment adherence support\"\n\n\"bmu_rxsupport_data_coh\",\"Community engagement\",,\"Total number of patients who started TB treatment in the Basic Management Units with data on community treatment adherence support\"\n\n\"community_data_available\",\"Community engagement\",\"0=No; 1=Yes\",\"Are data available on community-based referrals or any form of community treatment adherence support?\"\n\n\n\"notified_ref\",\"Community engagement\",,\"Total number of new and relapse TB cases notified in the Basic Management Units with data on referrals by community health workers\"\n\n\"notified_ref_community\",\"Community engagement\",,\"Total number of new and relapse TB cases referred by community health workers \/ community volunteers in the Basic Management Units with data on referrals by community health workers\"\n\n\"rxsupport_community_coh\",\"Community engagement\",,\"Total number of patients who started TB treatment and who received any form of treatment adherence support from community health workers \/ community volunteers in the Basic Management Units with data on community treatment adherence support\"\n\n\"rxsupport_community_succ\",\"Community engagement\",,\"Total number of patients who were cured or who completed treatment among the cases who started TB treatment and who received any form of treatment adherence support from community health workers \/ community volunteers in the Basic Management Units with data on community treatment adherence support\"\nhttps:\/\/gitlab.procc.fiocruz.br\/oswaldo\/DS_2017\/blob\/4e8f97ebbd15bdba60c2e3c0d91298a24801a2c5\/exemplos\/TB_data_dictionary_2017-10-23.csv","268c15e7":"Video by https:\/\/treattb.org\/our-work\/stream-trial\/community-engagement\/","2d2ef411":"Das War's, Kaggle Notebook Runner: Mar\u00edlia Prata  @mpwolke","7af6da46":"![](https:\/\/bfr25cn2au-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/TREATTB_Inforgraphic2019_CommunityEngagement_Final_150dpi.png)https:\/\/treattb.org\/our-work\/stream-trial\/community-engagement\/","64470f5f":"<iframe width=\"976\" height=\"548\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/yPnT_ZQL0EI\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>","6b5a7584":"#Seven Steps to Community Engagement:\n\nSensitize, Map, Engage, Educate, Follow-up, Interact, Document. www.treattb.org","e02adf34":"After the snippet above the PCA resulted in : \"The least populated class in y has only 1 member, which is too few.

It can improve trial implementation and participant outcomes by building a relationship of trust between affected communities and trial implementers. It also allows affected communities to participate in all stages of the research cycle \u2013 from setting the research agenda through to evidence-based policy change based on research results.\n\nSTREAM Community Engagement\n\nCE is an important part of the STREAM trial, which is being implemented by STREAM Community Advisory Boards (CABs) at all 13 STREAM sites. The STREAM CABs play an important role in raising awareness of TB and the trial, and make complex information accessible to affected communities. They also provide psychosocial support to trial participants and family members, which can help improve retention and adherence rates. Finally, they act as a critical feedback link between affected communities and trial staff, sharing community views on key implementation issues.\n\nCommunity engagement is a \u201cmechanism of accountability\u201d to ensure trials and study teams are held accountable to governments, donors, and above all, trial participants. STREAM is committed to building sustainable CE institutions and supporting CAB activities.\n\nAs of December 2019, STREAM CAB members completed more than 136 trainings about TB, TB research and community engagement. These training sessions enable CE participants to deliver accurate information about TB and the STREAM trial, and equip them to participate in the research cycle. STREAM CABs also had held more than 748 meetings to plan their activities and provide feedback on the trial to the study team, as well as 372 outreach events with affected community members. STREAM outreach activities play an important role in raising awareness about TB, research and STREAM, and provide a venue for TB screening. STREAM CABs have also participated in more than 100 meetings in the national and international policy-making process, helping to ensure the views of those most affected by TB are considered by decision makers.  In the upcoming year, STREAM CABs will be very focused on planning for sustainability to ensure their impact can continue beyond STREAM.\nhttps:\/\/treattb.org\/our-work\/stream-trial\/community-engagement\/"}}
