The kanjis with radicals '\u4eba' are even perfectly splitted between elementary and secondary school. So, it looks like kanjis sharing a same radical are not specifically learned together at the same time.","e6dcf192":"## What about radicals ?\n\nA last question we will ask on this study, is about the repartition of kanjis sharing the same radical. Are they learned together, or spread over time. To work with significant samples, let's focus on the three most widely used radical.","f2cd9e15":"Thus, we will focus on radicals \u6c34 (*mizu*), \u4eba (*hito*) and \u624b (*te*).","d280c8ee":"## Number of strokes (complexity ?) over study time\n\nAs we can see, kanjis studied in secondary school have an average of 2 strokes more than those studied in elementary school. So it looks like an increase on complexity over study time. We can now check if it is a schema that also appear in a year by year view in elementary school.","e3b94299":"The increase in the average number of strokes within the years is obvious. The first curve appears to be logarithmic, meaning that the difference between elementary school years is higher than the difference between secondary school and elementary school averages. The box plot shows, nonetheless, that apart from the 1st year, there is a high variety in the number of strokes of kanjis studied each year.","921c5c9b":"Are there more strokes in the kanjis studied in secondary school, compare to the ones studied in elementary school ?"}}
