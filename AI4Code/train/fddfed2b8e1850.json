If you choose to use nested conditionals, add functionality so that you can accept multiple answers. For example, they can type \"yes\" or \"Yes\"**\n\n**Option 1: President Project**\nWrite a program that reports whether or not someone is eligible to run for president in the U.S. You should do the following in your program:\n\nAsk the user for their age, and store it in a variable.\n\nAsk the user if they are a citizen of the U.S.\n\nAsk the user how long they\u2019ve been a resident in the U.S.\n\nUse an if\/else statement with the proper comparison operator to print You are eligible to run for president! if they have the following credentials:\n\n* They are at least 35 years old\n* They were born in the U.S.\n* They have been a resident for at least 14 years\n\nAlso, print why the user is not allowed to run for president.\n\nAn example run of your program might look like this:\n```\nAge: 19\nBorn in the U.S.? (Yes\/No): Yes\nYears of Residency: 19\nYou are not eligible to run for president.\nYou are too young. You must be at least 35 years old.\n```\n\u2026 or like this:\n```\nAge: 40\nBorn in the U.S.? (Yes\/No): No\nYears of Residency: 5\nYou are not eligible to run for president.\nYou must be born in the U.S. to run for president.\nYou have not been a resident for long enough.\n```\n\nWant to make it better?\n* Allow a variety of yes or no answers (ex. 'yes', 'Yes', 'YES', 'yEs'...)\n* Tell the user whether they are eligible to run for Congress. To run for Congress, you must be at least 25 years old and have been a citizen for at least 7 years.\n* If the user is eligible to become president, point them to online resources about how to run for president.\n* Allow the user to choose their country at the start. Then, ask questions relevant to running for president\/ prime minister of that country. You will have to look up the requirements for other countries.\n\n**Option 2: Buzzfeed Quiz**\n\nFirst, take [this buzzfeed quiz.](https:\/\/www.buzzfeed.com\/abelle13\/design-your-room-in-the-loft-and-ill-tell-you-wh-f1qwgbjsa6)\n\nYou will be creating a quiz like this. You must use logical operators. For example, if someone chooses option a for question 1 **and** option 3 for question 2, then they are Jess. Here is some example output:\n\n```\nWhich New Girl Character are you??\n\nDo you consider yourself sporty or artsy? artsy\n\nDo you spend more than an hour getting ready in the morning, or less? more\n\nWhich job would you rather have: modeling or working in business? business\n\nYou are Schmidt! \n```\n\nMake sure you are using logical operators. In this example, the person is Schmidt because they chose artsy **and** more than an hour **and** business. You should get all of the same questions every time. You should have at least 4 unique results at at least 4 questions.\n\n","0cde71d4":"Ankith","27ab406c":"# Project: Boolean Variables & Operators","faf52b98":"# Reflection\n","7220d9b1":"# Code","ba575e7c":"<table>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Requirement<\/th>\n    <th>Description<\/th>\n    <th>Points<\/th>\n    <th> Earned <\/th>\n  <\/tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td> Originality <\/td>\n    <td> All code is your own.
