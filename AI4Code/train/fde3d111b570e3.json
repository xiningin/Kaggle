To proceed we need to install it in the notebook","0468328d":"![facemask_kitty.png](attachment:facemask_kitty.png)","353b415f":"### Information Typology in Coronavirus (COVID-19) Crisis; a Commentary\nhttps:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC7075270\/\n\n**Valid Information**\n\nThese are information that is based on the latest scientific evidence and is citable and applicable to others. For example, hand washing with a certain protocol can lead to elimination of the coronavirus.\n\n**Comforting Information**\n\nThese are information whose production and dissemination makes people happy and relaxed during the crisis. In the current coronavirus crisis, jokes, animations, poem manipulation, mass media entertainment and other content that decreased an individual's fears and anxieties about the coronavirus for moments, were instances of comforting information that act like a safety valve.\n\n**Perplexing information**\n\nThe kind of scientific information that has been produced in order to increase the knowledge of others, but is sent to an unrelated audience, is called perplexing information. For example, some high-level scientific information about coronavirus is sent to the general public or adolescents, who do not have enough knowledge and cannot understand it, which can in turn exacerbate their concerns. On the other hand, sometimes some simple content is sent to health professionals, for whom the content is elementary, and this can lead to wasting their time. Most of this content is shared on online social networks.\n\n**Misinformation**\n\nThis type of information is inaccurate and unreliable but the distributer of that information disseminates it inadvertently and pays little attention to the effects of this information on the society (2). In the Coronavirus crisis, bad news that was spread through online social networks such as WhatsApp, Telegram, etc. regarding the number of infected and dead people increased the fear and anxiety among people. However, if this kind of news is produced and distributed on purpose, it is no longer called misinformation; it is named disinformation because the producer(s) pursued inhumane purposes.\n\n**Disinformation**\n\nThis is the type of inaccurate information whose producers and distributors pursue political, economic, cultural, or other purposes and intentionally produce and disseminate it. This type of information is intentional, forging, and manipulative and distorts reality (2). This kind of information is usually produced and disseminated by rancorous people. For example, a message on the social media stated that a Bahraini officer said that the Iranian president and all his cabinet members were suffering from coronavirus disease.\n\n**Shocking Information**\n\nReading or hearing this type of information makes the recipient consternated, shocked and anxious. For example, in the early days of the Coronavirus crisis, information that illustrated the dangerous nature and behavior of the virus, like its contagiousness, was sent to the world from china. This information was unbelievable and terrifying to the general public.\n\n**Contradictory Information**\n\nThis type of information is produced and disseminated due to a difference of opinion between experts on a topic. In the current Coronavirus crisis, some experts initially declared that using a mask in the public was necessary, but some disagreed. Some even stated that the World Health Organization has behaved differently in this case.\n\n**Doubtful (Untrusted) Information**\n\nThis type of information cannot be validated or discredited due to insufficient scientific evidence. For example, in case of the new coronavirus, some have claimed that peganum smoke and consumption of garlic or other foods are helpful in disease prevention, and some have dismissed their effectiveness. The accuracy of these claims should be scientifically evaluated by health researchers.\n\n**Progressive Information**\n\nThis type of information fosters or leads to innovation, creativity, and production of new content in the future. For example, information obtained by health researchers about the nature and function of the virus during the coronavirus crisis will be the basis for future studies. This is the reason that it has been stated that the choice of research topics should be based on need. In fact, it is an example of research based on society's needs.\n\n**Postponed Information**\n\nThis information is presented to others with delay. If information is temporarily withheld, it will result in a consequence like distrust in society. For example, some countries initially did not disclose the number of cases infected with coronavirus, but with the increasing number of patients, they were forced to provide information.\n\n**Confidential Information**\n\nThis type of information is never revealed for various reasons and there is deliberation and expedience in hiding them. It is clear that many countries will not disclose the exact number of infected and death cases, because a greater number indicates the weakness of the governments and their health structure.","1454d5fe":"![ethics_education.png](attachment:ethics_education.png)","5f2d485b":"## External References\n\n[Too Many Patients\u2026A Framework to Guide Statewide Allocation of Scarce Mechanical Ventilation During Disasters 2018](https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/30316913)\n\n[CLINICAL ETHICS\nRECOMMENDATIONS\nFOR THE ALLOCATION\nOF INTENSIVE CARE TREATMENTS,\nIN EXCEPTIONAL,\nRESOURCE-LIMITED\nCIRCUMSTANCES 2020](http:\/\/www.siaarti.it\/SiteAssets\/News\/COVID19%20-%20documenti%20SIAARTI\/SIAARTI%20-%20Covid-19%20-%20Clinical%20Ethics%20Reccomendations.pdf)\n\n[Italy\u2019s health care system groans under coronavirus \u2014 a warning to the world.
