The objective, for a bank, is to maximize the number of detected frauds! Even if it means considering more non-fraud tuple as fraudulent operation. So, we need to minimize the False positives : the number of no detected frauds.\n\nIndeed, by modifying the class_weight parameter, we can chose which class to give more importance during the training phase. In this case, the class_1 which describes the fraudulent operations will be considered more important than the class_0 (non-fraud operation). However, in this case we will give more importance to the class_0 due to the large number of misclassed non-fraud operation. Of course the goal is to lose as little effective fraud as possible in the process.\n","237ea072":"We can see that the study using the reduced data is far from unrelevant, which means that the last step of the previously computed PCA could have been done in a more efficient way.
