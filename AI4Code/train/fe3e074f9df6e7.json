Some of them have them earlier in the week.\n* Not all countries have free days at all.\n* Most western countries have either free Sundays or free Weekends.\n\nSo, let's try and sort out some of the countries that don't have free Weekends\/Sundays. We're going to do this by collecting data from [this wikipedia article](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Workweek_and_weekend):","0b9c131a":"So, without getting too technical, we scrap the page's table and we actually do find some of those countries. Unfortunately, due to a mismatch in the country names between the dataset and the data from wikipedia, as well as some disputed countries, we'll need to do some manual work. That's a topic for another EDA though. We are just droping the ones we actually found and letting all of the others be.","aacc1025":"Now, the confirmed cases for some of the countries are split into provinces\/states, but most of the countries don't have that priviledge.
