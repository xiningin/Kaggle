Therefore, it is vital to investigate what motivates the customers to leave and make predictions accordingly, hence we can take action on those who are likely to drop out to prevent outflow. The telecom-users dataset contains around 6 thousand records of customers from a telecom company. The attributes include demographics of the customers, the services they subscribe to, the billing information, and most importantly, whether the contracts are renewed. The objectives of this notebook are to explore the relations between customers' features and churn and build models to predict whether a customer would leave. The notebook consists of five sections: \n* Import Data and Cleaning\n* Explore the Distribution of Target and Features\n* Explore the Effects of Features on Target\n* Preprocess\n* Build Models and Make Prediction","7c542b68":"**Effects of numeric features**","ad2721bd":"**First take a look at the target variable.**","5112cfb1":"There are 10 entries with null TotalCharges, from the column names we can infer that TotalCharges could be tenure * MonthlyCharges.
