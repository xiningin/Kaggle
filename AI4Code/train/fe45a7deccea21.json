The only challenge for me is that I work at university as a postdoc in climate science and although the salary and the projects are very conviencing, I do not have an unlimited working contract, and I have to search for jobs every 2 to 3 years, which makes my chances of finding new positions less as I age. I will try to find out how the chances are for me to move from academia to industry and find a job as data scientist or machine learning engineer. First I have to list which information do I have and compare my own skills with the survey of  <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/kaggle-survey-2019\/overview\"> Kaggle ML & DS Survey<\/a> in order to calculate my chances. As a usuall, climate scientist one has a good understanding of numerical model structures, high performance computing, statistical methods and software versioning. The languages used are mostly Fortran and Bash for climate models. For ploting, modellers use python, R, NCL or MatLab. I have also to mention that these models create massive big data problems for the mdoellers. All I heared about the career shift were based on some stories told of some individuals who made this jump. They most tell me, you have to apply, apply and apply. Ok, but wait! There is now this data from Kaggle. It might help me in more details than just apply commands!\n\n## What are my preferences?\nFirst of all I want to stay in Germany (Berlin). Second, it should be at least 50kUSD per year. With this told lets dive into the data.\n\n\n\n\n","5fc31e18":"# Results\n## Who are these guys on top of the Data-science-chain in Germany?\n\nData scientists with higher salaries (>125,000 USD) are the one with mostly doctoral title and work for big companies with more than 10000 employees. 40% of them are managers. They use the Amazone Web Services, especially EC2 on a regular basis. They keep themself up to date via Blogs and Journal Papers. They are 35 to 44+ years old and are from the beginning of the Data Science application in industry playing a role in the scene. Which means they have more experience than the junior or semi-senior data scientist. They peobably are the team leaders who juniors work for. \n\n\n## What should I learn or focus on for my next job as data scientist in Germany? \n\nGoing through all barplots, what I observed is listed in a priority ranking for myself :\n\n* Start Leaning SQL (PostgresSQL) in more details or put it on my CV: this is one of the skills that is a must to have!\n\n* Learn anything about Linear regression and decision trees with some knowledge of Neural Nets.\n \n* I have to master tensorflow and scikit for the next interview. \n\n* I have at least to burn some money (100 USD) on AWS EC2 to get used to it.\n\n*  Use more Seaborn and Matplotlib for my visualization.\n\n* I can apply for any company small to big ones. People like me can start from everywhere. \n\n* At least know word embeding if I apply for jobs in NLP. \n\n\n\n## Do I have a chance? \n\nDefinitely, the data says my chances are still high. \n\n## Aknowledgments\n\nSpecial thanks to Kaggle for providing this valuable data set. ","5669d2f8":"Well most of data scientist eran something between 50k to 125k USD in year in Germany. That looks great! I will at least try to tell 60k as my salary suggestion by my next job interview. But ofcourse I have to dive into the data to see if I have the same skills as these folk!\n\nIt can be seen from the diagram that there are 21 people in the survey from germany that earn more than 125kUSD in year. That might be my future salary if I was able to get a job as data scientist. For a bit of motivation for myself to continue writing this notebook I will first analyse this very little subset of data! I want curiously know why these guys earn that amount of money?  \n\nOne think that bothers me is the few number of observation. Do I really want to count on the data collected from 266 people? It means roughly, 266\/19718 x 100 = 1.35 % of the whole data. And 60 countries were involved in the servey. I think yes, on this subset I will rely, but later I will add some countries similar to Germany from the economical point of view who are within the Europe, like France.
