stimulus measures were deployed to sustain economic activity and protect the most vulnerable. There is a package of about $ 600 million to support the wages of workers in the ready-made garment sector, provided in the form of subsidized loans to companies so that they can pay wages for three months. This is very important because the ready-made garment sector is responsible for much of the recent progress in incorporating women into formal economic activity.\n\nAdditionally, takas totaling about $ 150 million will be provided as cash assistance to about five million families displaced by the pandemic. There are also measures to protect the homeless and for food distribution. Cash allowances for the elderly, widows, and disabled individuals are also being expanded.https:\/\/www.imf.org\/en\/News\/Articles\/2020\/06\/11\/na-06122020-helping-bangladesh-recover-from-covid-19","3ea9e22b":"Ds War's, Kaggle Notebook Runner: Mar\u00edlia Prata  @mpwolke ","b7e7a844":"![](https:\/\/www.atlanticcouncil.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Bangladesh-coronavirus-vulnerable-large-1024x683.jpg)","a22cec3b":"#Bangladesh\u2019s COVID-19 stimulus: Leaving the most vulnerable behind, New Atlanticist by Ali Riaz\n\nDr. Ali Riaz is a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council South Asia Center and a distinguished professor at Illinois State University.\n\nThe Bangladeshi government\u2019s $8 billion stimulus package, about 2.5 percent of the country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP), primarily focuses on industries, particularly export-oriented ones. In doing so, the package intended to contain and mitigate the economic fallout of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) left out the most vulnerable sections of the society and the sectors which desperately need support.\n\nThe stimulus measures declared on March 25 and April 5 by Bangladesh\u2019s Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina include working capital for affected industries (approximately  3.5 billion) and small and medium enterprises (SMEs) ( 2.36 billion). In addition, the government declared the expansion of the Vulnerable Group Feeding (VGF) and Vulnerable Group Development (VGD) programs, open market sales of rice at lower prices and expanding social safety net programs.\n\nThese packages have left the most vulnerable sections of society to fend for themselves and importantly ignored four critical areas. These areas are the informal sector, the public health care system, returned migrant laborers, and agriculture.\n\nThe situation is likely to worsen in the coming days. The desperation of poor workers was on display when thousands of readymade garment (RMG) sector workers defied the government lockdown and walked hundreds of miles to save their jobs at the prodding of the factory owners, prompting a sharp rebuke from the public. The RMG sector has been hit hard due to cancellation of at least 3 billion in orders and reportedly almost a million workers have lost their jobs. While the government offered  590 million in low-interest loans to the factory owners, differences between the owners and the Central Bank on the conditions of disbursement have left most of the workers unpaid.\nhttps:\/\/www.atlanticcouncil.org\/blogs\/new-atlanticist\/bangladeshs-covid-19-stimulus-leaving-the-most-vulnerable-behind\/","7c02d262":"The lack of support to the agricultural sector could also create a new crisis. With prices of produce dropping, farmers across the country are already bearing losses, and the absence of transport facilities are hindering the availability of perishable foods on the market. This is already affecting the food security of a large number of people, and it will only get worse; yet the absence of an incentive offered to the agricultural sector in the stimulus package is surprising.\n\nUnless the larger number of people and those on the bottom can benefit from the relief measures, Bangladesh will not be able to recover from this imminent crisis. To do so, the government needs to act quickly. https:\/\/www.atlanticcouncil.org\/blogs\/new-atlanticist\/bangladeshs-covid-19-stimulus-leaving-the-most-vulnerable-behind\/ ","97d7ec07":"#Amid the crisis, how can the country continue to address climate change concerns?\n\nClimate change is a priority for Bangladesh\u2019s development objectives, as it is one of the countries most vulnerable to extreme weather events. Increased investments in adaptation have made the country more resilient to natural disasters. Cyclone Amphan, a few weeks ago, was perhaps less devastating than initially feared because of better early warning systems and more investments in embankment infrastructure and shelters. As efforts to promote a green recovery take hold, Bangladesh is also well placed to attract foreign investment that will contribute to climate change mitigation.\nhttps:\/\/www.imf.org\/en\/News\/Articles\/2020\/06\/11\/na-06122020-helping-bangladesh-recover-from-covid-19","483abd66":"![](https:\/\/encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com\/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcTq0Rtr8yfOqC7nQ9GTIX6EDxnAiGHGuUORrQ&usqp=CAU)pt.linkedin.com","7dca7aef":"#Helping Bangladesh Recover from COVID-19\n\nOne of the most densely populated countries in the world, Bangladesh exemplifies the triple blow that many emerging market countries have suffered from COVID-19: domestic slowdown caused by the disease and the efforts to contain its spread; a sharp decline in exports, particularly in the ready-made garment sector, and a drop in remittances. Its once robust economy has dramatically slowed in recent months.\n\nThe economic impact has been felt in three main avenues: first, a drop in domestic economic activity, after the shutdown announced on March 26 (now gradually being lifted); the second is a decline in exports of ready-made garments, which represent more than 80 percent of Bangladesh\u2019s exports and have been strongly impacted (overall exports fell by 83 percent year-on-year in April). Finally, there has been a fall in remittances from Bangladeshis living mostly in Middle Eastern countries, affected not just by the pandemic but also by the decline in oil prices.https:\/\/www.imf.org\/en\/News\/Articles\/2020\/06\/11\/na-06122020-helping-bangladesh-recover-from-covid-19"}}
