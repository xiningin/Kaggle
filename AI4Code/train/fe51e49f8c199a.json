Rather, it means that the heart works less efficiently than normal. Due to various possible causes, blood moves through the heart and body at a slower rate, and pressure in the heart increases. As a result, the heart cannot pump enough oxygen and nutrients to meet the body's needs. The chambers of the heart may respond by stretching to hold more blood to pump through the body or by becoming stiff and thickened. This helps to keep the blood moving, but the heart muscle walls may eventually weaken and become unable to pump as efficiently\n![image.png](attachment:image.png)","60bbcfb9":"Finding probablity of death on basis of age","e936dbf9":"The normal number of platelets in the blood is 150,000 to 400,000","f1718941":"Exploratory analysis","75dcfcfe":"ML: Random Forest","435117e4":"A normal blood sodium level is between **135 and 145(mEq\/L)**.
