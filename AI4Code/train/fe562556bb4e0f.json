But this is almost never the case, in practice: it's far more likely for the agent to encounter a suboptimal (that is: worse than optimal) opponent.  \n\nSay the minimax agent encounters a suboptimal opponent. Should we expect the minimax agent to still play the game well, despite the contradiction with its assumptions?

(You can see an example of how to write a valid agent in **[this notebook](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/alexisbcook\/create-a-connectx-agent)**.)\n\nIf you decide to use the minimax code from the tutorial, you might like to add [**alpha-beta pruning**](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning) to decrease the computation time (i.e., get the minimax algorithm to run much faster!).  In this case, \"alpha\" and \"beta\" to refer to two values that are maintained while the algorithm is running, that help to identify early stopping conditions.  \n\nWithout alpha-beta pruning, minimax evaluates each leaf node.  With alpha-beta pruning, minimax only evaluates nodes that could provide information that affects the agent's choice of action.  Put another way, it identifies nodes that could not possibly affect the final result and avoids evaluating them.","9ef7af9c":"### Get Win percentages of 100 games","999828ee":"Then, follow these steps to submit your agent to the competition:\n1.
