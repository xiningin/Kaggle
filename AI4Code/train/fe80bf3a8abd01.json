Sentiment analysis is used to investigate opinions in Twitter data and it can assist organizations to analyse and understand about their brand. Twitter Sentiment Analysis is a stream of Social network analysis. This is also known as opinion mining","6a02ea42":"* by the above plot we can understand that in our data most of the data labelled as 0 with means positive sentiment, on the other hand label = 1 means negative sentiment."}}
