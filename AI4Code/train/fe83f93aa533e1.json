Also, if you look at the correlation of all the features, you will notice that strongly correlated Small Bags,Large Bag. It is logical but can create problems if we go to predict the price of avocado. I could be wrong, though.

This is obvious, because their cultivation is more expensive and we all love natural products and are willing to pay a higher price for them.\nBut it is likely that the price of avocado depends not only on the type.
