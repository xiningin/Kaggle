of view:\n\n- From the above plot we can cleary say that lower the serum sodium level, greater are the chances of a DEATH EVENT occuring.\n- It is a good indicator that early age - groups betwen 45 - 65 can sustain lower serum sodium levels but as the age increases rage of 130 is also beginning to look fatal.\n- All the people who have survived have their Serum Sodium levels mean above 135.\n- We

that we did get a good score using Random forest without doing much with a precision of about 71%. Using other Boosting algorithms would be an overkill for such a small dataset. \n\nMost important takeaway from this is understanding the relationships of the independant variables with the dependent variablle.

It's also called a serum sodium test. Sodium is an essential mineral to your body. It's also referred to as Na+.
