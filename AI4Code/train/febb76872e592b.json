We can recommend to the NYC city council to provide additional education activities in midtown Manhattan as it is signifacntly has less activities than other districes in the city and has a relativly high crime rate.\n3. Additional recommendation about enforcment, first of all using the heat-map created police may be able to map POI in the city and provide more manpower to those areas. \nThe police could use the suggester model to recieve hints about future locations of crimes and the profile of the future criminal teenager. \n4. Furthermore the model created could be utilized for tactiacl crime prevention and also to aid stetegic plans to fight crime around the city in the future.","4e9b5bf7":"# After School activities dataset\nLet's proceed with the after school activities (we will come back to the bigger historical crime dataset later)\n\nFirst some exploration:","02471f0f":"So Brooklyn has the most crime rate in the city at 2019, Manhatten is close second\n\nIs there any differences within the sexes within the different races?","3d20c6e7":"Wednesday has the most crimes, and sunday is the lowest, so the safest day is sunday in NYC!","d5dd0e80":"### The imports:","5cb7a7cc":"# Creating Crime predictions with MTR model:\nLets try to create MTR model to predict the loaction of a crime base on some basic features and then using the data lets try to forcast the next month. <br>\nI will check 2 different models Random forest and gradient boost regressors as the base estimators for the MTR. <br>\nFirst I will create the train and test data, later check the MSE of the models and later will present them on the map","7a9ac7cc":"We can observe that males conduct more crimes (or arrested crimes at least)\n\ncan we see if there is any changes within races and sexes in the different locations?","d3a7f177":"Ok still not that significant\n\nLet's move to more intresting and complex combinations:\n\nWhat is the crime distributtion within the location of the different races","44cd6a1f":"Sorting some of the data out (code to meanings, droping columns, etc.)","23d0a751":"### Lets further explorer the data\n\nIs there any specific day within the month that has more crimes?","ab976cd0":"# Map Visualisation \nLets show it over the map with interactive plotting - 2 forms of interactive ploting heatmap and plotly scatter plot (with time animation)","3b689bea":"Not really, Feb is a bit less crimey (Cause it is probably more cold) but still not significant\n\nLet's check the most arrested race:","cd5fa390":"The 20's - 40's seems like the most crime age\n\nIn which Borough in the city has the most crime?","a61748bd":"Blacks lead everywhere except staten island, white hispanic are always second.
