In health organizations have come up with apps supporting customer care services and collection of data Health Facility Database, National Resuscitation training among many more. AI in Kenya has also been used to conduct various research programs such as studying the specific areas that have a larger number of people affected by cancer compares to other regions which has been of great help to medical practitioners. Even the Banking sector hasn\u2019t been left behind where the leading companies are looking for smarter ways to satisfy customer demands and deliver quality services, ABSA bank of Kenya uses Julie, a chatbot as their customer representative. Similarly, Safricom uses a bot called Zuri to take the customer through various services like managing bills, transaction reversals and many more. \n\n\nAnother thing which is positioning Kenya to take the lead in the field of AI is the 1Million Startups initiative which works with entrepreneurs and helps to fast track the achievement of the Strategic development goals. The goal of this initiative is to build a community of 1 million startups with 1 million solutions. The resurgence of Xenophobic attacks in South Africa also presents another opportunity for Kenya to leapfrog its counterpart as a lot if investors are disassociating with the country and a lot of skilled workforce which will mean this will go to the next hot hub of AI in Africa Kenya. Kenya has also signed a Memorandum to host the next Einstein forum in 2020 which will be strategic as it will mean exposure for country\u2019s firms and strategic value to the nations standing in the field of sciences and innovation.","e0c51189":"><h3>Highlights<\/h3>\n>\n>---\n>Over 70% of employees in Kenyan startups are bachelor's degree holders.  21% or so have a masters degree and only less than 5% did not earn a college degree.","ad7f9add":"## <a>Does compensation depend on level of Education?<\/a>\n<a id=\"compvsedl\"><\/a>","a48a12bd":"><h3>Highlights<\/h3>\n>\n>---\n>Over the years, the number of respondents from the Africa's 'BIG 4' has been on the rise.
