a chunk of text, and classifying them into a predefined set of categories.\nFor understanding NER here is very good article : https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/named-entity-recognition-with-nltk-and-spacy-8c4a7d88e7da\n\nWe will be using spacy for creating our own customised NER model or models (seperate for each Sentiment).The motivation for this approach is off course the kernel shared by Rohit Singh,so if you find his kernel useful please upvote it.\n\nWhat will be different with my solution:\n* I will use text as selected_text for all neutral tweets due to their high jaccard similarity\n* Also I will use text as selected_text for all tweets having number of words less than 3 in text as explained before\n* I will train two different models for Positive and Negtive tweets\n* I will not preprocess the data because the selected text contains raw text","266f2a45":"# Most common words Sentiments
