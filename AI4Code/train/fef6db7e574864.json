In this section, we will take a look at the topic covered in those papers. I determined the topic of each paper by looking for specific keywords in the abstract. For example, if an article writes about \"transmission\" in the abstract, I will assign this paper to topic transmission.\n<p>Similar to the above section, the topic column will be added and assigned corrsponding values. After the assignemnt step, i got 7467 papers talking about \"genetics|origin|evolution\", 2085 papers talking about \"transmission\", 6469 papers talking about \"vaccines|therapeutics\", 219 papers talking about \"incubation\", 788 papers talking about \"non-pharmaceutical interventions\", 5430 papers taking about \"medical care\", and 326 papers talking about \"ethical|social\".

(The result is shown below)\n<p>For the first query, \"The risk factors of covid-19\", we get pretty great recommendations on the paper. We can see many of the recommendated papers contain \"risk\" and we can see that they described differnt kinds of risk factors. For researchers, governments, and healthcare professionals who are interested in reading the risk factors of the novel cornoavirus, i would suggest them reading the above articles. \n<p>For the second query, it asks about the genetics, origins, or evolutions of the covid-19. The results are also satisfying, as we can see the recommendated papers are about the genetic diversity, about the virus evolution. Therefore, if researchers want to find out the potential genetics, origins or evolution of the novel virus, I would recommend them reading those papers.\n<p>For the third query, it is about drugs or medicines to treat covid-19 patients. The returned recommended papers are very good as well. We can see some of the papers recommend chinese medicine. Thus, for healthcare professionals or the public heath department, if they need any information of the drug and medicine to treat patients, I would highly recommend them to read the above paper. \n<p>To conclude, there are over 45000 papers related to the new coronavirus, it would be a waste of time for the researchers to go through them one by one. A recommender system like this notebook did would save a lot of time. This would be a very fast way for researchers, governments, healthcare professionals to find more information about a similar, relevant material.

By the recommender system built in the previous section, researchers could just providing a specific query, or a paper title. Then the model will calculate the cosine similarity between the query and the dataset and return the top 10 or 20 similar papers for researchers to read. This indeed minimize their time and would be benefit for fighting against the COVID-19.\n<p>Next, I will run following querys related to the COVID-19 as some examples:\n\n* Risk factors of the novel coronavirus 2019\n* covid-19 genetics, origin, or evolution \n* Drugs or medicines to treat COVID-19 patients\n","0ee3af02":"# 2.
