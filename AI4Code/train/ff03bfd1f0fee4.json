When working on the answer this question and the several of the ones that follow, keep the following \"gotcha\" described in the [reference](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/residentmario\/indexing-selecting-assigning-reference) for this tutorial section:\n\n> `iloc` uses the Python stdlib indexing scheme, where the first element of the range is included and the last one excluded. So `0:10` will select entries `0,...,9`. `loc`, meanwhile, indexes inclusively. So `0:10` will select entries `0,...,10`.\n\n> [...]\n\n> ...[consider] when the DataFrame index is a simple numerical list, e.g. `0,...,1000`. In this case `df.iloc[0:1000]` will return 1000 entries, while `df.loc[0:1000]` return 1001 of them! To get 1000 elements using `iloc`, you will need to go one higher and ask for `df.iloc[0:1001]`.","772325fa":"**Exercise 6**: Select the `country`, `province`, `region_1`, and `region_2` columns of the records with the `0`, `1`, `10`, and `100` index positions.
