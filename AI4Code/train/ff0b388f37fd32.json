Among them, 2 datasets are official meaning that is provided by PASSNYC. And another 5 additional datasets, those were collected from different sources. Below I provide all of this dataset overview, their sources and what features I take from those datasets. \n\n1. **2016 School Explorer.csv:** Consolidated school characteristics such as student demographics and standardized test performance from public data sources for 1270 NYC public elementary and middle schools. I use a lot of features from this dataset. Like ENI, Average Math Proficiency, Ethnicity percentage and lot more. \n\n2. **D5 SHSAT Registrations and Testers.csv: ** District 5 (Central Harlem) SHSAT (Specialized High School Test) data from the NYC Department of Education: Time series enrollment, SHSAT registrations & participation for that community. When I started working on this challenge, I used its number of SHSAT takers column. But it only contains a very few school information. Later, I found a better dataset compare to this. \n\n3. **nytdf.csv:** From [this post](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/passnyc\/data-science-for-good\/discussion\/60308) I have collected this dataset. This is an output file of [this kerenel](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/rdisalv2\/parsing-nyt-shsat-table\/output). This contains the number of SHSAT taker information of at least over 550 schools. Instead of using D5 SHSAT Registrations and Testers dataset I use this dataset. Because it has more information. Though this dataset is collected from a Kernel and that kernel collect the data from NYT, this dataset is also currently available in [here](https:\/\/data.cityofnewyork.us\/Education\/2017-2018-SHSAT-Admissions-Test-Offers-By-Sending-\/vsgi-eeb5\/). \n\n4. **School Quality Dataset Report 2015-16:** This dataset is collected from [here](https:\/\/infohub.nyced.org\/reports-and-policies\/school-quality\/school-quality-reports-and-resources). It is a very informative dataset. This dataset is very useful for this challenge. I used many columns from this dataset. Those are\n       'Enrollment', 'Percent Students with Disabilities', 'Percent Self-Contained', 'Percent in Temp Housing', 'Percent HRA Eligible',  'Years of principal experience at this school', 'Percent of teachers with 3 or more years of experience',  'Teacher Attendance Rate'\n       \n5. **NYC Schools Details:** This dataset is collected from [here](https:\/\/nimader.carto.com\/tables\/elem_schools_infowindow_master_file_with_ratios_12_11\/public). It is a very useful and informative dataset. What uniques about this dataset is that it gives us each *schools zone family median income*. That was really helpful for this project. But I don't use this dataset in this notebook, because after merging this dataset with our school explorer dataset, I saw that this dataset has very few schools that were situated in New York City. For that reason, I don't use this dataset in this notebook. Though it doesn't mean it can't be used. In the future, it can useful for PASSNYC to further research. \n\n6. **NYC School Demographics:** This dataset is collected from [here](https:\/\/infohub.nyced.org\/reports-and-policies\/citywide-information-and-data\/information-and-data-overview). It is also a very useful dataset. It contains information about NYC School demographics. I use a few features from this dataset. Those are \n        'Total Enrollment','# Female', '# Male', '# Poverty', '% Poverty'\n        \n    In this dataset, there are also many features that I not used. It can be useful for further analysis. \n \n7. **NY 2010-2011 Class Size - School-level detail:** This dataset is also useful. It gives us much information about school class size and more in a granular way. I used class size feature from this dataset. \n ","869713e4":"\n    - In score_education_system, we can see that cluster 1 has highest score. And we know that number of SHSAT takers decreases with score_eduation_system. So, we can say that cluster 1 has lower number of SHSAT takers because of education syste. \n    \n    \n    - We can see that cluster 0 has lowest number of score in score_school_quality and score_gender. And we know the number of SHSAT takers increases with those score. So cluster 0 schools has lower number of SHSAT because of low school qualitly and low gender diversity. \n    \n    - We can see that cluster 4 has highest number of score in score_students_situation and score_education. And we know that number of SHSAT takers decrases with thsoe score. So cluster 4 has low number of SHSAT takers because of low students situations and low education. \n    \n    \n    There is a lot we can derive from this information.

So PASSNYC can help cluster 0 schools which these feature in mind. In this way, PASSNYC can help schools in a more granuler and accurate way that will bring more diverse students into SHSAT exam. \n   \n   ## Why this solutions is effective\n   The datasets used in the notebook are all school label meaning it's more granular.

","72dc4b58":"# Solution Overview\nI breakup the solution into two steps. First let's see some graphic of the solutions for easy understanding\n\n![Imgur](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/HwnOoQc.png)\n\n\n\n\nBefore solutions let's go to the problem first. The problem is the SHSAT exam is a gateway to get admission in NYC specialized schools. But if we analyze the NYC specialized high schools, we can see that there is not so diversity. Meaning Asian and white are the very higher percentage where black, female are low percentage. That's a few problems. So PASSNYC aim to get more students into the SHSAT exam, meaning diversity in SHSAT exam. That is the problem, how we can make SHSAT exam with more diversity. \n\n\nLet's come to my solution. The PASSNYC team provided us two datasets about NYC schools those are very useful. I have found other 5 additional datasets that are also useful and they are school label datasets. I merged them using DBN key. Then I take only useful column among this dataset and try to find the relationship with Number of SHSAT takers.  The new merged dataset has half of the rows compared to School exploere.csv dataset provided by PASSNYC. The reason for that the dataset nytdf.csv contains only half of the schools compared to School explore. Becuase we don't find any alternative we stick to it. The nytdf.csv has features called number of SHSAT takers. \n\n\nAfter that, I grouped all those useful columns in different fragment and calculated a weighted sum score for each group. Those groups are \n           \n           'score_education', 'score_educaton_system', 'score_school_quality','score_student_situation', 'score_gender'\nThen I try to find the relationship between these scores and number of SHSAT takers. Some scores are positively and some are negatively correlated with the number of SHSAT takers. \n\n\n\n![Imgur](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ALQRBs0.png)\nRemember that our merged dataset has half of the rows compared to school explorer dataset because of merging with nytdf.csv. Now let's merge our dataset again but this time I will not include nytdf.csv because we don't need it. Becuase we already see the relationship between the number of SHSAT takers and different calculated score. We can now tell our calculated score has relation with the number of SHSAT takers. So after the second merge with datasets(not included nytdf.csv), now calculated those score again. \n\n\nThen apply a clustering algorithm, I used Kmeans. Then we can see that 5 distinct clusters in school. Now assign the cluster number to each school. After that calculate the median score of each score category by grouping with cluster number. We can now see which cluster score in the different category. Now we know that which cluster's school is more underrepresented in which category. \n","40339a8d":"# Cluster 3","3dc89afa":"\n<a id='calculate_score_second_step'><\/a>\n\n# Calculate score\n> In this section, I will try to calculate score again for our new merged dataset.
