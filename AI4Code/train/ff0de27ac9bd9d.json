We used each player's attributes to decide on overall ratings\n* I used 2018-2019 football results from major leagues around the world and FIFA 19 dataset to train the model (around 3000 matches) \n* I created fixtures for the teams in CL and merged this table with FIFA 20 dataset so each team's attributes are calculated\n* Then I used k-NN algorithm to build the model and predict the outcome\n\n***What was the outcome of the model?***\n\n* The model provided 54% accuracy which is near to levels achieved by some academic studies as well (https:\/\/www.imperial.ac.uk\/media\/imperial-college\/faculty-of-engineering\/computing\/public\/1718-ug-projects\/Corentin-Herbinet-Using-Machine-Learning-techniques-to-predict-the-outcome-of-profressional-football-matches.pdf)\n\n***What could be further steps and development areas?***\n\n* Developing a different ML model: A linear regression model to determine how much goals would be scored by each team in each game or a decision tree model could be applied to see the outcomes and the accuracy\n* Data manipulation: More data regarding the form of each team, starting elevens, injuries, condition etc. could be added to the initial data for (hopefully) better accuracy. The model then could be runned just before each game to have a more accurate outcome\n\nPlease let me know in the comments if your team will make it to the next round or regarding the models itself!","d303e3e3":"Similar to what we have done for the keepers, we will now delete the rows for GK stats from this table","ed8b4ebc":"I also decided to drop some minor attributes that I believe that do not affect overall performance of the team","6babad6d":"Take a brief look at the data, using head and info functions","02b2d153":"**FUN PART BEGINS!!!**","286fa830":"Phew!

Thus, I will drop all the remaining columns from the database.","e6ab59c7":"So we see that there are some teams their names do not match with FIFA database, we need to make sure that they have the same name in both database. We need to amend their names on HomeStats and AwayStats databases","9c71d30b":"Now, it is time to read 2019\/2020 groups into the dataset. Unfortunately, Red Star FC and Zenit are not in FIFA 20 dataset, thus their CL groups consist of three teams each in this study.","f9db10b3":"Now we have the aggregate stats for 651 teams on FIFA 19","ee292e0b":"As a next step we will split the data as train and test, using a test size of 0.3","33ed6f13":"With a random k value chosen as 3, we see that our accuracy is 46%. However, this is not enough grouping size when we consider the nature of kNN algorithm. A good practice of choosing k in kNN is the square root of all samples. \n\nOn the other hand, I would like to find a near optimal value for k evaluating the error rate. Thus, I will produce a graph using a k value from 1 to 50 and see which k value will generate the least error rate.","e483aa46":"Control if there is any NaN values, if so what the reason is for this values","266db73e":"Normalize the data:","ab76b008":"I will drop Total Goals scored columns since it directly affects the outcome of the match (surprise!)","26604a57":"So we see that there are two different cases there:\n* Some columns that exists in FIFA 19 do not exist in FIFA 20 (and vice versa)\n* Some columns are named differently in two databases\n\nThus, we need to first eliminate the ones that makes the difference, then rename FIFA 20 columns according to FIFA 19 dataset"}}
