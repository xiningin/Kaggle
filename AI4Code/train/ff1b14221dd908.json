Should we be worried?\n\nWhen it comes to sample size estimation we need to tread carefully. The effect size is small here, which means we need decent samples in both sets of data. And by decent I mean we can calculate how many observations should be in each group.\n\nLet us say that we hypothesize that there is a higher fatality rate in countries who never had a universal BCG policy than their counterparts who do have a universal one. A test of hypothesis will be conducted to compare fatality rates of the countries who never had a universal BCG policy with the countries who did. If we deem that a 3 fold increase would be clinically meaningful(from 3% (the average in those countries with universal policy and who are IncomeLevel = 3 or 4) to 9% (Italy for instance)) then how many countries should be enrolled in the study to ensure that the power of the test is 80% to detect this difference in the groups? A two sided test will be used with a 5% level of significance.\n\nWe first compute the effect size (ES) by substituting the proportions of cases in each group who are expected to pass away from the disease, p1=0.09 (i.e., 0.03*3.0=0.09) and p2=0.03 and the overall proportion, p=0.06 (i.e., (0.09+0.03)\/2):","fd1de5a0":"As per the paper the high income:never had a universal policy is standing out again.

Countries were divided in three categories: low income (L) with an annual income of 1,025 dollars or less, lower middle income with an income between 1,026 and 3,995 dollars, and middle high and high income countries, which included countries with annual incomes over 3,996 dollars.\"","144e77f1":"Let us read in the data and explore their headers:","5d3e9ec5":"rename Country to Country_Region:","8eb2c5d4":"Just a note regarding the paper as quoted above. You will notice that the paper uses the word 'might'. In fact the paper uses it a total of 8 times. Most of the time these types of words are used when there is no data to back up what is being said. That could affect the rational basis with which we are to accept some or all of the findings in the paper. Similar words to watch out for in papers are: maybe, could be, over time, scientists think, scientists feel, scientists believe...\n\nIn the above case the speculation is that the mortality rate 'might' be influenced by multiple factors such as a countrys standard of medical care. What we would need to do now is go and consult other research, if any, that might give us a data driven answer to that assertion. That said, if the paper did not already cite other research in that direction then there probably is not much on it.","a6dc32f0":"Right off the bat BCG policy = 3 (which translates to never having had a universal one) is visibly higher ito case fatality rate.
