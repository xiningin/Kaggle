We may derive the following assertions from the data provided:\n\n<br>\n\n\n1.   There are about **15** automobile models that get a higher miles per gallon than the average.\n2.    In terms of miles per gallon, the E class vehicle outperforms the G class model by more than **5.4 percent**.  \n3. When the miles\/gallon mean value is greater, the automobile can drive **further** than when the mean value is lower. \n4.

Diesel engines are limited for vehicles that have a high frequency of travel, such as trucks, buses, and off-road vehicles, despite having higher efficiency and lower costs than petroleum.

For those who want to buy a car for travel or daily use, the miles per gallon number should be greater than 30 mpg.\n2. Mileage is another element that influences a vehicle's fuel usage. The cost of maintaining a car is determined by its mileage.\n3. Manual transmissions have more gears and a simpler design, making them lighter.\n4. Diesel engines are restricted for vehicles that travel often, such as trucks, buses, and off-road vehicles, due to higher greenhouse gas emissions.","aa11f174":"## Insights\n\n---\n\n<br>\n\n**Road Tax Description**:  <br>\n1. It is a tax that must be paid by anybody who purchases a car. The Road Tax is a state-level tax, meaning that it is imposed at the state level by the governments of several states.\n2. For charging the road tax, each state has its own set of rules and regulations. The amount of tax varies due to the varied percentages charged by different states. According to the Central Motor Vehicles Act, if a vehicle is operated for more than a year, the entire amount of road tax must be paid at once. <br>\n\n3. Individuals purchasing a vehicle pay the road tax which is based on the ex-showroom price of the vehicle. The calculation of road tax depends on these following things:\n\n  a. Seating capacity of the vehicle <br>\n  b. Engine capacity of the vehicle <br>\n  c. Age of the vehicle <br>\n  d.
