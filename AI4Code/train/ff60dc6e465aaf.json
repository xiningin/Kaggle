Here we list the provided attributes and the number of annotations associated with a particular attribute.","c58b35a1":"## Reverse indexing and short-cuts\n\nThe dataset tables are normalized, meaning that each piece of information is only given once.\nFor example, there is one `map` record for each `log` record. Looking at the schema you will notice that the `map` table has a `log_token` field, but that the `log` table does not have a corresponding `map_token` field. But there are plenty of situations where you have a `log`, and want to find the corresponding `map`! So what to do? You can always use the `level5data.field2token()` method, but that is slow and inconvenient. The devkit therefore adds reverse mappings for some common situations including this one.\n\nFurther, there are situations where one needs to go through several tables to get a certain piece of information. \nConsider, for example, the category name of a `sample_annotation`. The `sample_annotation` table doesn't hold this information since the category is an instance level constant. Instead the `sample_annotation` table points to a record in the `instance` table. This, in turn, points to a record in the `category` table, where finally the `name` fields stores the required information.\n\nSince it is quite common to want to know the category name of an annotation, we add a `category_name` field to the `sample_annotation` table during initialization of the NuScenes class.\n\nIn this section, we list the short-cuts and reverse indices that are added to the `NuScenes` class during initialization. These are all created in the `NuScenes.__make_reverse_index__()` method.","b3a463eb":"Instead of looking at camera and lidar data separately, we can also project the lidar pointcloud into camera images:","ab40dc19":"Finally, let's assert that we recovered the same ann_records as we did using level5data.field2token:","49d6127e":"We generally track an instance across different frames in a particular scene.
