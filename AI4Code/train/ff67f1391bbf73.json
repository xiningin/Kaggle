How much of the global energy demand is currently supplied by renewable sources? \n\n\n**Analysis Structure**\n\nThis report will begin by analyzing the energy generated from renewable sources, and the countries leading the way in the renewable sector. Next, it will look into the national, and continent\/group consumption statistics to provide context and illustrate the increases required in order for renewables to overcome non-renewables as the main source of energy. Lastly, it will outline the current demand in comparison to the supply of renewable energy available. \n\n","68c179b4":"**Global Energy Consumption**","c5fc551d":"While the amount of hydro power produced globally increased 89.3% over the last 27 years, and that from Biofuel 28,954.38%, solar energy has led way, increasing an astounding 49,2733.33%. Even after the initial higher increases post-PV 2010, we maintained roughly a 32% increase per year from 2013-2017. \n\nIn addition to the development of Photovoltaic (PV) solar panels in 2010, novel nature-inspired optimization algorithms for renewable energy generation, distribution and management, policy is also playing a key role. More specifically, policies like those in California which demands homes built after 2020 have solar roofing, German solar panel rebates and other financial incentives, and Australia's blockchain powered micro-grids that utilize AI to buy and sell excess energy, are all pushing the sector further. \n\nHowever, storage is still a major hurdle, preventing renewables, specifically, solar and wind from capturing 40% of the worlds energy market, as projected for 2040. Accordingly, to overcome the issues regarding the overuse of precious metals required for batteries, bio-technologists are exploring possibilities to substitute conventional lithium-ion batteries with synthetic polypeptides -- which make up proteins -- and other polymers. Combine this, with Polychromatic solar energy conversion, and the future of solar energy starts to look even brighter. \n\nThis being said, what this dataset left out, is time series data for Global Wind Production (TWh), which would be interesting to compare with the improvements of solar.

Although innovations will help balance these increases to an extent, much of the change required is from a social perspective and conceptions of materialism, value, 'progress' and 'development'. Thankfully the fallacy of the 'American Dream', and its harm to the environment and to society has been exposed in recent decades, and a new 'Global Dream' is slowly being formed thanks to international policy agreements and broader social movements such as 'Friday's for Future', the SDGs, and the Paris Climate Agreement. ","cc5b6595":"China's development progress, and its ability to lift millions out of poverty in the last 20 years, is also reflected in their increased energy consumption, as shown above. Accordingly, the BRICS and Asia figures show similar trends and one can expect Africa to be next in line. \n\nIn turn, this sheds some light on the intense ramifications that will occur as the large populations of many developing nations such as India, Thailand, and Brazil are lifted from poverty and begin consuming like those in the North, especially the US, which has. and to a large content, continues to, promote a 'dream' and lifestyle of conpicious consumtion and material wealth. The question remains as to how such social mobility can be achieved in a sustainable manner and that incorporates value not only based on the destruction of ecological resources, and what this says to the many populations who have been chasing, and promised such. \n\nAlthough, 2020, was the first year in many, that global energy consumption declined for many developed\/OECD nations, as viewed in the continent\/group figure above, it is difficult to surmise exactly how much of this is a result of increased renewable useage, or social and value changes that have shifted from materialism to experience and access based forms of value. It is interesting to note that Japan has maintened a negative consumption growth rate the last 4 years, with minimal increases over the last 15, and in relative numbers, is roughly half that of the US. To get a better picture of the intensity of US power consumption, lets do a few comparisons in terms of per\/capita - see below. \n\n","7f6e8923":"**Top 20 Countries Generating Renewable Energy**"}}
