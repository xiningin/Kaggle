Of course, this number has been much higher in recent months. The situation is better than those months, but as long as we are not cautious, the current situation shows that we are imprudent, the number of cases may increase or decrease, but unfortunately it does not end. This situation seems to take longer. I hope we will all get through it as soon as possible.\n\nNow let's save our chart as .png. We will use plt.savefig for this. Let's add it to our chart now.","c9745fe0":"As you can see, there is a table with 115 rows. 115 is a bit too much for a single chart. I wanted to give a specific range to make the chart look smoother. We will give an interval and show the date and daily deaths on the chart. \nI used the \"loc\" function to make it easier to select and put it into a new variable. Now we will do the operations with our new variable.","f23374a1":"And our graph showing the number of corona deaths between 30.05.2020-03.07.2020 . . .\n\nWhile 26 people died on the 30th of May, the corona experienced its decline on the 13th of June. \nI want to add a grid to the chart to see the data more clearly.","0610e67e":"****2-Taking the dataset****","89bbcccc":"# Turkey Coronavirus Data Analysis with Python","8713e228":"We're going to make some adjustments now.

The data are received from Turkey's health ministry data page. \n\nWe will show the analysis on the chart and make inferences about the subject. Next we will see how to save the chart as .png.","c165cfb6":"Yes :) After adding plt.savefig to the graphic and making the settings, the picture will be saved in the file directory of your project.\n\nThat's all for now. You can review the data set in more detail by making updates. I wanted to write something small for guidance. I hope it will help. \n\nThank you for taking the time to read. Healthy days . . ."}}
