This is because it is very important for a data scientist to be able to understand the nature of the data without making assumptions. The results of data exploration can be extremely useful in grasping the structure of the data, the distribution of the values, and the presence of extreme values and interrelationships within the data set.\n\n### The purpose of EDA is:\n\nto use summary statistics and visualizations to better understand data, *find clues about the tendencies of the data, its quality and to formulate assumptions and the hypothesis of our analysis\nFor data preprocessing to be successful, it is essential to have an overall picture of your data Basic statistical descriptions can be used to identify properties of the data and highlight which data values should be treated as noise or outliers.**\n\nNext step is to explore the data. There are two approached used to examine the data using:\n\n**Descriptive statistics** is the process of condensing key characteristics of the data set into simple numeric metrics. Some of the common metrics used are mean, standard deviation, and correlation.\n\n**Visualization** is the process of projecting the data, or parts of it, into Cartesian space or into abstract images. In the data mining process, data exploration is leveraged in many different steps including preprocessing, modeling, and interpretation of results.","7a6145d0":"## **Visualise distribution of data via box plots**\n## Box plot \"_mean\" suffix designition","c787d811":"#**Using Predictive Analysis To Predict Diagnosis of a Breast Tumor**\n-By Mohd.Shoaib Nadaf\n\n## 1. Identify the problem\nBreast cancer is the most common malignancy among women, accounting for nearly 1 in 3 cancers diagnosed among women in the United States, and it is the second leading cause of cancer death among women. Breast Cancer occurs as a results of abnormal growth of cells in the breast tissue, commonly referred to as a Tumor. A tumor does not mean cancer - tumors can be benign (not cancerous), pre-malignant (pre-cancerous), or malignant (cancerous). Tests such as MRI, mammogram, ultrasound and biopsy are commonly used to diagnose breast cancer performed.\n\n## 1.1 Expected outcome\nGiven breast cancer results from breast fine needle aspiration (FNA) test (is a quick and simple procedure to perform, which removes some fluid or cells from a breast lesion or cyst (a lump, sore or swelling) with a fine needle similar to a blood sample needle). Since this build a model that can classify a breast cancer tumor using two training classification:\n\n1= Malignant (Cancerous) - Present\n0= Benign (Not Cancerous) -Absent\n\n## 1.2 Objective\nSince the labels in the data are discrete, the predication falls into two categories, (i.e. Malignant or benign). In machine learning this is a classification problem.\n\nThus, the goal is to classify whether the breast cancer is benign or malignant and predict the recurrence and non-recurrence of malignant cases after a certain period. To achieve this we have used machine learning classification methods to fit a function that can predict the discrete class of new input.\n\n## 1.3 Identify data sources\nThe Breast Cancer datasets is available machine learning repository maintained by the University of California, Irvine. The dataset contains 569 samples of malignant and benign tumor cells.\n\nThe first two columns in the dataset store the unique ID numbers of the samples and the corresponding diagnosis (M=malignant, B=benign), respectively.\nThe columns 3-32 contain 30 real-value features that have been computed from digitized images of the cell nuclei, which can be used to build a model to predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant.\n\n\n\n","16c3ff2d":"**Getting Started: Load libraries and set options**\n","11947dbf":"**Corelation Matrix**"}}
