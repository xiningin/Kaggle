Isotonic calibration didn't work perfectly either, however it did appear to improve the model's discrimination a small bit (the model without calibration has slightly poorer discrimination in that it is more likely to predict probabilities which are close to 0.5).  Isotonic calibration is usually only recommended if one has $>>1000$ datapoints, which we do (the training set contains around 300,000 datapoins), so we'll go ahead and use isotonic calibration.  Now we can output our predictions after calibrating.","bba349b7":"<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"feature-encoding\"><\/a>\n## Feature Encoding\n\nSome columns are non-numeric and will have to be encoded to numeric types so that our predictive algorithm can handle them.  We'll encode cyclical variables (like day of the week) into 2 dimensions, encode features with only two possible classes by assigning them 0 or 1, and one-hot encode categorical features with more than two classes.\n\nThe column `WEEKDAY_APPR_PROCESS_START` contains categorical information corresponding to the day of the week.  We could encode these categories as the values 1-7, but this would imply that Sunday and Monday are more similar than, say Tuesday and Sunday.  We could also one-hot encode the column into 7 new columns, but that would create 7 additional dimensions.  Seeing as the week is cyclical, we'll encode this information into two dimensions by encoding them using polar coordinates.  That is, we'll represent the days of the week as a circle.  That way, we can encode the days of the week independently, but only add two dimensions.","a9abeef2":"<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"baseline-predictions\"><\/a>\n## Baseline Predictions\n\nAs a baseline, let's use XGBoost with all the default parameters to predict the probabilities of applicants having trouble repaying their loans.","d1c42adf":"The gender column contains whether the loan applicant was male or female.  The training datset contains 4 values which weren't empty but were labelled `XNA`.  Normally we would want to create a new column to represent when the gender value is null.  However,  since the test dataset has only `M` and `F` entries, and because there are only 4 entries with a gender of `XNA` in the training set, we'll remove those entries from the training set.","9bcc60dd":"<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"calibration\"><\/a>\n## Calibration\n\nOne problem with the tree-based model is that the predicted probabilities tend to be overconfident.  That is, when the actual probability of class=1 is closer to 0.5, the model predicts probabilities closer to 0 or 1 than 0.5.  We can measure the extent of this overconfidence (or underconfidence) of our classifier by looking at its calibration curve.  The calibration curve plots the probability predicted by our model against the actual probability of samples in that bin.  A model which is perfectly calibrated should show a calibration curve which lies on the identity (y=x) line.","dda572bc":"<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"manual-feature-engineering\"><\/a>\n## Manual Feature Engineering\n\nWe'll add some features which may be informative as to how likely an applicant is to repay their loan:\n\n- The proportion of the applicant's life they have been employed.

If a 50-year-old has only ever been employed for 4 years, they may have trouble repaying their loan.\n- The ratio of credit to income.  More income than credit will likely help an applicant be able to repay their loan.\n- The ratio of income to annuity.\n- The ratio of income to annuity scaled by age.\n- The ratio of credit to annuity.  If an applicant has a high level of credit relative to their annuity, they may have trouble repaying their loan.\n- The ratio of credit to annuity, scaled by age.

However, if one value for a given PREFIX is empty, the other values for that PREFIX will also be empty.  \n\nFor each column which has some empty values, we want to add an indicator column which is 1 if the value in the corresponding column is empty, and 0 otherwise.  However, if we do this with the housing-related features, we'll end up with a bunch of duplicate columns!  This is because the same samples have null values across all the POSTFIX columns for a given PREFIX.   The same problem crops up with the CREDIT_BUREAU-related features. To handle this problem, after creating the null indicator columns, we'll check for duplicate columns and merge them.\n\nSo, first we'll add columns to indicate where there are empty values in each other column.","b358a0da":"Then we'll one-hot encode the categorical features which have more than 2 possible values.","009de8c5":"$350,000$ days?

Isotonic calibration (which calibrates the model's predictions using a method based on isotonic regression)\n\nWe'll try both methods, and see if either betters the calibration of our model.","9885eeb3":"<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"feature-importance\"><\/a>\n## Feature Importance\n\nFor our final predictions, we'll use the isotonic calibrated model with no resampling (which we've already used to make predictions on the test data, back in the [calibration](#calibration) section), since resampling didn't appear to help increase the preformance of our model.  We can view how important each feature was to the model's predictions by using XGBoost's `plot_importance` function.","6a989c32":"# Home Credit Group Loan Risk Prediction\n\n[Home Credit Group](http:\/\/www.homecredit.net\/) is a financial institution which specializes in consumer lending, especially to people with little credit history.  In order to determine what a reasonable principal is for applicants, and a repayment schedule which will help their clients sucessfully repay their loans, Home Credit Group wants to use data about the applicant to predict how likely they are to be able to repay their loan.  Home Credit Group recently hosted a [kaggle competition](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/home-credit-default-risk) to predict loan repayment probability from (anonymized) applicant information.  In this kernel, we'll try and predict loan repayment ability.\n\n## Outline\n\n* [Data Loading and Cleaning](#data-loading-and-cleaning)\n* [Manual Feature Engineering](#manual-feature-engineering)\n* [Feature Encoding](#feature-encoding)\n* [Baseline Predictions](#baseline-predictions)\n* [Calibration](#calibration)\n* [Resampling](#resampling)\n* [Final Predictions and Feature Importance](#final-predictions)\n\nFirst let's load the packages we'll use.","194f02e2":"We'll merge the test and training dataset, and create a column which indicates whether a sample is in the test or train dataset.  That way, we can perform operations (label encoding, one-hot encoding, etc) to all the data together instead of doing it once to the training data and once to the test data.","9cabbd51":"Similarly, in the `NAME_FAMILY_STATUS` column, there were 2 entries in the training set with values of `Unknown`, and no entries with that value in the test set.  So, we'll remove those too.","e9689191":"There were some funky values in the `DAYS_EMPLOYED` column:","57a3b8ee":"Unfortunately it looks like none of the sampling techniques actually helped improve the AUROC score!  The SMOTE resampling technique did even more poorly than simply under- or over-sampling.  This is probably because SMOTE generates samples by interpolating between training samples in feature-space, but most of our features are binary.  So, interpolation isn't really adding diversity to the training data, it's just adding noise and making it more difficult for our classification algorithm to decide where to put a threshold in that dimension.","849c85c2":"We'll use the [imbalanced-learn](http:\/\/contrib.scikit-learn.org\/imbalanced-learn\/stable\/index.html) package to re-sample our dataset such that the classes are balanced.  There are several different common methods we could use for re-sampling: \n\n1. Random over-sampling (randomly repeat minority class examples in the training data)\n1. Random under-sampling (randomly drop majority class examples from the training data)\n1. Synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE, generate additional synthetic training examples which are similar to the minority class)\n\nWe'll try all three techniques, and see if any of the techniques give better predictive performance in terms of the AUROC.","74de0ceb":"And now we can take a look at the data we're working with.  ","bf7b214e":"The column containing the values we are trying to predict, `TARGET`, doesn't contain any missing values.  The value of `TARGET` is $0$ when the loan was repayed sucessfully, and $1$ when there were problems repaying the loan.  Many more loans were succesfully repayed than not, which means that the dataset is imbalanced in terms of our dependent variable, which is something we'll have to watch out for when we build a predictive model later:","92283813":"Then we can label encode categorical features with only 2 possible values (that is, turn the labels into either 0 or 1).","befb632a":"## Conclusion\n\nAfter building a predictive model, there are a few things Home Credit should consider before putting it in to production.  Firstly, because this model could have a direct effect on large number of individuals' financial lives, we need to ensure our model is being equitable, and isn't [discriminating by proxy](https:\/\/digitalcommons.law.umaryland.edu\/fac_pubs\/285\/) against certain groups based on race, gender, ethnicity, etc.  Also, because we used applicants' personal information to train the model, we should ensure that those applicants have been informed their information would be used for such a purpose, that they have given consent, and that we have minimized the personally identifiable information present in the dataset.  Still other ethical issues exist which we would want to address before putting our model into production.  There are tools to help us ensure our model and data practices more ethical, such as checklists like [Deon](http:\/\/deon.drivendata.org\/) and toolkits like the [Ethics and Algorithms Toolkit](https:\/\/ethicstoolkit.ai\/).\n\nAnother thing to prepare for when considering putting a predictive model into deployment is the possibility of covariate shift or concept drift.  We would want to have a monitoring system in place for a deployed model which could alert us when our data inputs appear to be changing over time, or when our model is no longer fitting the data as well as it used to (or, generally, when things are changing unexpectedly).  For example, if the `EXT_SOURCE` features are indeed credit scores from external agencies, if one of those agencies were to change their scoring system, the score distribution would change, and this would have a large effect on *our* system's predictions.\n\nFinally, remember that the point of building a predictive model to estimate how likely applicants are to pay back their loans is not just for Home Credit Group to use that information to accept or reject applicants.  Rather, they want to be able to predict which principal and payment plan would be the best option for each applicant.  An even more useful model would be one which predicted loan repayment probability given not only the applicant information, but also information about the proposed principal and payment schedule.  This way, Home Credit Group could use the model as a tool to decide not only whether to accept or reject applicants, but to determine the specifics of a loan which would be best for each of their applicants. ","19398bd9":"The `NAME_INCOME_TYPE` column also contained entries for applicants who were on Maternity leave, but no such applicants were in the test set.  There were only 5 such applicants in the training set, so we'll remove these from the training set.","b010e9ca":"<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"resampling\"><\/a>\n## Resampling\n\nThe target class is very imbalanced: many more people successfully repaid their loans than had trouble repaying.","c9f28780":"And finally we'll remove duplicate columns.  We'll hash the columns and check if the hashes match before checking if all the values actually match, because it's a lot faster than comparing $O(N^2)$ columns elementwise.","94fd6880":"Indeed female applicants only default on their loans around 7% of the time, while male applicants default around 10% of the time."}}
