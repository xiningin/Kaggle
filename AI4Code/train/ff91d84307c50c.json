For a very quick introduction to the coding environment, [check out this video](https:\/\/youtu.be\/4C2qMnaIKL4).\n\nKernels (also known as notebooks) are composed of blocks (called \"cells\") of text and code. Each of these is editable, though you'll mainly be editing the code cells to answer some questions.\n\nTo get started, try running the code cell below (by pressing the \u25ba button, or clicking on the cell and pressing ctrl+enter on your keyboard).","c1fdeb0d":"<hr\/>\n## 2.\n\nAdd code to the following cell to swap variables `a` and `b` (so that `a` refers to the object previously referred to by `b` and vice versa).","62c76d7d":"Try adding another line of code in the cell above and re-running it. \n\nNow let's get a little fancier:  Add a new code cell by clicking on an existing code cell, hitting the escape key, and then hitting the `a` or `b` key.  The `a` key will add a cell above the current cell, and `b` adds a cell below.\n\nGreat! Now you know how to use Kernels.\n\nEach hands-on exercise starts by setting up our feedback and code checking mechanism. Run the code cell below to do that. Then you'll be ready to move on to question 0.","afe2f28c":"# Keep Going\n\nYou are ready for **[functions and getting help](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/colinmorris\/functions-and-getting-help).**\n","904955b6":"<hr\/>\n## 3.\n\n<!-- TODO: Or maybe this SHOULD just have a check method for consistency.-->\n\n<small>*Note: some questions, such as this one, don't have a .check() function.
