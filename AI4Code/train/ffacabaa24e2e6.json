We want to do this early in our project and match these quick correlations with modelled correlations later in the project.\n\n**Completing.**\n\n1. We may want to complete Age feature as it is definitely correlated to survival.\n2. We may want to complete the Embarked feature as it may also correlate with survival or another important feature.\n\n**Correcting.**\n\n1. Ticket feature may be dropped from our analysis as it contains high ratio of duplicates (22%) and there may not be a correlation between Ticket and survival.\n2. Cabin feature may be dropped as it is highly incomplete or contains many null values both in training and test dataset.\n3. PassengerId may be dropped from training dataset as it does not contribute to survival.\n4. Name feature is relatively non-standard, may not contribute directly to survival, so maybe dropped.\n\n**Creating.**\n\n1. We may want to create a new feature called Family based on Parch and SibSp to get total count of family members on board.\n2. We may want to engineer the Name feature to extract Title as a new feature.\n3. We may want to create new feature for Age bands.

So, median Age for Pclass=1 and Gender=0, Pclass=1 and Gender=1, and so on...\n\n3. Combine methods 1 and 2.

For example: Master title has Age mean of 5 years.\n- Survival among Title Age bands varies slightly.\n- Certain titles mostly survived (Mme, Lady, Sir) or did not (Don, Rev, Jonkheer).\n\n**Decision.**\n\n- We decide to retain the new Title feature for model training.","206ce5d2":"In machine learning, naive Bayes classifiers are a family of simple probabilistic classifiers based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions between the features. Naive Bayes classifiers are highly scalable, requiring a number of parameters linear in the number of variables (features) in a learning problem.

The histogram can indicate distribution of samples using automatically defined bins or equally ranged bands. This helps us answer questions relating to specific bands (Did infants have better survival rate?)\n\nNote that x-axis in historgram visualizations represents the count of samples or passengers.\n\n**Observations.**\n\n- Infants (Age <=4) had high survival rate.\n- Oldest passengers (Age = 80) survived.\n- Large number of 15-25 year olds did not survive.\n- Most passengers are in 15-35 age range.\n\n**Decisions.**\n\nThis simple analysis confirms our assumptions as decisions for subsequent workflow stages.\n\n- We should consider Age (our assumption classifying #2) in our model training.\n- Complete the Age feature for null values (completing #1).\n- We should band age groups (creating #3).","0c177d1c":"Now we can safely drop the Name feature from training and testing datasets.

A sample is classified by a majority vote of its neighbors, with the sample being assigned to the class most common among its k nearest neighbors (k is a positive integer, typically small). If k = 1, then the object is simply assigned to the class of that single nearest neighbor.

Tree models where the target variable can take a finite set of values are called classification trees; in these tree structures, leaves represent class labels and branches represent conjunctions of features that lead to those class labels. Decision trees where the target variable can take continuous values (typically real numbers) are called regression trees.
