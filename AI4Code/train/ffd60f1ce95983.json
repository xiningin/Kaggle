The modern NFL draft is split into 7 rounds, with 32 selections per round. These two charts examine the likelihood of finding an All-Pro or Pro-Bowl caliber player by round. These graphs confirm that the vast majority of high-quality players come from the first two rounds.\n\n\n##### NFL Team Quarterback Draft Selections:\nThe modern NFL has seen significantly higher player movement, while also emphasizing the importance of the quarterback position. However, this graph has some interesting takeaways.\n- prior to 2000, it was unlikely that a franchise quarterback would ever leave a team.\n- More high-level quarterbacks are leaving the teams that draft them (Peyton Manning to the Broncos, Tom Brady to the Buccaneers - both winning Super Bowls with these new teams).\n- Drafting a high number of Pro Bowl players is not a guarantee of team success.\n- (see the San Diego Chargers - drafted Phillip Rivers, Eli Manning, and Drew Brees, but traded away Drew Brees to the Saints, could not keep Manning, and perennially underperformed with Rivers). No Super Bowl victories.\n- Biggest takeaway is to draft and keep good quarterbacks.\n\n##### Field Goal Results:\nThis Special Teams data is extremely interesting. This scatterplot displays field goal attempts and the results of those attempts. The hypothesis here was that long field goal attempts with very few yards to go on the down are generally bad decisions. My hypothesis is strongly supported by checking out the quadrants high on the y-axis and to the left on the x-axis. The value of attempting a long field goal (45+ yards) while having low yards to go (less than 5) has far more poor results than attempting a fourth down conversions.\n\nIn particular, we see a high number of missed field goals and blocked attempts vs a high-percentage 4th down conversion attempt.\n\n##### USC Quarterbacks:\nThis has been one of my pet theories for a long time (with a small sample size). The University of Southern California has traditionally been known as a football powerhouse on both the college and NFL landscape. The data shows that they have provided a high number of excellent NFL players, specifically at the Offensive Tackle position and Defensive Backs (think Ronnie Lott). I always joke that a team should never draft a USC quarterback.\n\nLuckily, the data strongly supports this - despite having 5 quarterbacks drafted in the first round, collectively they have never made an All-Pro team and only five Pro Bowls, four of which were by Carson Palmer late in his career.\n\n1.
